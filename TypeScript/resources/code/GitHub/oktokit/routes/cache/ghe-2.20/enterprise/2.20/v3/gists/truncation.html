<p>The Gist API provides up to one megabyte of content for each file in the gist. Each file returned for a gist through the API has a key called <code>truncated</code>. If <code>truncated</code> is <code>true</code>, the file is too large and only a portion of the contents were returned in <code>content</code>.</p>
<p>If you need the full contents of the file, you can make a <code>GET</code> request to the URL specified by <code>raw_url</code>. Be aware that for files larger than ten megabytes, you&apos;ll need to clone the gist via the URL provided by <code>git_pull_url</code>.</p>
<p>In addition to a specific file&apos;s contents being truncated, the entire files list may be truncated if the total number exceeds 300 files. If the top level <code>truncated</code> key is <code>true</code>, only the first 300 files have been returned in the files list. If you need to fetch all of the gist&apos;s files, you&apos;ll need to clone the gist via the URL provided by <code>git_pull_url</code>.</p>
