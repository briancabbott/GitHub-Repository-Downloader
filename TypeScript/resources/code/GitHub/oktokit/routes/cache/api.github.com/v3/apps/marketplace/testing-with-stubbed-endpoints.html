<p>This API includes endpoints that allow you to <a href="/marketplace/integrating-with-the-github-marketplace-api/testing-github-marketplace-apps/">test your GitHub App</a> with <strong>stubbed data</strong>. Stubbed data is hard-coded, fake data that will not change based on actual subscriptions.</p>
<p>To test with stubbed data, use a stubbed endpoint in place of its production counterpart. This allows you to test whether API logic succeeds before listing GitHub Apps on GitHub Marketplace.</p>
<p>Be sure to replace stubbed endpoints with production endpoints before deploying your GitHub App.</p>
