<p>To ensure there can always be an active deployment, you can only delete an <em>inactive</em> deployment. Anyone with <code>repo</code> or <code>repo_deployment</code> scopes can delete an inactive deployment.</p>
<p>To set a deployment as inactive, you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new deployment that is active so that the system has a record of the current state, then delete the previously active deployment.</li>
<li>Mark the active deployment as inactive by adding any non-successful deployment status.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see &quot;<a href="#create-a-deployment">Create a deployment</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="#create-a-deployment-status">Create a deployment status</a>.&quot;</p>
