<p>In order for GitHub Enterprise to send webhook payloads, your server needs to be accessible from the Internet. We also highly suggest using SSL so that we can send encrypted payloads over HTTPS.</p>
<p>For more best practices, <a href="/enterprise/2.21/guides/best-practices-for-integrators/">see our guide</a>.</p>

<p>GitHub Enterprise will send along several HTTP headers to differentiate between event types and payload identifiers. See <a href="/enterprise/2.21/webhooks/event-payloads/#delivery-headers">webhook headers</a> for details.</p>
