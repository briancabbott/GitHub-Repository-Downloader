<p><strong>Deprecation Notice:</strong> This endpoint route is deprecated and will be removed from the Teams API. We recommend migrating your existing code to use the new <a href="/enterprise/2.21/v3/teams/members/#remove-team-membership-for-a-user">Remove team membership for a user</a> endpoint.</p>
</div>
<p>To remove a membership between a user and a team, the authenticated user must have &apos;admin&apos; permissions to the team or be an owner of the organization that the team is associated with. Removing team membership does not delete the user, it just removes their membership from the team.</p>
