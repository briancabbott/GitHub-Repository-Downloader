We recommend migrating your existing code to use the new [Get team membership for a user](https://developer.github.com/enterprise/2.21/v3/teams/members/#get-team-membership-for-a-user) endpoint.\n\nTeam members will include the members of child teams.\n\nTo get a user's membership with a team, the team must be visible to the authenticated user.\n\n**Note:** The `role` for organization owners returns as `maintainer`. For more information about `maintainer` roles, see [Create a team](https://developer.github.com/enterprise/2.21/v3/teams/#create-a-team).",
