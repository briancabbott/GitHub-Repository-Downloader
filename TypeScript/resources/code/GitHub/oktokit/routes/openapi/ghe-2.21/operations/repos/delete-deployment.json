  "description": "To ensure there can always be an active deployment, you can only delete an _inactive_ deployment. Anyone with `repo` or `repo_deployment` scopes can delete an inactive deployment.\n\nTo set a deployment as inactive, you must:\n\n*   Create a new deployment that is active so that the system has a record of the current state, then delete the previously active deployment.\n*   Mark the active deployment as inactive by adding any non-successful deployment status.\n\nFor more information, see \"[Create a deployment](https://developer.github.com/enterprise/2.21/v3/repos/deployments/#create-a-deployment)\" and \"[Create a deployment status](https://developer.github.com/enterprise/2.21/v3/repos/deployments/#create-a-deployment-status).\"",
