As a result, blog was added to a route set\r\nas a `user_blog`, but helper was generated for just `blog`.\r\n\r\nThis commit applies the proper logic for defining a helper for a mounted\r\nengine nested in resources or resource block.\r\n\r\n(closes #8533)\r\n```",

During initialization of ActiveRecord objects we got:\r\n```\r\nArgumentError: bad value for range\r\n\t.../activerecord-4.0.0/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/postgresql/oid.rb:162:in `initialize'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt doesn't work because following code is not valid ruby code: `(Time.now .. Float::INFINITY)`\r\n\r\nI think that `DateTime::Infinity` is better candidate to set infinite bounds for those ranges. Mostly because it allows to maintain similar behaviour between Time, Date and DateTime objects. I made a small extension to make it more predictable in comparison operations and modifications using durations.\r\n",

    "body": "originally submitted via https://github.com/rails/strong_parameters/pull/174\r\n\r\nWas getting errors related to 'format' not being allowed as a param. Having to permit 'format' everywhere is messy, but I wasn't sure about changing S.P. to always allow format for everyone, since it is a client-supplied param and there may be some valid reason to allow control over permittance of 'format' rather than always permitting it. It seemed that just allowing NEVER_UNPERMITTED_PARAMS to be modifiable would be the best idea, so I converted it into a configuration option, using fewer double negatives (\"always_permitted_parameters\"). Not sure if that works for everyone or not, so this is really just a conversation starter.",

    "body": "I was surprised to find out that relation's `none?` method was loading the entire collection as an array,\r\neven if no block or limit was given. This contrasts how `any?` and `many?` work, which is to use `LIMIT 1` and `COUNT` respectively, if no block and limit is given.\r\n\r\nIMO it's more natural to use `.none?` query rather than either `empty?` (because `empty?` is an Array method while `none?` is an Enumerable method and thus seems more suitable for a generic set such a a set of database rows). I therefore changed `none?` to follow the already existing behavior for `any?` and `many?`. \r\n\r\nI also implemented an optimized `one?` for similar reasons and for completion sake - just as me, others could be surprised that `one?` behaves differently than `any?` and `many?`, and I don't see a drawback to being consistent in providing an efficient implementation if possible.\r\n\r\nThis change applies to relations (e.g. `User.all`) as well as associations (e.g. `account.users`).\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nusers.none?\r\nSELECT \"users\".* FROM \"users\"\r\n \r\nusers.one?\r\nSELECT \"users\".* FROM \"users\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nusers.none?\r\nSELECT 1 AS one FROM \"users\" LIMIT 1\r\n\r\nusers.one?\r\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM \"users\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n`NullRelation` has been updated to short-curciut `none?` and `one?`, as it already does with `any?` and `many?`.\r\n\r\nAlso, improved method documentation a bit.\r\n\r\nI added the (appropriately modified) same set of tests as present for `any?` and `many?` methods in `relations_test.rb` and `associations/has_many_association_test.rb` unit tests.\r\n",

To my surprise, there were quite a few validation errors!\r\n\r\nNow, `rake guides:validate` returns no errors and `rake guides:generate WARNINGS=1` returns no warnings.\r\n\r\nI left these commits small and separate, please instruct if you wish me to squash them.\r\n\r\nExpect a PR soon moving the guides to HTML5, hopefully it won't be too much work!",

Every time you update a comment its commentable should be touched.\r\nThis was working when you changed attributes on the comment or when you moved the comment from one book to another. However, it was not working when moving a comment from a book to a song.\r\n\r\n**This is now fixed**: I added failing tests for the missing case and made them pass. However, the code is not the nicest. So, improvement suggestions welcome!",

    "body": "* A non-zero exit status allows subsequent shell commands to be chained\r\n  together such as: `rake db:reset test:prepare && rspec && cap deploy`\r\n  (if you're feeling brave :)\r\n* Any exceptions raised during the `create` and `drop` tasks are caught\r\n  in order to print a \"pretty\" message to the user. Unfortunately doing\r\n  so prevents rake from aborting with a non-zero exit status to the shell.\r\n* Therefore we re-raise the exceptions after the \"pretty\" message and\r\n  re-catch them in the task.\r\n* From the task we explicitly exit with a non-zero status. This method\r\n  was chosen (rather than just letting rake fail from the exception) so\r\n  that the backtrace is suppressed and the output to stderr is\r\n  unchanged.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\nThe idea is that any failing rake task should return a non-zero exit status for easy chain-able shell commands. This addresses failing `create` and `drop` tasks.\r\n\r\n## Observation\r\nBefore this change, the result of an example chain looks something like https://gist.github.com/iamvery/6978403. Notice, the inability to drop the database doesn't prevent `db:reset` from trying the rest of its sequence. Additionally, the chained `rspec` shell command tries to do its thing (ignore the bundle error).\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nAfter this change, the chain immediately exits with a status code \"1\". https://gist.github.com/iamvery/6978411. This not only prevents the task sequence from running its course, it also prevents any chained commands from executing in the shell.\r\n\r\n## Additional Information\r\n\r\n1. I opted to exit explicitly in the rescues so that the output format is not affected. Based on what I understand about `rake` this seems acceptable. Please advise if necessary.\r\n\r\n2. I was hesitant to submit a PR without tests, but the test suite appears to be unaffected by this change. I believe that is due to them covering \"happy paths\". If additional work needs to be done, please let me know!\r\n\r\nThank you for entertaining my request! Let me know if I must give it more attention to make it acceptable :smile: ",
