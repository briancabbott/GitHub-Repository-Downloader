# Listing community SDKs in the GitHub Docs

On the "Libraries" [page][1] in the API docs, we link out to GitHub's official Octokit SDKs and unofficial SDKs owned by the community.

The community can submit libraries for listing on the page by creating an issue or submitting a PR to [github/docs][2].

## Listing criteria

We will only consider listing community-owned SDKs which:

* The SDK has basic functionallity and works[^1] 
* The SDK is distributed with an open-source license which allows others to use, change and distribute the software
* The SDK repo includes basic documentation on setting up and using the library

Bonus aspects include (but are not limited to):
* Authentication
* Throttling
* Pagination
* Error Handling
* Caching

New submissions will be checked to make sure they meet these requirements, and we will periodically run checks to make sure that libraries that have already been listed continue to meet them.

We reserve the right to changes these criteria at any time.

:heart: Thank you for continuing to make our comunity better :heart:
