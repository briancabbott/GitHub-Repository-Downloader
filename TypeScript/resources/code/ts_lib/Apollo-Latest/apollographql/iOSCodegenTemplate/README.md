# iOS Codegen Template

This is the template for using Swift-based scripting to generate iOS code. Please see our full instructions at [https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/swift-scripting/](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/swift-scripting/).

### Note: 
If you're looking for sample code using the latest 0.x version of apollo-ios use the [`main`](https://github.com/apollographql/iOSCodegenTemplate) branch. For sample code linked with the 1.0 beta releases, use the [`release/1.0`](https://github.com/apollographql/iOSCodegenTemplate/tree/release/1.0) branch.
