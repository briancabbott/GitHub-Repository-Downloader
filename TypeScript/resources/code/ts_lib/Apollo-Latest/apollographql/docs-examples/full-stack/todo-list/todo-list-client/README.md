# To-do list example client

This sample demonstrates a basic to-do list frontend using Apollo Client. It uses the server in `todo-list-server` as its backend.

## Run locally

If you're running this sample locally _and_ you want it to communicate with a local version of `todo-list-server` (instead of the version hosted in Codesandbox), you need to update the value of `serverURL` in `src/index.js`. (See the comment near the top of the file.)

```shell
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Run in CodeSandbox
