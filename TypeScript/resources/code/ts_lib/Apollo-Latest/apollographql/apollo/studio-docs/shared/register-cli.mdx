1. If you haven't yet:
    *  <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/getting-started/" target="_blank">Install the Rover CLI.</a>
    * <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/configuring/" target="_blank">Authenticate Rover</a> with Apollo Studio.

3. Decide how you'll provide your server's schema to Rover. You can either:

    * Use a `.gql` or `.graphql` file saved on your local machine, or
    * Perform an introspection query on your running server to fetch the schema

4. Run the `rover graph publish` command, providing your schema in one of the ways shown:

    ```bash
    # Provide a local .graphql file path
    rover graph publish my-graph@my-variant --schema ./schema.graphql

    # Provide an introspection result via stdin
    rover graph introspect http://localhost:4000 | rover graph publish my-graph@my-variant --schema -
    ```

    As shown, the first positional argument you provide `rover graph publish` is a [graph ref](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/conventions/#graph-refs), a string that specifies a particular variant of a particular graph in Studio.
