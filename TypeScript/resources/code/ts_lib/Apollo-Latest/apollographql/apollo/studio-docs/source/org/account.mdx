## Creating your account

To create your Apollo user account, visit [studio.apollographql.com](https://studio.apollographql.com) and click **Create an account**. You can sign
up either with an email and password, or with an existing GitHub account.

If you sign up with GitHub, Studio uses your GitHub identity only for
login verification purposes. It does not request access to any of your GitHub
data.

>Single sign-on (SSO) account management via SAML or OIDC is available for [Enterprise customers](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing/).

Unless another Studio user has invited you to join an existing organization,
you will also be asked to [create an organization](./organizations/) as part of the signup process.

## Personal API keys

You can create API keys for your user account on your [Personal Settings page](https://studio.apollographql.com/user-settings).
User keys can be useful when configuring the Apollo CLI and VS Code extension; with a single key, you can pull data from all your graphs and organizations in Studio.

## Deleting your account

You can delete your user account at any time on your [Personal Settings page](https://studio.apollographql.com/user-settings).
