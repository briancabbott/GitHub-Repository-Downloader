about: Have a feature that you think is important? Help us understand it.

<!--

- Prior to opening a feature request, please search for existing requests.

  If you find an existing feature that matches your needs, use the 👍 emote
  to show your support for it. If the specifics of your use case are not
  covered in the existing feature request but the idea seems similar enough,
  please take the time to *add new conversation* which helps the feature's
  design evolve.

- If you do not find any other existing requests for the feature you desire,
  you should open a new feature request. Please take the time to help us
  understand your use-case as precisely as possible. Be sure to demonstrate
  that you've evaluated existing features and found them unsuitable.

  Be flexible in your design and consider slight variations which might
  necessitate a specific API design.  We also hope you'll be willing to engage
  in the on-going design discussion, prior to opening a pull-request.
