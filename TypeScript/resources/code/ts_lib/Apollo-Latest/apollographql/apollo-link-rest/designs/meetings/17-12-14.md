- Launch plan: Target date (first week of the new year)
- Future (v1.0)
  - What's our (REST-response) typechecking story?
  - Start thinking of best practices (query components vs. HOC)
    - Query components are very tempting for people trying to migrate, but schema-stitching & GraphQL fragments are valuable GraphQL features that a naïve implementation of query-components would fail to support. We don't want people "learning" GraphQL using Apollo-link-rest, but avoiding these features. [Frederic will be prototyping some query-components with fragment support in the next few weeks]

- Organisation
  - Who is willing to maintain/contribute on this project ?
- Code Process
  - Continue iterating quickly, with PRs opened for major changes, but don't let one's self get blocked. -- It's fine if a PR is only open for a few hours, or it gets rapidly merged.
  - Do prioritize small PRs
  - All attendees & Apollo are happy to provide code-reviews & should be tagged in if more feedback is needed.
