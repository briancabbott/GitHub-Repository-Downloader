# Apollo Open Source Renovate Configuration

This is a [Renovate](https://renovateapp.com/) configuration which is used by
Apollo Open Source repositories.

For example, the following repositories inherit from this configuration, rather
than maintaining their own.

* `apollo-server`
* `apollo-tooling`
* `apollo-client`
* `federation`
