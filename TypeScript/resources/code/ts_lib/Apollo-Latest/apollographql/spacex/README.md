This graph is a recreation of the [SpaceXLand/api](https://github.com/SpaceXLand/api) project that was authored by [Carlos Rufo](https://github.com/itscarlosrufo). The code for this recreation is open source and can be viewed [here](https://github.com/apollographql/spacex).

The original project used a MongoDB that was deprecated in favor of Launch Library 2; you can read about the issue [here](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/issues/1243). The team plans to keep the REST API in place but unmaintained. This project utilized the REST API to implement the same schema, but there are some gaps that have been marked `@deprecated`. For example, `Missions` are not available in the REST API.

You can try querying this graph using [Explorer](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/spacex-l4uc6p/explorer?variant=main).

## What this graph is all about

Open Source GraphQL API for launch, rocket, core, capsule, starlink, launchpad, and landing pad data possibly by a community effort from [r-spacex](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API).

This graph is meant for exploring historical SpaceX data. Any current space launch information can be found through [The Space Dev's Launch Library v2 (LLv2) effort](https://ll.thespacedevs.com/docs/). If you are interested in this effort, there are a couple ways you can get active in it:

1. Join [The Space Dev's Discord Server](https://discord.gg/p7ntkNA) to receive the latest updates
2. The Apollo DevRel team started up an [open sourced repository](https://github.com/apollographql/Space-Devs/issues) to create a GraphQL API for the LLv2. 
  a. You can query the data of this graph [here](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/space-devs/home?variant=main)
3. Join the [Apollo Discord Server](https://discord.gg/graphos) and we can help get you plugged in.
