| What's new | |
| :--------- | :-: |
| The Fields page can now display how many operations textually reference fields in addition to how many times the fields are executed. This can reveal connections hidden by field executions alone, and it enables you to use the page with federated graphs even if your subgraphs do not all support federated tracing. This new feature requires Apollo Server 3.6 or later. For details, see [the Fields page docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/metrics/field-usage/).| ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16724/147708671-6b6d15e3-80ce-411f-996f-b8f3d09b1046.jpeg) |

## 2021-03-04
| Security Upgrade |
| :--------------- |
| We have made a change to the way you use API keys with Studio: API keys are no longer be visible in plain text in your Graph and User Settings pages. You will only be able to see your API key secret in the moment that you first create it in Studio. This is security change we have made to reduce the probability of keys being accidentally leaked from our system. If you need to recover a token you have previously created, you can request help from us at support@apollographql.com. We recommend you just make a new token though. All existing keys will continue to work as-is, and no action is necessary as part of this change. |

| What's new | |
| :--------- | :-: |
| We added a feature to introduce Dev Graphs. If you have opened a Dev Graph recently you may see an informative popup! | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14367451/108418344-f6620300-71e5-11eb-804c-229cf2793651.png) |

| What's new |
| :--------- |
| We make a performance improvement to the Operations page; it should no longer slow down dramatically and/or become unresponsive when your graph has a very large number of clients. |

## 2021-02-15
| What's new |
| :--------- |
| üö• We shipped a small change to how Development Graphs poll their status so that they‚Äôre no longer polling for connectivity status on the Graph List page. When you're using a Dev Graph, you can also turn off its polling with the controls in the global nav. |

| Defer loading of some data to making initial render of graph list faster | ![Screen Recording 2021-02-15 at 06 55 15 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5922187/108012921-680c3800-6fbf-11eb-9707-c9ec5adeb5d0.gif) |

| Security Upgrade |
| :--------- |
| We are upgrading our minimum TLS version to 1.2 for communications with our APIs. This is being done as 1.1 has largely been deprecated industry wide for some time now, and our client's security is a top concern for us. For more information, please see our [StatusPage maintenance notice here](https://status.apollographql.com/incidents/chgzx4ppw5z9) |

| You can now turn on a setting in the Explorer to inline the timings from your traces next to your operation's fields when you run your operation. | <img width="1254" alt="Screen Shot 2021-01-28 at 6 34 12 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6856868/106212069-c9e33a00-6197-11eb-844f-a663c64881b8.png"> |

| :--------- |
| We've added **Schema Change Webhooks** ![webhooks icon](https://studio-staging.apollographql.com/icons/webhook.svg) for our Enterprise customers! We also updated Studio to remove the *Integrations* section and integrate it into *Settings*.<ul><li>You can now find Datadog settings under *Settings > General*.</li><li>Notification integrations including PagerDuty, Slack, and now Webhooks for Enterprise customers can be found under *Settings > Notifications*.</li><li>To setup a webhook for schema changes click *Add Notification*, select *Schema Change*, select the Variant you're interested in, *Create new channel*, *Webhook*.</li><li>Schema Change Webhooks will contain a string description of the schema change as well as a temporary URL which you can use to fetch the full updated schema. This link remains active for 24 hours.</li><li>See our updated [documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/notification-setup/#custom-webhooks-enterprise-only) for more information, and [let us know](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-studio-community/issues/new) if you have any feedback - or interesting integrations - to share!</li>|

| The Recent Checks page has a new treatment of implementing services, along with clearer indications of the case when the "branch" or "author" is left un-set. Check it out! | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6365997/106220710-f051a700-6190-11eb-9115-394109288864.png) |

| üêõ Bug fix |
| :--------- |
| We have fixed a **(very)** long-standing bug with our GitHub logins. Previously, if you changed your GitHub username and tried to log in to Studio again, you‚Äôd end up with a brand new unrelated account. (Also if your username was somebody else‚Äôs ‚Äúold username‚Äù who had logged in to Studio from GH with that username, you were locked out of using Studio entirely.) We‚Äôve fixed this: you can change your GitHub username as much as you want and you can still log in.|

| The graph gelector dropdown in the top nav now extracts your **favorites** and **current graph** to the top of the options list. | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5922187/106041335-8520ab80-6090-11eb-9756-0cdc421e11a5.png) |

| In federated graphs, you can now see which subgraph(s) each field in your operations comes from in the Explorer. | <img width="1359" alt="Screen Shot 2021-01-25 at 2 49 16 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5922187/105948444-ccbb1f00-601f-11eb-9147-8cc840972db6.png"> |
| Headers in the Explorer are now managed using input fields, instead of JSON :) | <img width="492" alt="Screen Shot 2021-01-25 at 6 13 11 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5922187/105948442-cb89f200-601f-11eb-867e-e740ecc83470.png"> |

| We've enhanced the [user roles system](https://apollographql.com/docs/studio/org/members/) available to Enterprise customers! <ul><li>Users can be granted a **role on a specific graph** with more permissions than their organization-level role.</li><li>A graph can be **hidden** from non-Organization Admin users that have not been explicitly granted a role on that graph.</li><li>Each [**graph API key**](https://apollographql.com/docs/studio/api-keys/#setting-permissions) now has a role (Graph Admin, Contributor, Observer, or Consumer) which limits their permissions. (Existing graph API keys retain their existing permissions.)</li><li>A new **Graph Admin** role has complete control over graphs (including managing graph-specific roles) but no organization-level administrative permissions. Existing Contributors have been changed to this role.</li><li>The Contributor role now is very similar to the Observer role, plus the ability to push new versions of the graph's schema. You can now mark individual variants as **protected**; you need to be a **Graph Admin** to push schemas to these variants.</li></ul> | <img width="600" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16724/105080845-406c9300-5a46-11eb-8c22-94122e4a5a93.png"> |

| You can now hard delete organizations on your organization's **Settings** page. Previously, you needed to contact Apollo support to do this. When you hard delete an organization, the following things will happen:<ul><li>If your organization is on a Team plan or Team trial, your subscription willl be immediately canceled. We can't issue refunds for this unfortunately.</li><li>All users memberships in your organization will be removed. Users of your organization will maintain their user accounts, but they will no longer be members of your org.</li><li>All graphs in your organization will be hard deleted. To keep your data secure, their graph IDs will be tombstoned and you will not be able to create new graphs with the same ID in the future.</li></ul>| <img width="600" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5922187/104364461-76040000-54cb-11eb-929f-7bf935128f39.png"> |

| We have transitioned our underlying support system at Apollo from **Intercom** to **Zendesk**. If you need to get in touch with us, please file a ticket with our new **Contact Support** form (available in the top right corner of the Studio UI). | <img width="400" alt="Screen Shot 2021-01-07 at 10 01 45 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5922187/103927585-70737800-50cf-11eb-9cae-8ba0003be642.png"> |

| We have updated the visual presentation of our Graphs list. Each graph is now represented as a card, we've added a settings link directly from the graph list, and we now represent links with blue to make them look more clickable. | <img width="960" alt="Screen Shot 2021-01-05 at 9 32 14 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5922187/103678896-fdd09400-4f38-11eb-92f3-6da406b14ee4.png"> |
