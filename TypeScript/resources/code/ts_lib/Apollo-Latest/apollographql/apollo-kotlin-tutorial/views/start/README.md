# Apollo Kotlin Tutorial (Views system)

Repository for the [Apollo Kotlin](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin) tutorial, using the [Android Views](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/declaring-layout) system. This directory is kept as reference but is not maintained anymore.

This is the starter project with the boilerplate and UI code already written but no Apollo Kotlin code.
