## Welcome

Large-scale graph operators use Kubernetes to run their Graph Router and Subgraph Services, with continuous app and service delivery.

Kubernetes provides a mature control-plane for deploying and operating your graph using container images like those produced by the [supergraph-demo](https://github.com/apollographql/supergraph-demo) `Source Repo`.

## Overview

This repo follows the [Declarative GitOps CD for Kubernetes Best Practices](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/best_practices/):

`Source Repo` - provides image tag versions via `Bump image versions` PR

* [apollographql/supergraph-demo](https://github.com/apollographql/supergraph-demo) produces the artifacts:
  * Subgraph docker images w/ embedded subgraph schemas
  * Supergraph-router docker image that can be fed a composed supergraph schema via
    * (a) Apollo Uplink - for update in place
    * (b) via a `ConfigMap` for declarative k8s config management
* Continuous integration:
  * Bumps package version numbers & container tags.
  * Builds/publishes container images to container registry.
  * `Bump image versions` PRs to propagate image version bumps to this repo.
    * see end of the [example artifact release workflow](https://github.com/apollographql/supergraph-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml)

`Graph Registry` - provides supergraph schema via `Bump supergraph schema` PR

* Graph schemas published to the Apollo Registry
  * Subgraphs publish their schema to the Apollo Registry after deployment.
  * Supergraph schema is published after Apollo Studio does:
    * Managed composition
    * Schema checks
    * Operation checks
    * No breaking changes are detected
  * Published supergraph schemas are made available via:
    * `Apollo Uplink` - that the Gateway can poll for live updates (default).
    * `Apollo Registry` - for retrieval via `rover supergraph fetch`.
    * `Apollo Build Webhook` - for triggering custom CD with the composed supergraph schema.
* `Bump supergraph schema` PRs are created by the [supergraph-build-webhook.yml workflow](https://github.com/apollographql/supergraph-demo-k8s-graphops/blob/main/.github/workflows/supergraph-build-webhook.yml) via:
  * Supergraph build webhook from Apollo Studio
  * Polling on a schedule in case a webhook is lost

`GraphOps Repo` (this repo) - declarative graph config for Kubernetes for GitOps

* Declarative k8s configs for `dev`, `stage`, and `prod`
  * [./clusters](https://github.com/apollographql/supergraph-demo-k8s-graph-ops/tree/main/clusters) - base cluster & GitOps config
  * [./infra](https://github.com/apollographql/supergraph-demo-k8s-graph-ops/tree/main/infra) - nginx, etc.
  * [./router](https://github.com/apollographql/supergraph-demo-k8s-graph-ops/tree/main/router) - supergraph router config
  * [./subgraphs](https://github.com/apollographql/supergraph-demo-k8s-graph-ops/tree/main/subgraphs) - products, inventory, users
* Promote config from `dev` -> `stage` -> `prod`
  * `make promote-dev-stage`
  * `make promote-stage-prod`
* Continuous deployment:
  * via GitOps operators like [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/) and [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/)
  * using progressive delivery controllers like [Argo Rollouts](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/) and [Flagger](https://flagger.app/)
  * or your favorite tools!

`kustomize` for k8s-native config management:

* [https://kustomize.io/](https://kustomize.io/)
* [kustomize helm example](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2-kustomize-helm-example)
* [multi-tenancy example](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2-multi-tenancy)
* [best-practices discussion thread](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux/issues/1071)

## Config Flow

Config data flows from the following sources:

* `Source Repo`:
  * `Bump image versions` PR is opened on the `GraphOps Repo`:
    * when new Gateway docker image versions are published:
      * see end of the [example artifact release workflow](https://github.com/apollographql/supergraph-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml)
      * bumps package versions in the `Source Repo`.
      * does an incremental monorepo build and pushes new docker images to DockerHub.
      * opens `GraphOps Repo` PR to bump the docker image versions in the `dev` environment (auto-merge).

* `Graph Registry`:
  * `Bump supergraph schema` PR is opened on the `GraphOps Repo`:
    * when Managed Federation sends a supergraph schema build webhook
      * `rover supergraph fetch` is used to retrieve the supergraph schema from the Apollo Registry.

* `GraphOps Repo`:
  * GraphOps team crafts the declarative configurations for each environment.
    * [./clusters](https://github.com/apollographql/supergraph-demo-k8s-graph-ops/tree/main/clusters) - base cluster & GitOps config
    * [./infra](https://github.com/apollographql/supergraph-demo-k8s-graph-ops/tree/main/infra) - nginx, etc.
    * [./router](https://github.com/apollographql/supergraph-demo-k8s-graph-ops/tree/main/router) - supergraph router config
    * [./subgraphs](https://github.com/apollographql/supergraph-demo-k8s-graph-ops/tree/main/subgraphs) - products, inventory, users
  * PRs for [docker image bumps](https://github.com/apollographql/supergraph-demo-k8s-graph-ops/pull/42) are (auto-)merged into the `GraphOps Repo`.
  * PR for [supergraph schema bumps](https://github.com/apollographql/supergraph-demo-k8s-graph-ops/pull/36) are (auto-)merged into the `GraphOps Repo`.
  * `GraphOps Repo` has definitive desired state for each environment.

Continous deployment of config data flows from the `GraphOps Repo` into the target k8s cluster:

* Via `kubectl apply -k` or GitOps tools like [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/kustomize/) or [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/docs/components/kustomize/)

* `kustomize` is used to generate parameterized config resources for each environment:
  * for example: [./router/dev/kustomization.yaml](https://github.com/apollographql/supergraph-demo-k8s-graph-ops/blob/main/router/dev/kustomization.yaml)
    * `configMapGenerator` supergraph.graphl schema
    * `images` with tag version bumps
* Progressive delivery controllers like [Argo Rollouts](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/) or [Flagger](https://flagger.app/) may also be used
  * `BlueGreen` and `Canary` deployment strategies
* `Rollback` via git commit & GitOps or progressive delivery controller [rollback](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/FAQ.html#how-does-bluegreen-rollback-work).

## Docker Images from Source Repo

New Gateway docker image versions are published as source changes are pushed to the main branch of the [supergraph-demo](https://github.com/apollographql/supergraph-demo) repo.

This is done by the [release.yml workflow](https://github.com/apollographql/supergraph-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml), which does an incremental matrix build and pushes new docker images to DockerHub, and then opens a `Bump image versions` PR in this repo that uses `kustomize edit set image` to inject the new image version tags into the [kustomization.yaml](https://github.com/apollographql/supergraph-demo-k8s-graphops/blob/main/router/dev/kustomization.yaml) for each environment.

![publish-artifacts-workflow](docs/media/publish-artifacts-workflow.png)

**Note: This workflow can be easily adapted for a single-repo-per-package scenarios, where they separately publish their own docker images and issue separate version bump PRs to this `GraphOps Repo`.**

## Supergraph Schemas from Graph Registry

1. Detecting changes to the supergraph built via Managed Federation

   * Managed Federation builds a supergraph schema after each `rover subgraph publish`
   * Changes detected with the following:
     * [Supergraph build webhooks](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/announcement/webhooks/) - when a new supergraph schema is built in Apollo Studio
     * `rover supergraph fetch` - to poll the Registry

2. `Bump supergraph schema` PR with auto-merge enabled when changes detected
   * Workflow: [supergraph-build-webhook.yml](https://github.com/apollographql/supergraph-demo-k8s-graphops/blob/main/.github/workflows/supergraph-build-webhook.yml)
   * Commits a new supergraph.graphql to the `GraphOps Repo` with the new version from Apollo Studio
   * Additional CI checks on the supergraph schema are required for the PR to merge
   * Auto-merged when CI checks pass

3. Generate a new Gateway `Deployment` and `ConfigMap` using `kustomize`
   * Once changes to `supergraph.graphql` when `Bump supergraph schema` is merged

### Using the Supergraph Build Webhook

1. Register the webhook in Apollo Studio in your graph settings
   * Send the webhook to an automation service or serverless function:
   * ![webhook-register](docs/media/webhook-register.png)

2. Adapt the webhook to a GitHub `repository_dispatch` POST request
   * Create a webhook proxy that passes a `repo` scoped personal access token (PAT)
   * Using a [GitHub machine account](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/blob/main/docs/concepts-guidelines.md#workarounds-to-trigger-further-workflow-runs) with limited access:
   * ![webhook-proxy](docs/media/webhook-proxy.png)

3. `repository_dispatch` event triggers a GitHub workflow
   * [supergraph-build-webhook.yml](https://github.com/apollographql/supergraph-demo-k8s-graphops/blob/main/.github/workflows/supergraph-build-webhook.yml)
   * uses both `repository_dispatch` and `scheduled` to catch any lost webhooks:
   * ![repository_dispatch](docs/media/repository-dispatch-triggered.png)

4. GitHub workflow automatically creates a PR with auto-merge enabled
   * [supergraph-build-webhook.yml](https://github.com/apollographql/supergraph-demo-k8s-graphops/blob/main/.github/workflows/supergraph-build-webhook.yml)
   * using a GitHub action like [Create Pull Request](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/create-pull-request) - see [concepts & guidelines](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/blob/main/docs/concepts-guidelines.md)
   * ![pr-created](docs/media/supergraph-pr-automerged.png)

## Deploy a Kubernetes Dev Environment

You'll need:

* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) - with expanded `kustomize` support for `resources`
* [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation)

then run:

```sh
make demo
```

which runs:
```sh
make k8s-up-dev
```

which creates:

* local k8s cluster with the NGINX Ingress Controller
* graph-router `Deployment` configured to use a supergraph `ConfigMap`
* graph-router `Service` and `Ingress`

and applies the following:

```
kubectl apply -k infra/dev
kubectl apply -k subgraphs/dev
kubectl apply -k router/dev
```

### Gateway Deployment with ConfigMap

### Cleanup

`make demo` then cleans up:

```
deployment.apps "graph-router" deleted
service "graphql-service" deleted
ingress.networking.k8s.io "graphql-ingress" deleted
Deleting cluster "kind" ...
```

## Promoting to Stage and Prod

Promoting configs from from dev -> stage -> prod can be as simple as:

1. copying the config from one environment to the next
   * `make promote-dev-stage`
   * `make promote-stage-prod`
1. push the changes

The GitOps operator in each Kubernetes cluster will pull the environment configuration from this `GraphOps Repo` and any changes will be applied to that cluster.

## GitOps

CD via GitOps:

* via GitOps operators like [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/) and [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/)

We'll use `flux` v2 for this example, so you'll need:

* [flux](https://fluxcd.io/docs/cmd/)

then run:

```sh
make demo-flux
```

which runs:

```sh
make k8s-up-flux-dev
```

which shows something like:

```
.scripts/k8s-up-flux.sh dev
Using dev/kustomization.yaml
kind version 0.11.1
No kind clusters found.

+ kind create cluster --image kindest/node:v1.21.1 --config=clusters/kind-cluster.yaml --wait 5m

```

the router ingress config needs the nginx ingress controller, so you'll see this while the nginx ingress admission controller is starting, but with GitOps and `flux` the configuration will be re-applied so will self-heal once it's started:

```
✗ apply failed: Error from server (InternalError): error when creating "3a946b48-8ea1-4516-8dcf-7341332f4d88.yaml": Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "validate.nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io": Post "https://ingress-nginx-controller-admission.ingress-nginx.svc:443/networking/v1beta1/ingresses?timeout=10s": dial tcp 10.96.26.139:443: i/o timeout
```

then smoke tests will run while the nginx ingress admission controller is starting, with the initial tests failing while the nginx admission controller is starting:

```

```

then finally the kind cluster will be deleted:

```
.scripts/k8s-down.sh
Deleting cluster "kind" ...
```

## Progressive Delivery

* using progressive delivery controllers like [Argo Rollouts](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/) and [Flagger](https://flagger.app/)
* or your favorite tools!

See the `BlueGreen` example below with more advanced examples coming soon!

### BlueGreen Deploys with Argo Rollouts

We'll use [Argo Rollouts](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/features/bluegreen/) to do a basic `BlueGreen` deployment in this example.

#### Initial Deployment

```
make k8s-up-flux-bluegreen
```

which does does a `BlueGreen` deploy of the subgraphs using `GitOps` and [subgraphs/dev-bluegreen/kustomization.yaml](subgraphs/dev-bluegreen/kustomization.yaml)

and shows the following:

```
.scripts/k8s-up-flux.sh dev bluegreen
Using Kustomizations:
- infra/dev/kustomization.yaml
- subgraphs/dev-bluegreen/kustomization.yaml
- router/dev/kustomization.yaml
kind version 0.11.1
No kind clusters found.
Creating cluster "kind" ...
 ✓ Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.21.1) 🖼
 ✓ Preparing nodes 📦
 ✓ Writing configuration 📜
 ✓ Starting control-plane 🕹️
 ✓ Installing CNI 🔌
 ✓ Installing StorageClass 💾
 ✓ Waiting ≤ 5m0s for control-plane = Ready ⏳
 • Ready after 28s 💚
Set kubectl context to "kind-kind"
You can now use your cluster with:

kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kind

Thanks for using kind! 😊

#### Verify Initial Deployment

you can then run:

```
make smoke
```

which shows the following:

using these `Rollouts`:

```
kubectl get rollouts

#### Make a Change to the Products Subgraph

Pushing a subgraph change to the products subgraph in the [supergraph-demo](https://github.com/apollographql/supergraph-demo/commit/7eab92087c204e2fdd0f9fc500113fc242b9a1a3) results in:

* [new products docker image](https://github.com/apollographql/supergraph-demo/commit/9ed8f92acf766af036fb3107de9f67999bf9c475) being pushed
* an associated [config repo PR](https://github.com/apollographql/supergraph-demo-k8s-graph-ops/commit/b4e5b385ac6ddb145cf2f95f77bda678997c75e4) being landed in [supergraph-demo-k8s-graph-ops](https://github.com/apollographql/supergraph-demo-k8s-graph-ops)
* Flux GitOps controller picks up the new config repo commit:

```
kubectl get kustomization
NAME        READY   STATUS                                                            AGE
infra       True    Applied revision: main/b4e5b385ac6ddb145cf2f95f77bda678997c75e4   78m
router      True    Applied revision: main/b4e5b385ac6ddb145cf2f95f77bda678997c75e4   78m
subgraphs   True    Applied revision: main/b4e5b385ac6ddb145cf2f95f77bda678997c75e4   78m
```

#### Preview Deployment Created

* the Argo Rollouts controller then deploys a new bluegreen deployment and makes it available via the [product preview-service](subgraphs/bluegreen/preview-services.yaml).

Which shows the following:

```
kubectl get rollouts
NAME                  DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE
inventory-bluegreen   1         1         1            1
products-bluegreen    1         2         1            1
users-bluegreen       1         1         1            1

kubectl get pods
NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/inventory-bluegreen-59d479fc9f-57fqw   1/1     Running   0          78m

pod/products-bluegreen-6fb56d84ff-k2jks    1/1     Running   0          67m
pod/router-deployment-588b77bc9b-k9gz5     1/1     Running   0          78m
pod/users-bluegreen-6b789d8cb7-wrxt7       1/1     Running   0          78m
```

#### Promote Preview Deployment to Active

Since we've set the [product subgraph rollout](subgraphs/bluegreen/subgraph-rollout.yaml) to have:

```yaml
 # Rollouts can be resumed using: `kubectl argo rollouts promote ROLLOUT`
      autoPromotionEnabled: false
```

we can install and use the [Argo Rollouts Kubectl Plugin](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/installation/#kubectl-plugin-installation) to manually promote the `BlueGreen` deployment for the product service:

```
kubectl argo rollouts promote products-bluegreen
rollout 'products-bluegreen' promoted
```

which results in the `preview` products deployment becoming `active` and the previous `active` deployment being decomissioned, resulting in one `active` pod and replicaset for the products subgraph.

```
kubectl get rollouts
NAME                  DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE
inventory-bluegreen   1         1         1            1
products-bluegreen    1         1         1            1
users-bluegreen       1         1         1            1
```

and

```
kubectl get pods
NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/inventory-bluegreen-59d479fc9f-57fqw   1/1     Running   0          80m
pod/products-bluegreen-6fb56d84ff-k2jks    1/1     Running   0          69m
pod/router-deployment-588b77bc9b-k9gz5     1/1     Running   0          80m
pod/users-bluegreen-6b789d8cb7-wrxt7       1/1     Running   0          80m
```

#### Verify new Active Deployment

```
make smoke
```

which shows:

```
