## Overview

Collect custom metrics from your application with a few clicks and send it to Datadog. No need to write code, redeploy or restart your app.

- Enhance monitoring and expedite production debugging with Rookout's on-demand data collection
- Collect custom metrics ad-hoc from Rookout without the need for new instrumentation

**Note: Since this integration enables you to collect custom metrics, there may be billing implications based on the number of custom metrics collected. More information on custom metrics can be [found here][1].**

## Setup

### Installation

Rookout sends data to Datadog via the DogStatsD service available from the Datadog Agent.

1. Install the [Datadog Agent][2] and [Rookout][3]

2. Log into [Rookout shell's webapp][4]

3. In the right panel (Rules) click on the menu button

    ![Rule actions menu][5]

4. Click on _Create new template_ in order to edit a new rule template

    ![Create new template button][6]

5. Copy the Datadog Custom Metric rule template [available here][7] into the editor and replace the default rule template

    ![Datadog Custom Metric rule template][8]

6. Click the save icon to save the template

    ![Click Save Icon][9]

7. Add the newly created rule to any application as you would normally

### Configuration

You can configure the rule to use specific actions, every rule should contain these attributes in the `processing.operations` object:

```json
{
  "name": "dogstatsd",
  "action": "<ACTION>",
  "metric": "<METRIC_NAME>",
  "target": {
    "host": "<HOST_NAME>",
    "port": 8125
  }
}
```

Depending on the actions, it needs different additional attributes:

| Datadog Action |  Attributes |
|----------------|-------------|
|    increment   | value       |
|    decrement   | value       |
|      event     | title, text |
|      gauge     | value       |
|    histogram   | value       |
|     timing     | value       |
|  distribution  | value       |

For more information about these actions you can see [Dogstatsd documentation][10]

Any attribute must be formatted the following way to be accepted by our rule:

```json
"value": {
    "name": "calc",
    "path": "123"
}
```

```json
"value": {
    "name": "calc",
    "path": "\"string\""
}
```

## Data Collected

You can collect custom metrics and events by creating a Datadog output in your Rookout rule. Some commonly used patterns:

- Count the number of a times a method is invoked (increment)
- Document process started in DataDog (event)
- Record batch sizes (histogram)
