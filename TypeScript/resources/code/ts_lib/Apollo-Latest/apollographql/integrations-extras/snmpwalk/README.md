# Snmpwalk Integration

## Overview

Get metrics from SNMP walk service in real time to:

- Visualize and monitor SNMP walk states
- Be notified about SNMP walk failovers and events.

## Setup

The SNMP walk check is **NOT** included in the [Datadog Agent][1] package.

### Installation

If you are using Agent v6.8+ follow the instructions below to install the SNMP walk check on your host. See our dedicated Agent guide for [installing community integrations][2] to install checks with the [Agent prior v6.8][3] or the [Docker Agent][4]:

1. Install the [developer toolkit][5].
2. Clone the integrations-extras repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-extras.git.
   ```

3. Update your `ddev` config with the `integrations-extras/` path:

   ```shell
   ddev config set extras ./integrations-extras
   ```

4. To build the `snmpwalk` package, run:

   ```shell
   ddev -e release build snmpwalk
   ```

5. [Download and launch the Datadog Agent][6].
6. Run the following command to install the integrations wheel with the Agent:

   ```shell
   datadog-agent integration install -w <PATH_OF_SNMPWALK_ARTIFACT_>/<SNMPWALK_ARTIFACT_NAME>.whl
   ```

7. Configure your integration like [any other packaged integration][7].

### Configuration

1. Edit the `snmpwalk.d/conf.yaml` file in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][8] to start collecting your SNMP walk [metrics](#metrics). See the [sample snmpwalk.d/conf.yaml][9] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][10]

## Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][11] and look for `snmpwalk` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected

### Metrics

The SNMP walk check does not include any metrics.

### Events

The SNMP walk check does not include any events.

### Service Checks

**`snmpwalk.can_check`**

The check returns:

- `OK` if the check can collect metrics from `snmpwalk`.
- `CRITICAL` if check encounters an error when trying to collect metrics from `snmpwalk`.
