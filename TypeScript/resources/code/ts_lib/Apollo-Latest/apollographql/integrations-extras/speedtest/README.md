# Agent Check: Speedtest

## Overview

This check monitors [Speedtest][1] through the Datadog Agent.

## Setup

Follow the instructions below to install and configure this check for an Agent running on a host. For containerized environments, see the [Autodiscovery Integration Templates][2] for guidance on applying these instructions.

### Installation

To install the Speedtest check on your host:

1. Install the [developer toolkit](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/integrations/new_check_howto/#developer-toolkit) on any machine.
2. Run `ddev release build speedtest` to build the package.
3. [Download the Datadog Agent](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent).
4. Upload the build artifact to any host with an Agent and run `datadog-agent integration install -w path/to/speedtest/dist/<ARTIFACT_NAME>.whl`.

Note: For all hosts you need to also install [Speedtest CLI](https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli) on your host and accept the agreement as the Datadog Agent user (e.g. `sudo -u dd-agent speedtest`) prior to use.

### Configuration

1. Edit the `speedtest.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your Speedtest performance data. See the [sample speedtest.d/conf.yaml][3] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][4].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][5] and look for `speedtest` under the Checks section.
