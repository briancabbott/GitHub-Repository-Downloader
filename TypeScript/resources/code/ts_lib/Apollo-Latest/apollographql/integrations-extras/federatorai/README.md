# Federator.ai Integration

## Overview

[ProphetStor Federator.ai][1] is an AI-based solution that helps enterprise manage, optimize, auto-scale resources for any applications on Kubernetes. Using advanced machine learning algorithms to predict application workload, Federator.ai scales the right amount of resources at the right time for optimized application performance.

* AI-based workload prediction for Kafka or any applications
* Resource recommendation based on workload prediction, application, Kubernetes and other related metrics
* Automatic scaling of application containers through [Datadog Watermark Pod Autoscaler (WPA)][4]

With integration of ProphetStor Federator.ai, users can easily track the Kafka message production/consumption rate, as well as the prediction of message production rate from Federator.ai dashboard. Based on the prediction or message production rate, Federator.ai automatically scales Kafka consumer replicas to handle the workload. This can be visualized from Federator.ai dashboard where the recommended consumer replicas and the current number of consumer replicas are shown. Additionally, overall consumer lags as well as the average latency in the queue before a message is received by a consumer are also shown on the dashboard for better performance monitoring.

* **Recommended Replicas vs Current/Desired Replicas**
   - This timeseries graph shows the recommended replicas from the Federator.ai and the desired and current replicas in the system.

![dashboard_recommended_replicas][13]

* **Production vs Consumption vs Production Prediction**
   - This timeseries graph shows the Kafka message production rate and consumption rate and the production rate predicted by Federator.ai.

* **Kafka Consumer Lag**
   - This timeseries graph shows the sum of consumer lags from all partitions.

* **Consumer Queue Latency (msec)**
   - This timeseries graph shows the average latency of a message in the message queue before it is received by a consumer.

* **Deployment Memory Usage**
   - This timeseries graph shows the memory usage of consumers.

* **Deployment CPU Usage**
   - This timeseries graph shows the CPU usage of consumers.

## Setup

### Installation

1. Log in to OpenShift/Kubernetes cluster
2. Install the Federator.ai for OpenShift/Kubernetes by the following command

   ```shell
   $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containers-ai/federatorai-operator/datadog/deploy/install.sh |bash
   ```

   ```shell
   $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containers-ai/federatorai-operator/datadog/deploy/install.sh |bash
   Checking environment version...
   ...Passed
   Please input Federator.ai Operator tag: datadog
   Enter the namespace you want to install Federator.ai [default: federatorai]:
   .........
   (snipped)
   .........
   You can now access GUI through https://federatorai-dashboard-frontend-federatorai.apps.jc-ocp4.172-31-17-84.nip.io
   Default login credential is admin/admin

   Also, you can start to apply alamedascaler CR for the namespace you would like to monitor.
   Review administration guide for further details.
   ========================================

   .........
   Install Alameda successfully

   Downloaded YAML files are located under /tmp/install-op
   ```

3. Verify Federator.ai pods are running properly

   ```shell
   $ kubectl get pod -n federatorai
   ```
4. Log in to Federator.ai GUI, URL and login credential could be found in the output of Step 2.


### Configuration

1. A Datadog account is required for connecting and using Datadog. If you don't have an account, visit the [Datadog website][10] and sign up for a free trial account.

2. Log in to Datadog with your account and get an [API key and Application key][11] for using Datadog API.

3. Configure the Federator.ai Data-Adapter.
   - Download the Data-Adapter configuration script from Github.

   ```shell
   $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containers-ai/federatorai-operator/datadog/deploy/federatorai-setup-for-datadog.sh -O
   ```

   - Change the execution permission.

   ```shell
   $ chomd +x federatorai-setup-for-datadog.sh
   ```

   - Prepare .kubeconfig (sh -c "export KUBECONFIG=.kubeconfig; oc login <K8s_LOGIN_URL>") or use an existing one. For example:

   ```shell
   $ sh -c "export KUBECONFIG=.kubeconfig; oc login https://api.ocp4.example.com:6443"
   ```

   - Run the configuration script and follow the steps to fill in configuration parameters:

   ```shell
   $ ./federatorai-setup-for-datadog.sh -k .kubeconfig
   ```

   ```shell
   $ ./federatorai-setup-for-datadog.sh -k .kubeconfig
   You are connecting to cluster: https://api.jc-ocp4.172-31-17-84.nip.io:6443
