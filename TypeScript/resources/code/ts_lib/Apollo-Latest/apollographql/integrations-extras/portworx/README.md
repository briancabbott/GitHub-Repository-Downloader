# Portworx Integration

## Overview

Get metrics from Portworx service in real time to:

- Monitor health and performance of your Portworx Cluster
- Track disk usage, latency and throughput for Portworx volumes

## Setup

### Installation

If you are using Agent v6.8+ follow the instructions below to install the Portworx check on your host. See our dedicated Agent guide for [installing community integrations][1] to install checks with the [Agent prior to version 6.8][2] or the [Docker Agent][3]:

1. Install the [developer toolkit][4].
2. Clone the integrations-extras repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-extras.git.
   ```

3. Update your `ddev` config with the `integrations-extras/` path:

   ```shell
   ddev config set extras ./integrations-extras
   ```

4. To build the `portworx` package, run:

   ```shell
   ddev -e release build portworx
   ```

5. [Download and launch the Datadog Agent][5].
6. Run the following command to install the integrations wheel with the Agent:

   ```shell
   datadog-agent integration install -w <PATH_OF_PORTWORX_ARTIFACT_>/<PORTWORX_ARTIFACT_NAME>.whl
   ```

7. Configure your integration like [any other packaged integration][6].

### Configuration

1. Edit the `portworx.d/conf.yaml` file in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][7] to start collecting your Portworx [metrics](#metrics). See the [sample portworx.d/conf.yaml][8] for all available configuration options.

    ```yaml
    init_config:

    instances:
     # url of the metrics endpoint of prometheus
     - prometheus_endpoint: http://localhost:9001/metrics
    ```

2. [Restart the Agent][9]

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `info` subcommand][10], you should see something like the following:

## Compatibility

The Portworx check is compatible with Portworx 1.4.0 and possible earlier versions.

## Data Collected

### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][11] for a list of metrics provided by this integration.

### Events

The Portworx check does not include any events.

## Troubleshooting

### Agent cannot connect

```text
    portworx
    -------
      - instance #0 [ERROR]: "('Connection aborted.', error(111, 'Connection refused'))"
      - Collected 0 metrics, 0 events & 0 service check
```

Check that the `url` in `portworx.yaml` is correct.
