# Blue Matador Integration

## Overview

Blue Matador's Datadog integration allows you to send Blue Matador events to the event stream in Datadog.

You can use it to enhance your existing dashboards or to correlate with metrics you're collecting in Datadog.

For a full list of events and metrics that Blue Matador monitors and that you can import into Datadog, see their [monitors page][3].

## Setup

To get Blue Matador events into Datadog, use a [Datadog API key][4] to create a new notification method in Blue Matador.

**Note**: Already existing events are not imported into Datadog, but new events appear as they occur.

For detailed setup instructions, see [Blue Matador's dedicated Datadog documentation][5].
