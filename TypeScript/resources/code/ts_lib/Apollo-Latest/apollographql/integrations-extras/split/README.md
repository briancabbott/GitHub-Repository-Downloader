# Split

## Overview

[Split][1] is a platform for [controlled rollouts][2], helping businesses of all sizes deliver exceptional user experiences and mitigate risk by providing an easy, secure way to target features to customers.

- See feature changes in context by including Split changelogs in your event stream
- Correlate feature impact with application performance
- Avoid critical issues before they happen. Disable features proactively based on Datadog metrics and alerts

## Setup

- **In Datadog**: Create an API Key <span class="hidden-api-key">\${api_key}</span>

- **In Split**: Go to **Admin Settings** and click **Integrations** and navigate to the Marketplace. Click Add next to Datadog.<br/>
