## Setup

### Configuration

In order to activate the integration of Datadog within your Uptime account, go to [Alerting>Push Notifications][2] then choose Datadog as the provider type when adding a new push notifications profile.

The following describes the fields shown when configuring Datadog within your Uptime account:
shell
- Name: The reference name you desire to assign to your Datadog profile. It can assist you with organizing multiple provider profiles within your Uptime account.

- API key: <span class="hidden-api-key">\${api_key}</span>

- Application Key: <span class="app_key" data-name="uptime"></span>

Once you've configured your Datadog profile, you will need to assign the profile to a contact group located under Alerting>Contacts. The profile is assigned at the Push Notifications field within the contact group.

## Data Collected
