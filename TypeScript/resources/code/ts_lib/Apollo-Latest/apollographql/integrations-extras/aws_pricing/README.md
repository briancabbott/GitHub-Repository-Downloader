# Agent Check: AWS Pricing

## Overview

This check pulls pricing information [published by AWS][1] to make it easier to measure cost of resource utilization within Datadog.

## Setup

### Installation

The AWS Pricing check is not included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package, so you need to install it yourself using [the official community integration installation instructions][7].

### Configuration

1. Edit the `aws_pricing.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting AWS pricing data. See the sample [aws_pricing.d/conf.yaml][2] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][3].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][4] and look for `aws_pricing` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected

### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][6] for a list of metrics provided by this check.

### Service Checks

`aws_pricing.status`:

Returns `CRITICAL` if the Agent encounters an error when using the Boto3 pricing client to collect metrics.

Returns `WARNING` if a rate code was defined in `aws_pricing.d/conf.yaml` which couldn't be found using the Boto3 pricing client.

Returns `OK` if no errors were encountered and all desired service rate code pricing data was collected.

### Events

AWS Pricing does not include any events.
