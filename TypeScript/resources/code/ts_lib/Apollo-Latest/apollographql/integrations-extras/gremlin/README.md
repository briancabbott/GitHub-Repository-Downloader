# Gremlin Integration

## Overview

View, rerun, and halt Gremlin attacks directly from Datadog!

Pairing Gremlin with Datadog's [Events][1] is an effective way to add failure-testing context to your Datadog workflows.

- Overlay attack events on top of your dashboards to pinpoint exactly how and when Gremlin is impacting your metrics.
- Show, Rerun, and Halt Gremlin attacks from your Datadog [Event Stream][2]

## Setup

### Configuration

In order to activate this integration, you will need to pass your Datadog API key to Gremlin. This is done on the [Integrations Page][4], by clicking the **Add** button on the row for **Datadog**. You will be prompted for your **Datadog API key**. Once entered, the integration will be initialized!

- API key: <span class="hidden-api-key">\${api_key}</span>

You should now start seeing events from this integration in your [Event Stream][2].
