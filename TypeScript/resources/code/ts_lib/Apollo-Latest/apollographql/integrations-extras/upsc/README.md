# UPSC Stats Collector Integration

## Overview

Get metrics from UPSD service via UPSC in real time to:

- Visualize and monitor UPS battery health and states
- Be notified about UPS failovers and events.

## Setup

The UPSC check is **NOT** included in the [Datadog Agent][1] package.

### Installation

If you are using Agent v6.8+ follow the instructions below to install the UPSD check on your host. See our dedicated Agent guide for [installing community integrations][2] to install checks with the [Agent prior v6.8][3] or the [Docker Agent][4]:

1. Install the [developer toolkit][5].
2. Clone the integrations-extras repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-extras.git.
   ```

3. Update your `ddev` config with the `integrations-extras/` path:

   ```shell
   ddev config set extras ./integrations-extras
   ```

4. To build the `upsc` package, run:

   ```shell
   ddev -e release build upsc
   ```

5. [Download and launch the Datadog Agent][6].
6. Run the following command to install the integrations wheel with the Agent:

   ```shell
   datadog-agent integration install -w <PATH_OF_UPSC_ARTIFACT_>/<UPSC_ARTIFACT_NAME>.whl
   ```

7. Configure your integration like [any other packaged integration][7].

### Configuration

1. Edit the `upsc.d/conf.yaml` file in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][8] to start collecting your UPSC [metrics](#metric-collection). See the [sample upsc.d/conf.yaml][9] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][10]

## Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][11] and look for `upsc` under the Checks section.
