# LaunchDarkly Integration

## Overview

The Datadog-LaunchDarkly integration allows you to see the effects of your LaunchDarkly feature deployments on your customer's services or systems. For instance, if a deployed feature causes a service to slow down, you would be able to see the cause within Datadog.
