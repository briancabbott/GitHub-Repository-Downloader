# Ambassador Integration

## Overview

Get metrics from [Ambassador][1] in real time to:

- Visualize the performance of your microservices

- Understand the impact of new versions of your services as you use Ambassador to do a canary rollout

![snapshot][2]

## Setup

Enable DogStatsD on your Agent Daemonset, and set the following environment variable on your Ambassador pod:

```
name: STATSD_HOST
valueFrom:
  fieldRef:    
    fieldPath: status.hostIP
```

With this setup, StatsD metrics are sent to the IP of the host, which redirects traffic to the Agent port 8125.

See the [Ambassador documentation][5] for more information.
