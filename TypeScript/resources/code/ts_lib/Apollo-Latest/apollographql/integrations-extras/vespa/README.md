# Vespa Integration

## Overview

Gather metrics from your [Vespa][1] system in real time to:

- Visualize and monitor Vespa state and performance
- Alert on health and availability

## Setup

The Vespa check is not included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package.

### Installation

To install the check on your host:

1. Install the [developer toolkit][7] on any machine.
2. Run `ddev release build vespa` to build the package.
3. [Download the Datadog Agent][2].
4. Upload the build artifact to any host with an Agent and run:

   ```shell
   datadog-agent integration install -w path/to/vespa/dist/<ARTIFACT_NAME>.whl
   ```

### Configuration

To configure the Vespa check:

1. Create a `vespa.d/` folder in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][8].
2. Create a `conf.yaml` file in the `vespa.d/` folder previously created.
3. See the [sample vespa.d/conf.yaml][10] file and copy its content in the `conf.yaml` file.
4. Edit the `conf.yaml` file to configure the `consumer`, which decides the set of metrics forwarded by the check:
   - `consumer`: The consumer to collect metrics for, either `default` or a [custom consumer][9]
     from your Vespa application's services.xml.
5. [Restart the Agent][3].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][4] and look for `vespa` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected

### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][6] for a list of metrics provided by this check.

### Service Checks

**vespa.metrics_health**:<br>
Returns `CRITICAL` if there is no response from the Vespa [Node metrics API][11]. Returns `WARNING` if there is a
response from the Vespa [Node metrics API][11] but there was an error in processing, otherwise returns `OK`.

**vespa.process_health**:<br>
For each Vespa process, returns `CRITICAL` if the process seems to be down (the Vespa [Node metrics API][11] fails to connect to the process).
Returns `WARNING` if the process status is unknown (the Vespa [Node metrics API][11] can connect to the process, but
gets an error in the response), otherwise returns `OK`.

### Events

The Vespa integration does not include any events.
