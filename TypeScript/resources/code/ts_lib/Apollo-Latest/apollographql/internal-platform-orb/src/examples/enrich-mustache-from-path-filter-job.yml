  Our enrich-mustache-from-path-filter is meant to be a drop in replacement for path-filtering/filter
  BUT: meant to be used in a situation where EITHER you
  want an easy way to use the rest of this orb's enhance-mustache
  functionality OR find that Circle's official path-filtering orb
  doesn't work for your use case anymore.

  For example, Circle's path-filtering works great if you want to turn on or off
  currently defined workflows or part of a pipeline. But if you have
  a situation where you want to create many instances of the SAME
  jobs, this is much harder to keep DRY.

  If, for example, you have a dynamic configuration and for each
  folder modified you want to do the same job, but with different parameters
  depending on what folder.

  For example, you always want to do `gradle`, but sometimes you want to do
  gradle build microservice-a and sometimes you want to do gradle build microservice-b.

  Now, with path-filtering you would need to set up indidivdual pipeline parameters
  for each case and define seperate parts of the workflow, running using when statements.
  Except these workflows or jobs are almost always the same - you're just always running gradle!

  Instead, create a mustache template and let this job generate a pipeline based on the
  mustache variables your MAPPING block defines.

  If multiple mapping files match AND the last item is a JSON array, multiple matches will
  append. (Normal JSON scalars will overwrite in an undefined way).

  The following example depends on .circleci/continue-config.yml looking like so

  version: 2.1
  workflows:
    build-it:
      jobs:
        - do-gradle:
            task: "{{what-gradle-action}}"
        {{#build-docs}}
        - do-build-docs:
            name: {{.}}
        {{/build-docs}}
