  Helper command which will `halt` the entire execution of the running `job` if the job
  is running on a branch without a PR.

  Circle's "when" conditions are great, but you could use this as a pre-step in a workflow to avoid executing a job

parameters:
  do-when:
    type: string
    description: Value passed to "when" parameter on job. Useful to let job run even after a prior step failed
    default: on_success

steps:
  - run:
      name: Halt if not PR...
      command: |
        if [ -z $CIRCLE_PULL_REQUEST ]
        then
          circleci-agent step halt
        fi
      when: << parameters.do-when >>
