# Graph Traversal

## The Official Live Stream from the GraphQL Foundation

### Purpose
Graph Traversal aims to spread awareness about the GraphQL Foundation's work by featuring interviews, demos, and discussions with committee members and others from the broader ecosystem. We are exploring different methods of live streaming to promote various Foundation activities, such as GraphQLConf, TWiG, graphql.org, and the grants program.

### Tools
We currently use restream.io for live streaming, which enables us to simultaneously broadcast on YouTube, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Additional platforms can be added if necessary.
