# Glossary RFC

The GraphQL spec uses a lot of terminology, some of this terminology is
introduced implicitly, some is defined explicitly, but either way finding the
definition when you read a term in the spec can be challenging.

To address these challenges, we propose adding a glossary to the GraphQL spec.
This glossary will be in the form of an additional appendix at the end of the
GraphQL spec.

We may or may not enhance `spec-md` with glossary-specific features (for
example linking to definitions where terms are used, or displaying the
definition on hover in a tooltip). This is currently seen as a separate effort
since having a glossary is useful in itself, so we should concentrate for now
on the glossary definitions only.

This RFC is composed of this file (`rfcs/glossary/README.md`) which explains
the thought behind the glossary RFC, and the glossary file itself
([`rfcs/glossary/Appendix C -- Glossary.md`](./Appendix%20C%20--%20Glossary.md))
which should be suitable for moving directly into the `spec/` folder in order
to add the glossary to the spec.

The glossary is not yet complete, and PRs adding definitions to it (in
alphabetical order) are welcome.
