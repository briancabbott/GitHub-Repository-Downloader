# Working Group Template

This repository contains a template for creating working groups under the
GraphQL Foundation. To use this template you should:

- create a new repository from it
- remove this front-matter
- customize the text in this README
- fill out `(NAME)` in [notes/README.md](notes/README.md)
- update the [initial agenda](./agendas/2022/2022-XX-XX.md)
- once your initial meeting is scheduled:
  - rename the initial agenda into `YYYY-MM-DD.md` format
  - have operations schedule the meeting, and update the password in the agenda
  - fix other instances of `TBD` in the agenda
  - create a blank Google document with the same title as the agenda, make it
    publicly editable, and link it under "Live Notes"

In this README, items that need replacing are ALLCAPS and surrounded by
parenthesis. We've attempted to make as much of the text as possible generic so
that little customization will be needed.

# GraphQL (NAME) Working Group

This working group is a subcommittee of the
[GraphQL Working Group](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg) with the
following primary purpose:

> (MISSION STATEMENT)

Anyone in the public GraphQL community may attend a meeting of this
subcommittee, provided they first sign the
[Specification Membership Agreement](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/tree/main/membership)
or belong to an organization which has signed.

This repository holds [agendas](./agendas) and [notes](./notes) for all meetings
past and upcoming as well as [shared RFC documents](./rfcs). Anyone may edit an
upcoming event's agenda to _attend_ or _propose an agenda item_.

All meetings occur via video conference, however participating company offices
are welcome to host guests.

Meetings are typically scheduled (DETAILS OF MEETING SCHEDULE). Check the
[agendas](./agendas) for the exact date and time of upcoming meetings.

Keep track of future upcoming meetings by subscribing to the
[Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=bGludXhmb3VuZGF0aW9uLm9yZ19pazc5dDl1dWoycDMyaTNyMjAzZGd2NW1vOEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t)
or
[ical file](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/linuxfoundation.org_ik79t9uuj2p32i3r203dgv5mo8%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics).
(maintained in UTC because time zones are hard).

### Joining a meeting?

To request participation in an upcoming meeting, please send a pull request by
editing the relevant [meeting agenda](./agendas).

### Want to help us keep up?

We're always looking for volunteers to help take notes from the meetings, the
results of which are shared in [`notes/`](./notes). If you're interested in
taking notes, sign up for a meeting in [`agendas/`](./agendas) and indicate that
you're willing to be a note taker.

## Participation guidelines

Meetings with many participants, especially over video, can easily get hard to
follow or run off course. When we talk about issues we care about, it's easy to
get into heated debate. In order to respect everyone's time, and arrive to
worthwhile outcomes, this subcommittee follows the
["Participation guidelines" in the GraphQL Working Group](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/README.md#participation-guidelines);
a summary of which is:

- Participate
- Don't talk too much
- Volunteer to take notes
- Have an outcome in mind
- Contribute
- Choose your battles
- Champion alternatives
- Block progress as a last resort
- Be patient and persistent
