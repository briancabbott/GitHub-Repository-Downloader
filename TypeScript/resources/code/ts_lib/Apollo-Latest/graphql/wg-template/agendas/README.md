# Agendas

An agenda contains details of when a subcommittee meeting occurs, how to access
it, who will be attending and what the topics to be covered are.

Agendas files are always named in `YYYY-MM-DD.md` format, and should be located
in a folder representing the year.

To request participation in an upcoming meeting, please send a pull request by
editing the relevant meeting agenda.

After a meeting, notes should be uploaded to the reciprocal file in
[the notes folder](../notes).

Meetings are recorded, and they can be viewed on the GraphQL Foundation's
YouTube channel:

There may or may not be a playlist specifically for this subcommittee; if there
is one it can be found here:
