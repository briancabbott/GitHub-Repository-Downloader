title : Standard cost conversion overview
This article provides a process overview to help you set up and run a standard cost conversion . The steps listed are intended to be completed after you &apos;ve completed the prerequisites for a standard cost conversion .
- Inventory close before the conversion – The inventory close can be included as part of the conversion on the planned conversion date , or it can be performed as a separate step before the conversion .
# # 3 . Identify the items to convert to standard cost
# # 4 . Enter or calculate the pending standard cost for each item that is being converted
# # 5 . Check and resolve any issues for the items that are being converted
# # 6 . Change the status of the conversion record to Ready
- An inventory close was performed on a date that is one day before the transition start date . To make sure that the transition start date and inventory close date are correctly aligned , you can either change the transition start date to one day after an existing inventory close or perform an inventory close .
# # 7 . Back up the database before conversion
The backup lets you restore the database if errors are encountered during the conversion .
- The item model group for converted items is changed so that it reflects a new group that has a standard cost inventory model .
- The standard costs for the converted items have been enabled in the dedicated costing version .

title : Data import and export jobs
# Data import and export jobs
# # Data import / export process
Here are the steps to import or export data .
1 . Create an import or export job where you complete the following tasks :
- Define the project category .
- Identify the entities to import or export .
- Set the data format for the job .
- Sequence the entities , so that they are processed in logical groups and in an order that makes sense .
2 . Validate that the source data and target data are mapped correctly .
3 . Verify the security for your import or export job .
4 . Run the import or export job .
5 . Validate that the job ran as expected by reviewing the job history .
6 . Clean up the staging tables .
The remaining sections of this topic provide more details about each step of the process .
# # Create an import or export job
A data import or export job can be run one time or many times .
# # # Define the project category
# # # Identify the entities to import or export
# # # Set the data format for the job
# # # Sequence the entities
The execution unit , level in the execution unit , and sequence of an entity help control the order that the data is exported or imported in .
- Entities in different execution units are processed in parallel .
- In each execution unit , entities are processed in parallel if they have the same level .
- In each level , entities are processed according to their sequence number in that level .
- After one level has been processed , the next level is processed .
You might want to resequence your entities in the following situations :
Use can use the * * Sort by * * option to view the entity list in sequential order .
For import projects , you can choose to truncate records in the entities prior to import . This is useful if your records must be imported into a clean set of tables . This setting is off by default .
# # Validate that the source data and target data are mapped correctly
Mapping is a function that applies to both import and export jobs .
- In the context of an import job , mapping describes which columns in the source file become the columns in the staging table . Therefore , the system can determine which column data in the source file must be copied into which column of the staging table .
# # Verify the security for your import or export job
# # # Secure a job by roles and users
You can also restrict a job to specific users . When you secure a job by users instead of roles , there is more control if multiple users are assigned to a role .
# # # Secure a job by legal entity
# # Run the import or export job
# # Validate that the job ran as expected
The job history is available for troubleshooting and investigation on both import and export jobs . Historical job runs are organized by time ranges .
Each job run provides the following details :
- Execution details
- Execution log
Execution details show the state of each data entity that the job processed . Therefore , you can quickly find the following information :
- Which entities were processed
- For an entity , how many records were successfully processed , and how many failed
You can download the staging data in a file for export jobs , or you can download it as a package for import and export jobs .
From the execution details , you can also open the execution log .
# # Clean up the staging tables
You can also combine the options to further restrict the record set that is deleted .

title : Absence registration in Time and attendance
# Absence registration in Time and attendance
This topic describes the concepts for absence and explains how to handle absence in Time and attendance .
# # Absence that is based on regular work hours
Workers are considered absent for any hours that they don &apos;t work during their regular work hours . Regular work hours are defined in a worker &apos;s standard time profile .
In this case , workers are prompted to enter a reason for their absence . They can specify a reason by selecting an absence code .
Absence codes define the various types of absence . Absence codes are defined by the company .
You can set up automatic absence codes . These absence codes can be used to calculate a worker &apos;s time when no absence is registered . The worker &apos;s time profile determines whether the absence code for standard time or flex time is used .
# # # Set up standard time and flex time
# # # Set up planned absence
# # # Set up a planned absence for interruption
# # Examples of the use of absence in a flex profile
The following three examples show how absence is calculated in a profile that has flex periods .
The examples use the following profile .
# # # Example 2 : Signing out in during Standard time period
# # Absence in the calculation and approval process
An approver can change a worker &apos;s time registrations . The approver can even change any absence that the worker has registered . If the approver manually enters a time period that has an absence code , the absence code for that period isn &apos;t overridden by the default absence code from the Time and attendance parameters .
# # # Calculate and approve absence
title : Production order cost estimation
This article provides information about production cost estimation . Production cost estimation provides the projected material and capacity consumption costs of producing an item in the planned production order quantity .
After you create a production order , you must estimate production costs . The purpose is to estimate item and route consumption for the production process , because these estimates are used as the basis for subsequent scheduling and production processes .
Estimates of production costs are based on the following information :
- The quantity on the production order
- The components on the production bills of materials ( BOMs )
- The routing operations in the production route
- The active cost data as of the calculation date
# # View the estimated costs
# # Other uses of cost estimation
A cost estimate also provides the following information :
- Meaningful price quotations
- Estimates of the profitability of the order
- Estimates of raw material usage
- Comparisons of cost information from previous productions
- Budget and forecasting information
title : Nomenclature of product variant numbers and names
# Nomenclature of product variant numbers and names
# # Nomenclature of predefined product variants
Product variants are generated for product masters according to one of three configuration technologies :
- Predefined variants
- Product master number
- Product master name
- Number sequence value
- Text constant
- Configuration ID or name
- Color ID or name
- Size ID or name
- Style ID or name
1 . Product master number
2 . Text constant : &quot; - &quot;
4 . Text constant : &quot; - &quot;
6 . Text constant : &quot; - &quot;
In this case , the product variant number for a red , small , polo T-shirt will be TS1234-Red-Small-Polo .
- Attribute value
Each component in a product configuration model can have its own configuration nomenclature . Only attributes that belong to the component can be used . Attributes from subcomponents or user requirements can &apos;t be used .
A product configuration model has a root component that has two attributes :
You create a configuration nomenclature that has the following segments :
1 . Attribute value : Material
2 . Text constant : &quot; AAA &quot;
3 . Attribute value : Length
# # Nomenclature of dimension-based configurations
- Configuration group item
A BOM has four BOM lines that are divided into two configuration groups :
- BOM line : M0007 , Standard cabinet
- Configuration group : Cabinet
- BOM line : M0008 , High end cabinet
- BOM line : M0021 , Front grill cloth
- Configuration group : Front grill
- BOM line : M0022 , Front grill metal
1 . Configuration group : Cabinet
2 . Text constant : &quot; &amp; &quot;
# # Nomenclature for a combination of product variants and configurations
When you use either the constraint-based configuration technology or the dimension-based configuration technology to configure product variants for a product master , the product variant numbers of the product variants can include the nomenclature from the configuration dimension . Follow these steps to configure variants .
2 . Assign the nomenclature to a product dimension group that has the configuration dimension .
3 . Define a configuration nomenclature for the components or BOMs that will be used to configure the product variants .
You can also create nomenclatures for the product variant names . The product variant names can be configured to include the configuration ID or name .
# # # Example for constraint-based configurations
For this example , you use a product variant number nomenclature that consists of the following segments :
2 . Text constant &quot; \ _ &quot;
The configuration nomenclature consists of the following segments :
In this case , the product variant number will be M0099 \ _ PlasticAAA12 .
# # # Example for dimension-based configurations
2 . Text constant &quot; / / &quot;

This topic gives an overview of the production processes . It describes the various stages of production orders , batch orders , and kanbans , from order creation to closing of the financial period .
The choice of the cost measurement methods also defines the requirements for reporting about material and resource consumption during the production process . Typically , actual cost methods require accurate reporting on the job level , whereas periodic costing methods allow for less granular reporting of material and resource consumption .
To select the manufacturing principle that best applies to a particular product and related market , you must consider the requirements of production and logistics , and also customer expectations about delivery lead times .

- Both configuration keys can &apos;t be turned on at the same time .
The following sections describe some of the major improvements for the statement posting feature that appear in the user interface for retail statements and posted statements .
A new state model has been introduced in the statement posting routine across the calculation and posting processes .
The following table describes the various states and their order during the calculation process .
&#124; State order &#124; State &#124; Description &#124;
The following table describes the various states and their order during the posting process .
- The first section shows the current status of the statement , together with the error code and a detailed error message , if an error occurred .
Additionally , the header of the second and third sections shows the overall status of the relevant process .
The * * Sales order detail * * tab of an aggregated transaction shows the following information :
The aggregated transaction view provides the following benefits :
- The user has visibility into the aggregated transactions that failed during sales order creation and the sales orders that failed during invoicing .
- The user has visibility into how transactions are aggregated .
- Aggregated XML file make it easier to identify issues during sales order creation and invoicing .
Currently , the program shows this data only for posted statements .
Other , back-end improvements that users can see have been made to the statement posting feature . Here are some examples :
- Statements are efficiently queued for processing by prioritizing the statements that have the maximum number of transactions .
# # General guidance about the statement posting process
- We recommend that you run the statement posting process in a batch , because batch runs take advantage of the power of the batch framework in terms of multithreading . Multithreading is required in order to handle the huge volumes of transactions that are normally seen in statement postings .
- We recommend that you use aggregation while you calculate and post statements . Therefore , the following settings are recommended for some of the aggregation parameters :

title : Vendor invoice automation
This topic explains the features that are available for end-to-end automation of vendor invoices , even invoices that include attachments .
The solution footprint consists of the following components :
+ Data entities for the invoice header , invoice lines , and invoice attachments
+ A side-by-side attachment viewer in invoices
The rest of this topic provides detailed descriptions of these solution components .
+ Vendor invoice header
+ Vendor invoice line
+ Vendor invoice document attachment
Vendor invoice document attachment is a new data entity that is introduced as part of this feature . The Vendor invoice header entity has been modified so that it supports attachments . The Vendor invoice line entity hasn ’ t been modified for this feature .
To quickly generate test data that includes invoices and attachments , follow these steps .
1 . Create invoices that have lines and attachments .
&gt; The attachments must be header attachments . Currently , the Vendor invoice document attachment entity doesn ’ t support line attachments .
1 . Download the exported data as a package . You can now use the package to import data into target instances for testing purposes .
# # # Determining the legal entity for an invoice
Invoices that are imported via data packages can be associated with the legal entity that they belong to in two ways :
&gt; This behavior is standard data management behavior . It ’ s explained here , in the context of invoices , just for the sake of completeness .
# # # Exceptions list page
This list page includes the following fields that come in via the feed :
+ * * Company * * – The company that the invoice belongs to
+ * * Error message * * – The error message that the data management framework issues to explain why the invoice could not be created
+ * * Name * * – The vendor ’ s name
&gt; The line reference isn ’ t the invoice ID .
This list page also has a preview pane that you can used in the following ways :
+ View the whole list of attachments for the invoice , if any attachments came with the invoice .
The list page supports the following actions :
When you start edit mode , the exception details page for the invoice that has issues appears . If there are any attachments , the invoice and the default attachment appear side by side on the exception details page .
In the preceding illustration , there weren ’ t any lines for the vendor invoice header that came in . Therefore , the lines section is empty .
The exception details page supports the following operation :
# # # Shared service vs. organization-based exception processing
+ By user role
+ By legal entity
If security is configured for the invoice import job , the exceptions list page honors those settings . Users will be able to see only the invoice exception records that this setup allows them to see .
Contoso could also decide not to enforce any security , so that the same users can process invoice exceptions for all legal entities . This setup enables a shared services scenario for the management of invoice exceptions .
To help you easily view the attachments for vendor invoices , the following pages that are used in the invoicing process now provide an attachment viewer :
Here is the main functionality that the attachment viewer provides :
+ View multi-page TIFF files .
+ Perform the following actions on image files :
+ Highlight parts of the image .
+ Block parts of the image .
+ Zoom in and out on the image .
+ Pan the image .
+ Undo and redo actions .
+ Fit the image to size .
# # # Show / hide invoice attachments
The following actions in the attachment viewer are controlled via role-based security :
# # # Pending vendor invoices page
The following privileges provide ready-only access or read / write access to the attachment viewer for the highlighting , block , and annotation actions :
The following duties provide read-only access or read / write access to the attachment viewer for those actions :
# # # Invoice exception details page
&gt; Out of the box , the roles that are mentioned in this section provide read-only access to the invoice images in the attachment viewer . If a role must also have write access to the images , you can grant write access to that role by using the privilege and duty that are described here .
The following duties provide read-only access to the attachment viewer for those actions :
The following roles provide read-only access to the attachment viewer for those actions :

title : Quality management processes
This article provides information about the quality management process for nonconforming products . It describes how you can use quality control functionality , how to define and maintain nonconformances , and how to handle corrections .
# # Controlling the quality management process
Here are some of the ways that you can control the quality management process :
- Document test results , and determine whether the results meet the established test criteria and acceptable quality levels .
- Maintain nonconforming products , and correlate these products with additional nonconformance information to track down the original cause of a problem .
- Schedule error correction processes by using correction handling that is linked to quality orders .
# # Product testing and quality orders
Product testing is typically referred to as quality control and uses quality orders . By using the quality control functionality , you can do the following :
- Record the test results in a quality order , validate the test results against the AQL , and print a certificate of analysis that displays the test results .
The following table lists the six default nonconformance types and describes the information that must be recorded for each type .
&#124; Nonconformance type &#124; Source information &#124;
&#124; Co-product production &#124; A co-product production order nonconformance that is related to batch production orders . &#124;
You can optionally link one nonconformance to another and create a new nonconformance from an existing one . For example , the link can reflect the interconnection between quality problems .
The following table lists the pages that support the close Accounts receivable business process .
&gt; To open some of the pages in the table , you must enter information or specify parameter settings .

title : Mobile invoice approvals
Every organization orchestrates and defines its business process for vendor invoices differently . Before you design a mobile experience for vendor invoice approvals , you should consider the following aspects of the business process . The idea is to use these data points as much as possible to optimize the user experience on the device .
- What fields from the invoice header will the user want to see in the mobile experience , and in what order ?
- What fields from the invoice lines will the user want to see in the mobile experience , and in what order ?
- How many invoice lines are there in an invoice ? Apply the 80-20 rule here , and optimize for the 80 percent .
- Will users want to see accounting distributions ( invoice coding ) on the mobile device during reviews ? If the answer to this question is yes , consider the following questions :
- Do the invoices also have accounting distributions on the invoice header ? If so , should these accounting distributions be available on the device ?
&gt; This topic doesn ’ t explain how to edit accounting distributions , because this functionality isn ’ t currently supported for mobile scenarios .
The design of the mobile experience for invoice approvals will differ , depending on the answers to these questions . The objective is to optimize the user experience for the business process on mobile in an organization . In the rest of this topic , we will look at two scenario variations that are based on different answers to the preceding questions .
As a general guidance , when working with the mobile designer , make sure to &apos; publish &apos; the changes to prevent losing the updates .
# # Designing a simple invoice approval scenario for Contoso
# # # Create the workspace
6 . Select a workspace color . The workspace color will be used for the overall style of the mobile experience for this workspace .
7 . Select an icon for the workspace .
# # # Vendor invoices assigned to me
- Vendor name
- Invoice total
- Invoice number
- Invoice date
After the fields are added , the mobile page must resemble the following illustration .
9 . You must also add the following columns now , so that we can enable workflow actions later .
- Show complete task
- Show delegate task
- Show recall task
- Show reject task
- Show request completion task
9 . Add the following fields from the header , based on the requirements for this scenario :
- Invoice description
- Due date
- Invoice currency
10 . Add the following fields from the lines grid on the page :
- Procurement category
- Unit price
- Line net amount
- 1099 amount
12 . Repeat the previous steps to record all the required workflow actions .
- It hides the extra workflow-related columns that we added earlier on the mobile list page . We added these columns so that the app has that information in context and can do the next step .
- Based on the workflow step that is active , it applies logic to show only those actions .
&gt; The name of the pages and other controls in the code must be the same as the names in the workspace .
# # # Vendor invoice attachments
# # # Vendor invoice line distributions
3 . Ledger account
1 . Open the .js file that you created earlier , and add the lines that are highlighted in the following code . This code does two things :
- Drill into one of the invoices , and see the invoice header details and line details .
The following variations can be done for scenario 1 , based on the requirements for scenario 2 . You can use this section to improve your mobile app experience .
1 . Because more invoice lines are expected in scenario 2 , the following changes to the design will help optimize the user experience on the mobile device :

title : Movement of inventory with associated work in Warehouse management
# Movement of inventory with associated work in Warehouse management
The flexibility to manage the daily operations of warehouse workers can be useful in scenarios such as these :
A company has a relatively small receiving area , and it ’ s congested with pallets and boxes awaiting put away . A large shipment is expected on the current day , so the receiving clerk decides to clear up the receiving area by moving some of the pallets to a secondary inbound staging area .
The work reservations that you can move are limited to Sales order , Transfer order issue , Transfer order receipt , Purchase order , and Replenishment work .
Only the ad hoc movement is currently supported . That means that you will not be able to move reserved inventory through the movement by template mobile device menu items .

title : Replenishment with withdrawal kanbans
# # Workflow for material replenishment that uses the withdrawal kanban
The withdrawal kanban can be used to move a kanban of a single item between warehouses and production locations where the material is consumed . The withdrawal kanban supports a pull-based solution for material replenishment , where a pull signal is required in order to trigger supply for a specific demand .
The following scenario shows a pull-based replenishment system where a pull signal triggers the creation of a kanban to replenish material for a production process .
1 . Withdrawal kanban
2 . Kanban “ from ” location and put location for warehouse work
3 . Kanban “ to ” location and production input location
5 . Warehouse work for kanban picking
6 . Warehouse locations for raw material
7 . Material warehouse
# # Configure warehouse work for kanban picking for the withdrawal kanban
# # Configure the withdrawal kanban
# # Scenario 1 : Replenish a production input location by using a fixed withdrawal kanban
# # Scenario 2 : Automatically complete the transfer activity when kanban picking work is processed
In the following scenario , the transfer activity of the withdrawal kanban is configured to transfer between two locations in the same warehouse . The transfer activity of the withdrawal kanban is set up so that it ’ s completed automatically .

Immediate replenishment lets you replenish inventory immediately after a location directive line fails to allocate inventory . The replenishment is based on a single line in the setup of the location directive . If inventory isn &apos;t on hand in the unit of measure that is specified by that line , replenishment of that unit of measure occurs immediately .
Immediate replenishment provides an alternative to the method where the allocation of inventory is based on more lines in the location directive , and where the demand is summed at the end of the allocation and replenished in the unit of measure that is specified by the last line in the location directive .
The benefits of using immediate replenishment are that replenishment can be limited by specific units and the quantity can be directed to specific locations .
Immediate replenishment is used during wave execution if allocation fails for a location directive line that a replenishment template is set for .
# # Set up immediate replenishment
The replenishment template is applied if the location directive line fails to allocate a dedicated unit of measure .
If immediate replenishment is selected for a location directive line , but no replenishment work is generated when you use demand replenishment templates for that location directive line , two main causes must be investigated :
- Make sure that there is enough on-hand inventory at the locations where the demand replenishment template searches for on-hand inventory for replenishment .
title : Submit and approve project budget revision

title : Packing slip updates for returns
The packing slip update can be processed in either the item arrival journal or the return order .
As part of the process for posting packing slips , the packing slip reference number from the customer ’ s shipping documents can be associated with the order lines . This association is optional and for reference only . It does not create any transactional updates .
If not all of the expected return items have arrived , you should include only the quantity that has been received in the packing slip update . Leave the remaining items on the order until the rest of the return shipment has arrived .
If an item is sent back from quarantine to the Shipping and Receiving department , such as when the quarantine inspector does not know where to store the item in inventory , the corresponding packing slip must be updated to correctly register and act on the disposition code that is specified as a result of the quarantine .
When you update a packing slip for a returned item that is from a sales agreement , the sales agreement commitment for that item is automatically updated to reflect the change in the quantity or the amount .

title : Purchasing policies
This article provides information about purchasing policies . A purchasing policy is a collection of rules that control the requisition process . Purchasing policies help procurement administrators implement their procurement strategy by creating a policy structure that is aligned with the organization ’ s strategic purchasing requirements .
# # Assigning policies to organizations
# # Determining which rule to apply
Depending on how you configure your purchasing policies , multiple rules can affect the users in an organization . The following examples illustrate different ways that you can configure purchasing policies and specify how policies are applied when a transaction occurs .
# # # Example 1 : Simple purchasing policy configuration
Organizations that are small and less complex can set up purchasing policies by legal entity , and can use only the Companies organization hierarchy .
When an employee in legal entity 2222 creates a purchase requisition , the policy rules are derived from policy B .
In the previous example , all purchasing rules were defined in a single organization hierarchy , the Companies organization hierarchy . However , a complex organization might define policies for multiple organization hierarchies .
Contoso is a large company that requires complex purchasing rules to control the requisition process . Contoso has defined rules for two different organization hierarchies : Department and Global purchasing control .
1 . Global purchasing control
Therefore , policy 456 is applied to the purchase requisition that Sam creates , and no minimum order quantity is required for the purchase requisition .
# # # Catalog policy rule
# # # Category access policy rule
The category access policy rule determines which categories users have access to when they create purchase requisitions . If no rule is specified , all the procurement categories can be added to the purchase requisition .
# # # Category policy rule
The category policy rule defines how users can select vendors for each category . It also defines requirements for the receiving and invoicing processes .
The re-approval rule is an optional rule that defines the criteria for requiring re-approval when a purchase order is changed . The selected fields are evaluated in the purchase order workflow when the &quot; Requires purchase order re-approval &quot; condition is set up in the workflow .
# # # Purchase requisition RFQ rule
# # # Purchase requisition control rule
The purchase requisition control rule is an optional rule . When you create rules of this type , you can set options on various tabs :
# # # Requisition purpose rule
# # # Replenishment category access policy rule
The replenishment category access policy rile is an optional rule that determines the products that are available to fulfill requisition demand for a specific legal entity when the requisition purpose is * * Replenishment * * .
# # # Replenishment control rule
The replenishment control rule is an optional rule that defines the fields that must be entered on the requisition line for the requisition to be submitted for approval when the requisition purpose is * * Replenishment * * .
The purchase order creation and demand consolidation rule defines the policy rules to use when a purchase order is generated from an approved purchase requisition . When you create rules of this type , you can set options on various tabs :
# # Data flow in Prospect to cash
The following templates and underlying tasks are used to run synchronization of sales orders directly between Sales and Finance and Operations :
- * * Names of the templates in Data integration : * *
- * * Names of the tasks in the Data integration project : * *
The following synchronization tasks are required before synchronization of sales invoice headers and lines can occur :
In Finance and operations , filters in the template help guarantee that only the relevant sales orders are included in the synchronization :
# # Discount calculation and rounding
# # Prospect to cash solution for Sales
# # Preconditions and mapping setup
Before you synchronize sales orders , it &apos;s important that you update the following settings in the systems .
# # # Setup in Sales
# # # # SalesHeader task
# # # # SalesLine task
- Make sure that the required units are defined in Sales .
# # Template mapping in Data integration

# Organize your workforce by using departments , jobs , and positions
Departments , jobs , and positions are organizational elements that are maintained within Human resources . This topic describes conceptual information about these elements .
The following example is used to illustrate the concepts described in this topic .
&#124; Job &#124; Job function &#124;
&#124; Sales manager &#124; Mng-people – Manage people who report to you . &#124;
&#124; Accountant &#124; FIN-Review – Maintain financial data for a set of accounts . &#124;
- Hourly pay
# # # Areas of responsibility
# # # Position creation and maintenance
- You can create reason codes that your users can select when they create or modify positions .
- You can create personnel action types and assign a number sequence to personnel actions .
- You can set up workflow so that position additions and changes can require approval .
Every position has a length of time that the position is effective . This length of time is referred to as duration . For example , summer positions might have duration of May 1 , 2015 until August 31 , 2015 .
When you assign a worker to a position , you fill that position . You can assign workers to multiple positions , but only one worker can be assigned to a position at the same time .
For the previous example , you would complete the following tasks to set up the working relationship between Sanjay Patel and Lori Penor :
1 . Create a custom position hierarchy type called “ Widget ” to create a hierarchy that includes positions responsible for working on the widget cleaner product .
2 . Assign the General Manager position to be the position that the Accountant-A position reports to in the Widget hierarchy .
For some records , you can specify future changes to the record . The following information is date effective .
# Reduce the days on subscription fees
To reduce the number of days of an existing subscription fee , you can create a new transaction in which you remove the period of time that should no longer be part of the subscription fee interval .
# # Reduce the days on a subscription fee
This article provides an overview of the bonus depreciation functionality .
You can calculate bonus depreciation by using the proposal process , or you can create manual bonus depreciation transactions . You can &apos;t create bonus depreciation transactions if depreciation transactions or depreciation adjustment transactions exist for that asset book .
When you use the proposal process to calculate bonus depreciation , all existing bonus transactions are included in the calculation of the basis . The calculation also includes any previous bonus depreciations that you manually entered for the asset .
If more than one bonus depreciation will be taken for an asset , the priority is considered . Each bonus reduces the asset basis for the next bonus . Salvage value isn &apos;t considered in the asset basis for bonus depreciation calculations , and the depreciation convention doesn &apos;t apply for bonus depreciation .
The following bonus depreciations are associated with an asset book :
The asset acquisition cost is 5,000.00 . When bonus depreciation is calculated , the first bonus depreciation amount is 1,000.00 for the Section 179 depreciation .
Acquisition cost – 1,000 ( Section 179 depreciation ) × 30 percent = 1,200
If the bonus depreciation amount is more than the remaining acquisition cost , the bonus depreciation amount is either the result of the bonus depreciation calculation or the remaining acquisition cost , whichever amount is less .
If the remaining acquisition cost is 0 ( zero ) or less , bonus depreciation transactions isn &apos;t generated .
When bonus depreciation is calculated by using the proposal process , a bonus depreciation transaction is created for all applicable bonus depreciation records that are associated with the asset book .
You can create an unlimited number of bonus depreciation records . After you assign those records to the asset group book , they are applied to the asset book .
Bonus depreciation is entered as either a percentage or a fixed amount . When you post depreciation proposals , bonus depreciation transactions are posted to the book as separate transactions from the depreciation transactions .

title : Set up interest rates for an interest code
# Set up interest rates for an interest code
Interest codes contain settings that determine when interest is charged and how it is calculated on overdue accounts .
- Rates for interest earnings − These represent revenue that is earned by charging interest on invoices or interest notes .
- Rates for interest payments − These represent a cost that is paid for interest on credit notes .
Both of these rate types can exist at the same time and in the same interest code . Interest rates can be based on three calculation types :
- Interest by percentage .
- Interest by amount .
# # Interest rates based on a percentage
You can set up interest rates that calculate a specified percentage .
- Interest amount applies to all currencies .
- Optional interest amount limits can be entered .

title : Procurement catalogs
This article describes , at a high level , how purchasing professionals can set up and maintain procurement catalogs . Procurement catalogs define the items and services that company employees can order for internal use .
- Configure your procurement category hierarchy before you create the catalog .
- Determine which products you want your employees to be able to order . You can show or hide specific products in a catalog node , or you can show or hide all the products in a node .
- Determine how many procurement catalogs you require . Access to a procurement catalog is determined by the catalog policy rule that you configure for the legal entity and operating unit that an employee is assigned to .
Several factors determine the products that employees can order and the procurement categories that they can use when they create purchase requisitions :
- The category access policy rule in the purchasing policy determines which procurement categories are available in the purchase requisition . If no rule is defined , all procurement categories are available .
- Employees can order a product only if it &apos;s in the active procurement catalog for your organization , and if it &apos;s in an enabled node and not hidden . The product must also be in a category that a particular employee has access to according to the category access policy rule .
The following table describes the tasks that must be completed before a purchasing professional can create a procurement catalog .
# # Setting up a catalog
title : Sales tax calculation methods in the Origin field
# Sales tax calculation methods in the Origin field
This article explains the options in the Origin field on the sales tax codes page and how sales tax is calculated based on the selected option for a sales tax code .
For each sales tax code that you create in the Sales tax codes page , you must select the method of calculation to apply to the tax base amount in the Origin field .
# # Percentage of net amount
The Percentage of net amount calculation method is the default value in the Origin field . The sales tax is calculated as a percentage of the purchase or sales amount , excluding any other sales taxes .
# # Percentage of gross amount
The tax authority has imposed special duties on an item . The duty amounts are added to the net amount before sales tax is calculated . Given the following sales tax codes :
- SALESTAX = 25 % , using the Percentage of gross amount calculation method
&#124; Only one tax code with Origin = Percentage of gross amount can be used for a transaction . If more than one such tax code is determined for a transaction an error will be displayed that sales tax cannot be calculated . &#124;
Given the following sales tax codes :
- SALESTAX = 25 % , using the Percentage of gross amount method
&#124; Multilevel tax on tax calculations are not possible . A tax cannot be calculated based on a tax which already is calculated based on another tax . Multiple single level tax on tax codes can be calculated on a transaction . &#124;
When you select Amount per unit in the Origin field , sales tax is calculated as a fixed amount per unit multiplied with the quantity entered on the document line . A unit has to be selected in the Unit field . The amount per unit is specified in the Sales tax code values page .
# # # Amount per unit , additional option
On the Calculation tab , you can select whether an amount per unit calculated tax is calculated before other tax codes and added to the net amount before other tax codes with Origin = Percentage of net amount are calculated .
- DUTY : Origin = Amount per unit and a sales tax , the value is set to 5.00 per unit = pcs
We sell 1 piece of an item at a unit price of 10.00
# # # # Example 1
# # # # Example 2
# # # # Example 3
# # # # Example 4
# # Calculated percentage of net amount
The Calculated percentage of net amount handles tax calculation differently depending on the setting of the Amounts include sales tax parameter for the document or journal .

# Solver strategy for product configuration
This topic describes how you can use the solver strategy to improve the performance of product configuration .
The solver strategy concept now consists of the following strategies :
- Minimal domains first
Real customer implementation studies have shown that a change in the solver strategy for a product configuration model can reduce the response time from minutes to milliseconds . Therefore , it &apos;s worth the effort to try different solver strategies to find the most efficient strategy for your product configuration model .
# # Change the settings for the solver strategy
Currently , there is no logic that automatically detects which solver strategy will be the most efficient strategy for constraint-based product configuration . Therefore , you must try the solver strategies one by one .
The following table provides recommendations about the solver strategy to use in various scenarios .
&#124; Solver strategy &#124; Use the strategy in this scenario &#124;
The following examples show how to use segments to create number sequence formats . In particular , the examples demonstrate the effects of using scope segments .
# # # Expense report numbers
&#124; Segments &#124; Segment type &#124; Value &#124;
# # # Sales order numbers
# # # Purchase requisition numbers
In the following example , purchase requisition numbers are organization-wide .
Consider the following information about how the configuration of number sequences can affect system performance before you set up number sequences .
# # # Continuous and non-continuous number sequences
Unless there is a regulatory requirement that you use continuous number sequences , we recommend that you use non-continuous number sequences for better performance .
In case of a power failure , an application error , or other unexpected failure , the system cannot recycle numbers automatically for continuous number sequences . You can run the cleanup process manually or automatically to recover the lost numbers .
Carefully consider server usage when you plan the cleanup process . We recommend that you perform the cleanup as a batch job during non-peak hours .

title : LIFO Date with physical value and marking
# LIFO Date with physical value and marking
We recommend a periodic inventory closing when you use the LIFO Date inventory model .
The following examples show the effect of using LIFO Date in three configurations :
- LIFO Date with marking
# # LIFO Date without the Include physical value option
In this example , the item model group isn &apos;t marked to include physical value . The illustration that follows shows these transactions :
- 1b . Inventory financial receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 10.00 each .
- 2a . Inventory physical receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 20.00 each .
- 2b . Inventory financial receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 20.00 each .
- 3a . Inventory physical receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 25.00 each .
- 5a . Inventory physical receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 30.00 each .
- 5b . Inventory financial receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 30.00 each .
The new running average cost price reflects the average of the financially updated transactions at USD 15.00 .
- Inventory transactions are represented by vertical arrows .
- Receipts into inventory are represented by vertical arrows above the timeline .
- An inventory transaction value that is enclosed in parentheses indicates that the inventory transaction is physically posted into inventory .
- An inventory transaction value that isn &apos;t enclosed in parentheses indicates that the inventory transaction is financially posted into inventory .
- Each new receipt or issue transaction is designated by a new label .
- Inventory closings are represented by a red vertical dashed line and the label * Inventory Close * .
- Settlements that are performed by inventory close are represented by red diagonal dashed arrows that go from a receipt to an issue .
# # LIFO Date with the Include physical value option
In this example , the item model group is marked to include physical value .
The illustration that follows shows these transactions :
The new running average cost price reflects the average of the financially updated transactions at USD 20.00 .
Before inventory close is performed , these two transactions can still be marked to each other .
For example , a receipt transaction is marked for an issue transaction . In this case , the valuation method that is defined in the item ’ s item model group is disregarded , and the system settles these transactions against each other .
You can also mark an issue transaction to a receipt after the transaction is posted . You can match or mark an issue transaction for an open receipt transaction for an inventoried item from a posted inventory adjustment journal .
- 4a . Inventory physical receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 30.00 each .
- 4b . Inventory financial receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 30.00 each .
- 6a . Inventory physical issue for a quantity of 1 at a cost price of USD 21.25 each .
The new running average cost price reflects the average of the financially and physically updated transactions at USD 27.50 .

title : EU Sales list reporting
This article provides information about European Union ( EU ) Sales list reporting .
- VAT identification number of the EU customer
- Total value of the intra-community supplies of goods and services that are made to the EU customer in that period . The supplier must also separate general supplies of goods from triangular trade supplies . A triangular trade transaction involves direct delivery of goods from the supplier &apos;s supplier to its customer when both parties are registered in other member states of the EU .
By using the ESL , tax authorities of each EU member state can verify whether VAT has been paid for each intra-community transaction . The combination of listings and VAT returns let EU member states exchange information about the flow of goods throughout the EU .
You can complete the following tasks for EU Sales list reporting :
The following table shows the prerequisites that must be in place before you start .
# # Working with the ESL
# # # Collecting information about intra-community trade transactions
Transactions of the following types can be considered intra-community trade transactions :
- Sales invoices
- Free text invoices
- Project invoices
- Vendor invoices
# # # Closing the EU Sales list reporting period
This article provides information about delayed dates in master planning . A delayed date is a realistic due date that a transaction receives if the earliest fulfillment date that master planning calculates is later than the requested date .
Master planning can calculate the earliest fulfillment date for a transaction , based on lead times , material availability , capacity availability , and various planning parameters .
In some situations , you might choose not to calculate delays , such as when users know that they can expedite lead times by selecting alternative modes of delivery .
You can configure how delays are calculated for a coverage group . You can then attach the coverage group to an item later .

title : Pay based on registrations
- Flex time
- Switch codes
- Pay items
- Pay agreements
# # The use of flex time
The two scenarios that follow are based on a flex profile that represents a workday . For both scenarios , pay is calculated according to the flex period where the worker clocks in and out .
# # # Flex profile for one workday
&#124; Profile type &#124; Start &#124; End &#124; Day &#124;
The worker &apos;s registrations for the day looks like this .
&#124; Journal registration type &#124; Start &#124; End &#124;
To understand this scenario , see the following fields .
# # # # Calculation of Flex +
# # # # Calculation of Flex-
# # # # Calculation of Pay time
# # # Scenario 2 : A worker works during the whole Flex- period and also works overtime
# # # # Calculation of Pay overtime
# # # Generation of pay items
The pay items are the basis for a worker &apos;s pay . You can generate a file that includes the information from the pay items and transfer that file to a payroll system .
For example , for scenario 2 , the following pay items are generated .
If you want to clearly distinguish standard time and overtime , so that the pay units for the pay types cover only the actual time spend on standard time and overtime , the pay units for standard time must be calculated as 8.50 , and the pay units for overtime must be calculated as 1.50 .
To configure the system to clearly distinguish standard time and overtime , you must exclude overtime from the standard time . You must also change the setup of the pay type for overtime so that the pay rate for overtime covers all payments for the hours that were spent on overtime .
# # # Exclude overtime from the standard time
# # # Allow a deviation from the standard pay profiles
Consider the following flex profile that represents a workday .
The following pay items are generated after the transfer .
# # # # Planned breaks
# # # # Registered breaks
# # # # Paid and unpaid breaks
# # # Example of a planned break
Consider the following time profile that includes an unpaid break for lunch .
&gt; The system calculated 0.5 hours of unpaid break time , and that time isn &apos;t part of the pay time .
Consider the following time profile that doesn &apos;t include planned breaks .
When the registrations are calculated , the time for the activities is calculated .
&#124; Journal registration type &#124; Start &#124; End &#124; Time &#124;
If the planned break had been paid instead of unpaid , the calculation result would look like this .
# # # Pay items and paid breaks
The pay rate for a paid break is determined by the pay type that is set up in the pay agreements for the break . Instead of using a pay type , you can set up the cost price per hour on the break for a defined date interval .
Consider the following time profile .
&#124; Wage type &#124; Pay type &#124; Pay units &#124; Rate &#124;
# # How the cost of paid breaks is allocated to projects and production orders
# # # Cost calculation based on pay rates that are calculated in Time and attendance
The following example shows how the hourly cost is calculated when the cost is set up so that it &apos;s calculated based on pay rates .
Consider the following registrations that use the same time profile as the previous example .
After the registrations are transferred , the following transferred registrations are generated .
&#124; Registration type &#124; Time &#124; Cost price per hour &#124;
# # Scenarios based on various combinations of work hour registrations
The following scenarios show the pay items and entries for approval that are generated for workers based on their registrations . All the scenarios are based on the following time profile .
# # # Scenario 1 : The worker clocks in later than planned
Here is how the worker &apos;s registrations for the day appear on the * * Approve * * page after calculation .
# # # Scenario 4 : The worker clocks in late and clocks out after the planned clock-out time during an overtime period
The following example shows how a worker &apos;s flex account can be reduced by converting the absence period to a Flex- period .
Here is how the worker &apos;s registrations for the day appear on the * * Approve * * page before calculation .
If the worker selects an absence code for illegal absence , here is how the resulting pay item will look after the registration is transferred .
If the worker selects an absence code for legal absence , and the absence code is set up to reduce her flex account , here is how the resulting pay items will look after the registrations are transferred .
# # # Scenario 6 : There is no planned absence for the day and no worker attendance for the day

title : Modeling a lean organization
The article provides information about the key concepts in modeling a lean organization .
Typically , a lean manufacturing scenario is more than just a collection of unrelated kanban rules or material supply policies . The flow of material and products throughout work cells and locations for a specific production or supply scenario can be described as a sequence or small network of process or transfer activities . This sequence or network is known as a production flow .
# # Semi-finished products ( non-BOM levels )
# # Products and material in work in progress
# # Value streams and value stream mapping
The value stream itself is modeled as an operating unit . Therefore , the value stream can be used as a financial dimension .
# # Costing for lean manufacturing based on the production flow
The periodic consolidation of the cost for a production flow corrects the related WIP account and enables variances to be determined for the products that are supplied by the production flow .

title : Calculations for product configuration models FAQ
# Calculations for product configuration models FAQ
This topic describes calculations for product configuration models and explains how to use calculations together with constraints .
# # What is a calculation ?
# # What is a target attribute ?
A target attribute is an attribute that receives the result of the calculation expression .
In the following expression , the target attribute is a tablecloth measurement :
# # What attribute types can be set to target attributes ?
All attribute types that the product configurator supports can be set to target attributes , except text without a fixed list .
# # Can the value of a target attribute restrict the values of the input attributes in a calculation ?
In the following expression , the target for the calculation is the length of a power cord , and the input value is a color :
# # When do calculations occur ?
Calculations occur when a value has been provided for all input attributes .
You can overwrite the value that is calculated for the target attribute , unless the target attribute is set as hidden or read-only .
# # How do I set a target attribute as hidden or read-only ?
To set an attribute as hidden or read-only , follow these steps .
# # Can a calculation overwrite the values that I set ?
No . The values that you set when you configure a product are the values that are used . The calculation that occurs when the input values in a calculation are changed can ’ t overwrite the values that you provide for a specific attribute .
# # What happens if I remove an input value in a calculation ?
If you remove an input value in a calculation , the value of the target attribute is also removed .
# # Why do I receive an error message that says that my model is in contradiction ?
- A value is divided by 0 ( zero ) .
- The values that are available for an attribute and are limited by a constraint
- A value that is generated by a calculation
# # Why do I receive an error message even though I successfully validated my product model ?
Calculations aren &apos;t included in the validation . You must test the product configuration model to find errors in calculations . To test a product configuration model , follow these steps .

Analysis of the time that is used to process work items can help drive improvements in the warehouse workers ’ efficiency . The following reports are available to help with this analysis :
title : Dual currency
The posting logic has been changed for all transactions that generate an accounting entry to general ledger . Here is how the reporting currency was previously calculated :
Here is the new calculation :
Transaction currency amount \ &gt; Accounting currency amount
Transaction currency amount \ &gt; Reporting currency amount
Because of this change , exchange rates must now exist between CAD and USD , and between CAD and EUR .
Various reports and inquiries now show both reporting currency amounts and accounting currency amounts . Not every report and inquiry has been updated . For example , reports that show amounts only in the transaction currency haven &apos;t changed .
The changes follow one of two patterns :
- If the report or inquiry had enough space to show amounts in both the accounting currency and the reporting currency , the reporting currency amounts were added .
- If the report or inquiry didn &apos;t have enough space to show amounts in both currencies , an option was added so that users can select which currency is shown .
For various reports and inquiries , logic was also added to suppress the reporting currency amounts if the reporting currency is the same as the accounting currency , or if the reporting currency wasn &apos;t defined on the ledger for the legal entity .
If a reporting currency was defined on the ledger , the general ledger already tracked reporting currency amounts on every accounting entry . However , those amounts are now translated from the transaction currency amounts .
The following additional changes were made in the * * General ledger * * module :
# # # Accounts payable and Accounts receivable
- Reporting currency amounts are now shown on transactions for both customers and vendors . Reporting currency amounts are also shown for the open balance of each transaction .
- The aging process has been updated so that an organization can view the aging buckets in either the accounting currency or the reporting currency .
# # # Cash and bank management
In addition , major changes have been made to the depreciation process . These changes require user action after an upgrade . It &apos;s important that you read and understand the following changes , even if you aren &apos;t yet using Fixed assets .
- The way that the depreciation process determines the reporting currency amount has changed . The following scenario compares how depreciation previously determined the reporting currency amount and how it determines the reporting currency amount now .
An asset is acquired and posted with the following amounts . Note that the reporting currency amount is posted in the general ledger , but it isn &apos;t stored in the Fixed asset subledger tables .
At the end of the year , the depreciation proposal is run and calculates the following amounts .
* * New depreciation for the reporting currency * *
The depreciation process has been changed so that the reporting currency amount is also calculated by using the depreciation method . Here are the results when depreciation is run on the asset .
- The exchange rate and reporting currency amounts can be changed . If the exchange rate is changed , the reporting currency amount is recalculated by using the new rate .
- If a deprecation transaction type is entered in the Fixed asset journal , the reporting currency amounts will appear in the new columns . Those amounts can be changed .

Accounts payable invoice matching is the process of matching vendor invoice , purchase order , and product receipt information .
You can use the following types of Accounts payable invoice matching :
- Two-way matching – Match the price information on the invoice to the price information on the purchase order .
- Three-way matching – Match the price information on the invoice to the price information on the purchase order . Also match the quantity information on the invoice to the quantity information on the product receipts that are selected for the invoice .
&gt; Other forms of invoice validation can be done using vendor invoice policies .
Two-way matching and three-way matching always match price information by the unit price . You can also configure these matching policies to match price information by the price total .
- Net unit price matching – Match price information for two-way matching or three-way matching by comparing the net unit price for each line on the invoice with the corresponding net unit price on the purchase order . The net unit price is determined by the following formula : Net amount of the line / Quantity of the line
# # Two-way , price totals matching
Use two-way matching to help make sure that the variance between the price information on the purchase order and the invoice is within acceptable tolerances . You can compare price information for the net amount of each line on the invoice , and all pending and previously posted invoice lines , with the net amount of the corresponding purchase order line . This is called price totals matching .
If a purchase price total tolerance amount is specified , five fields are compared , as shown in the following table . Because the purchase price total tolerance amount is 100.00 , the price total variance amount of 105.00 represents a matching discrepancy .
Price totals matching is controlled for the legal entity by the Match price totals field on the Accounts payable parameters page . The purchase price total tolerance percentage and tolerance amount ( not-to-exceed amount ) are also specified on that page .
# # Two-way , net unit price matching
Use two-way matching to help make sure that the variance between the price information on the purchase order and the invoice is within acceptable tolerances . You can compare price information for the net unit price of each item on the invoice . This is called net unit price matching .
# # Two-way , price totals matching and net unit price matching
You can use price totals matching and net unit price matching together . This example assumes the following configuration :
- The price totals matching tolerance for the legal entity is 15 % or 500.00 .
The purchase order contains the following line .
&#124; Item number &#124; Quantity &#124; Unit price &#124; Net amount &#124;
&#124; Line field &#124; Invoice value &#124; Match status &#124;
&#124; Total product receipts matched &#124; 0.00 &#124; Failed &#124;
&gt; A variance percentage of 99,999,999,999.99 % means that the expected amount based on the purchase order is zero and the actual amount on the invoice is a positive value .
Charges matching is controlled for the legal entity by the Match charges toggle on the Accounts payable parameters page . You can set up variance tolerance percentages for charges on the Charges tolerances page .
&gt; Charges matching is performed only on charges codes for which the Compare purchase order and invoice values toggle is selected on the Charges code page .

title : Depreciation effects with reversals
This article discusses potential implications of reversing a fixed asset transaction .
The following examples show the calculations that occur if you continue beyond the message without first reversing the depreciation transactions .
# # Example 1 : Depreciation is overstated
An asset is set up with a 5-year useful life and straight line depreciation ( 60 depreciation periods ) . In this example , depreciation is overstated .
# # # # Asset transaction history
&#124; Date &#124; Transaction type &#124; Amount &#124;
&#124; January 1 &#124; Acquisition &#124; 59,000.00 &#124;
&#124; January 1 &#124; Acquisition adjustment &#124; 1,000.00 &#124;
# # # # Reversal action
&#124; January 1 &#124; Acquisition adjustment reversal &#124; – 1,000.00 &#124;
Depreciation is overstated by 16.95 ( 1,000 - 983.05 ) .
# # Example 2 : Depreciation is understated
An asset is set up with a 5-year useful life and straight line depreciation ( 60 depreciation periods ) . In this example , depreciation is understated .

title : Actions in workflow approval processes
# Actions in workflow approval processes
This article explains the actions that each participant in a workflow approval process can take .
The following sections explain the workflow actions that each group can perform .
# # Actions that an originator can perform
# # Actions that a task assignee can perform
When a user rejects a document , the workflow process ends .
When a user delegates a task , the task is assigned to another user .
Tim then acts on behalf of Julie . Therefore , when Tim completes his review , the expense report is assigned to John , just as if Julie had completed the task .
When a user requests a change to a document that was submitted , the document is sent back to the originator .
Sam can resubmit the expense report . He can make the requested changes first , or he can resubmit the original version . If Sam resubmits the expense report , a member of the work item queue must review the expense report and the receipts again .
The members of a work item queue can reassign documents that are in that queue to another queue .
# # Actions that a decision maker can perform
When a decision maker delegates a decision , the document is assigned to another user who must make the decision .
For example , Sam &apos;s expense report is assigned to John . John delegates the decision to Maria , who is his assistant .
When an approver rejects a document , the workflow process ends .
When an approver delegates a document , the document is assigned to another user for approval .
For example , Sam has submitted an expense report for USD 12,000 , and this document is assigned to Frank . Frank delegates the expense report to Ann .
When an approver requests a change to a document , the document is sent back to the originator .

title : Product identifiers
This topic provides information about the various types of product identifiers and explains how you can add product identifiers in your product data .
# # Unique product number / product ID
# # Product name and description
For product variants , the product name can be generated through a product nomenclature template . Because there is no requirement that product names be unique , you might find multiple products that have the same name .
# # Product and item search names
# # External product identifiers ( Customer and vendor identifiers )
You can maintain the external product identifiers by released product , released product variant , customer or customer group , or vendor or vendor group .
On the * * Released products * * page , follow one of these steps .
&#124; Field &#124; Corresponding customer information &#124; Corresponding vendor information &#124;
&#124; External item number &#124; The customer &apos;s item number &#124; The vendor &apos;s item number &#124;
&#124; Description &#124; The name that the customer associates with the item &#124; The name that the vendor associates with the item &#124;
Before you define bar codes , you can define one or more bar code setups . The bar code setups can help validate that bar codes follow the required guidelines , and that they can therefore be effectively printed and scanned . You can also maintain special bar codes for specific product quantities .
Unfortunately , there is no standard functionality that lets you search for products by external codes .
# # Data entities that are used to import and export product identifiers
&#124; Entity name &#124; Import identifiers &#124; Export identifiers &#124; Comments &#124;
# # # Product and item number sequences
In Finance and Operations , you can define two different number sequences :
- The * * Product number * * number sequence for the global product number
- The * * Item number * * number sequence for the item number per legal entity
- Settings of the * * Product number * * number sequence
- The mapping of the item number
- The mapping of the product number
The following table provides an overview of the results of import and manual creation when specific combinations of the number sequence and field mapping settings .
# # Product entity identifier ( Export all product identifiers )
Follow these steps to configure the environment .
Note that , for bar codes , a code type is generated for each bar code setup . For external codes , a code type is generated for each external code class .

title : Inventory close
As part of the process to settle issue transactions with receipt transactions , you can also choose to have the general ledger updated to reflect the adjustments that have been made .
Items in inventory are assigned to one of two inventory types : item or service . Inventory close performs the same functions for both types . However , for service items , inventory close still settles issues to receipts .
How often the inventory close process is run varies by company . However , transaction volume should help determine how often you decide to run inventory close . In general , most companies run inventory close as part of their month-end close and reconciliation procedures .
# # Inventory recalculation and the general ledger
If adjustments to inventory and the general ledger are required during a month or other inventory period , you can run inventory recalculation instead of inventory close . Inventory recalculation makes adjustments but doesn &apos;t make settlements to inventory transactions .
After the update is completed , you can review the ledger voucher that is posted because of one of these tasks .
# # Effects of the inventory close process on the general ledger
- Inventory close isn &apos;t required if you use the Standard cost valuation method .
- Before you run the closing procedure , you can view a list of items that can &apos;t be settled during the update .
- We recommend that you run inventory close during off-peak hours , to distribute computing resources more evenly .
# # The inventory close log
After the inventory close process has been completed , a message in the message center might inform you that a unit cost price might be incorrect because a transaction could not be fully settled .
Before this message is shown , the system reports the item number and the affected transaction . The message informs you that the cost amount that is used for this transaction wasn &apos;t updated because of the inventory close . This message appears when a transaction of the issue type can &apos;t be settled .
For each run of the closing procedure , the system indicates whether a log that contains the warnings is stored and can be viewed .
- Update receipts financially .
- Advance the closing date .
- Reevaluate the business procedures .
In some circumstances , you might not be able to do anything about the warnings . For example , if marking is used , and the marked purchase order has a financial date that is after the closing date , the closing date can &apos;t be changed .

title : Routes and operations
If you enable the more complex route networks in the Production control parameters , you can define routes that have multiple starting points and operations that can be run in parallel .
- Each operation can have only one successor operation , and the whole route must end in a single operation .
Both the primary operation and the secondary operations must have the same operation number ( 30 in the preceding illustration ) .
# # # Approval of routes
&#124; Inspection &#124; Quality inspection &#124;
The following operational properties of an operation are maintained on the operation relation :
- Cost categories
- Consumption parameters
- Processing times
- Resource requirements
- Notes and instructions
Operation relations give you lots of flexibility when you define your routes . Additionally , the ability to define default properties helps reduce the amount of master data that you must maintain . However , this flexibility also means that you must be aware of the context that you modify an operation relation in .
You can also manually create an operation that is specific to a route and released product by using the * * Copy and edit relation * * function .
# # # Maintaining operation relations per route
# # # Maintaining operation relations per operation
# # # Applying operation relations
Route versions are used to accommodate variations in the production of products or provide greater control over the production process . They define which route should be used when a specific released product or released product variant is produced . You can use the following constraints to define which route is used for a released product :
- Production quantity
- Production date
In the Production control parameters , you can require that the validity period of a route version always be specified .
# # # Approval of route versions
# # # Activating the default route version
# # # Product change that uses case management
The product change case for the approval and activation of new or changed routes and route versions gives you an easy way to see an overview of the route version constraints . You can also approve and activate all routes that are related to a specific change in one operation and document the results in the product change case .

A valid BOM version , whether site-specific or general , must meet the required criteria for date and quantity .
title : Retail sales price management
The following terms are used in this topic .
&#124; Term &#124; Definition , usage , and notes &#124;
In the retail industry , it &apos;s very typical to have different prices in different channels . The two primary factors that affect channel-specific prices are costs and local market conditions .
Loyalty programs can have multiple tiers , and the discounts can differ for different tiers . In this way , retailers can give frequent customers larger rewards without having to manually put those customers into a special group .
Loyalty programs have additional functionality besides prices and discounts . However , from the perspective of pricing and discounts , they are the same as affiliations .
Avoid setting price groups directly on a customer . Instead , use an affiliation . In this way , you can assign all types of prices and discounts to customers , not just sales price trade agreements .
The price and a discount can come from two different pricing priorities , because pricing priorities apply to prices and discounts independently .
To use pricing priority for prices , you must assign a pricing priority to a price group and then create a sales price trade agreement for that price group .
Let &apos;s look at an example where store prices override other prices .
Two products that the retailer sells are product 1 , a commodity T-shirt , and product 2 , brand-specific fashion jeans .
In Microsoft Dynamics 365 , you can set the price of a product in three places :
- Directly on the product ( base price )
- In a sales price trade agreement
If a retail channel &apos;s currency differs from the company currency , the base price in that retail channel is determined by using currency conversion on the price that is set on the product .
&gt; A trade agreement price is always used before the base price .
# # Determining price for a product in a transaction
The retail pricing engine returns three prices for every product : the base price , the trade agreement price , and the active price .
The base price is just the property on the product and is the same for everyone everywhere .
The category price rules feature in Retail gives you an easy way to create new trade agreements for all the products in a category . This feature also lets you automatically find existing trade agreements for the products in the category and expire them .
- In the * * Price basis * * field , select the type of price to modify :
To easily update the prices of various products from different product categories , you can use the supplemental product categories together with the category price rules .
# # Prices that include tax vs. prices that exclude tax
# # Differences between retail pricing and non-retail pricing
Retail pricing is designed to work with retail entities instead of non-retail entities . Specifically , it &apos;s designed to set prices by store , not by warehouse .
The retail pricing engine doesn &apos;t support the following pricing features :
- Setting price by using the Site and Warehouse storage dimensions
- Attribute-based pricing
- Vendor discount pass-through
In addition , * * only * * the retail pricing engine supports the following pricing features :
- The same price group can be used to control pricing and discounts .

title : Job scheduling
This article provides information about job scheduling , which is a more detailed form of scheduling than operations scheduling . You can use job scheduling to schedule individual jobs or shop orders , and to control the manufacturing environment .
# # Tasks in the job scheduling process
The job scheduling process includes the following tasks :
- Split operations into jobs .
- Calculate start times and end times for each job . You can use finite capacity to make sure that there are no overlapping times .
You can schedule jobs either forward or backward .
Job scheduling that is based on special properties requires that properties be specified for the operations on the production route . These properties must be fulfilled to reserve capacity .
Job scheduling schedules all productions that are referenced by the current production . If a production has one or more subproductions , the subproductions should be scheduled at the same time as the main production , because the main production can &apos;t be started until the related subproductions are completed .

# Configuration keys and data entities
Before you use data entities to import or export data , we recommended that you first determine the impact of configuration keys on the data entities that you are planning to use .
# # # Configuration key assignments
Configuration keys can be assigned to one or all of the following artifacts .
- Data entities
- Tables used as data sources
- Table fields
- Data entity fields
The following table summarizes how configuration key values on the different artifacts that underlie an object change the expected behavior of the object .
# # # Entity list refresh
# # # Data entity list page
The data entity list page in the Data management workspace shows the configuration key settings for the entities . Start from this page to understand the impact from configuration keys on the data entity .
Certain entities have other entities as data sources , or are composite data entities : configuration key information for these entities is shown in the Child entities form . Use this form in the similar way to the entities list page described above . The target fields form for the child entity also behaves like what is described above .
# # # Using data entities
After understanding the full impact , if any , of configuration keys on the data entities that you would like to use , you can now proceed to using the data entities by adding them to data projects .
# # # Run time validations for configuration keys

title : Reverse a vendor payment
This article describes the differences between reversing , deleting , voiding , and rejecting a payment . Additionally , it explains the two methods for reversing a vendor check .
&#124; If your organization doesn &apos;t review check reversals before posting &#124; If your organization reviews check reversals before posting &#124;
# # Reverse posted checks after they are reviewed in the check reversal journal
# # # Review a reversal
- To reject the reversal , delete the reversal check journal .
# # Results of posting a reversal
When you post a check reversal , the following events occur :
- The reversal voucher is posted against the bank account that the check was issued from , to increase the bank account balance .
- The voucher is posted to General ledger .
- The original payment from the invoice that the payment was settled against is unapplied ( the settlement is reversed ) .
If the check that was reversed was issued for a customer refund , the following events also occur :
# Straight line service life depreciation
This article gives an overview of the Straight line service life method of depreciation .
When you set up a fixed asset depreciation profile and select Straight line service life in the Method field in the Depreciation profiles page , the assets that have this depreciation profile assigned to them are depreciated based on the total service life of the asset . This generally is the same depreciation amount in each depreciation period .
The difference in the depreciation amount that is calculated between straight line service life remaining and straight line service life is when there is an adjustment posted to the asset .
To set up straight line service life depreciation , you must also select options in the Depreciation year and Period frequency fields in the Depreciation profiles page .
You can select either Calendar or Fiscal in the Depreciation year field in the Depreciation profiles page . The selection defines the options that are available in the Period frequency field . The default option is Calendar .
If you select Calendar , a year of January 1 to December 31 is assumed , even if you have defined the fiscal calendar differently .
The Calendar option updates the depreciation base , which is typically the net book value minus the salvage value , on January 1 of each year . In the examples later in this topic , the depreciation base is the numerator in the first expression in the calculations column .
If you select Calendar , the following options are available in the Period frequency field , which defines the depreciation accrual posting dates and amounts throughout the calendar year :
- Monthly posts a monthly amount at the end of each calendar month .
- Half-Yearly posts a half-yearly amount at the end of each calendar half year ( June 30 and December 31 ) .
- Daily posts the depreciation amount for the daily depreciation method using one transaction for each day .
If you select Fiscal , the following options are available in the Period frequency field :
- Yearly posts the total amount of the depreciation that is calculated for the fiscal year as one amount on the last day of the fiscal year .
- Fiscal period calculates the total amount of the depreciation for the fiscal year , which is accrued into the periods that are defined in the Fiscal calendars form for the fiscal calendar .
# # Example : Straight line depreciation of an unchanged fixed asset
Suppose that a fixed asset has the following characteristics .
&#124; Yearly depreciation &#124; 2,000 &#124;
&#124; Period &#124; Calculation of yearly depreciation amount &#124; Net book value at the end of the year &#124;
# # Example : Straight line depreciation of a modified fixed asset
Suppose that you add an acquisition adjustment of 4,000 in year 2 to the same fixed asset .
The service life of the acquisition adjustment is the same as that of the fixed asset and starts at the time of its acquisition . A net book value remains at the end of year 5 , corresponding to the net book value of the acquisition adjustment . The depreciation by period is calculated as shown in the following table .
\ * Because the remaining amount is less than the depreciation amount , only the remaining amount minus the salvage value is taken .
Before synchronization of project tasks can occur , you must synchronize project contracts and projects .
&#124; Project Tasks &#124; Integration entity for project task &#124;
You must use Microsoft Power Query for Excel to filter data if this condition is met :
- You have resource-specific records in a project task .
title : Depreciation methods and conventions
You can select various depreciation methods and conventions . The purpose of the methods is to allocate the depreciable value of the fixed asset into fiscal periods . The depreciable value of the fixed asset is the acquisition price , reduced by a scrap value , if any .
If you are using depreciation conventions and you modify the last depreciation run date for an asset , which then causes some depreciations to be skipped , the depreciation for the last year might be more than or less than is expected . The depreciation is adjusted by the number of depreciation periods affected by the modification of the last depreciation run date .
You can select from the following depreciation conventions .
- Full month
- Mid quarter
- Mid month ( 1st of month )
- Mid month ( 15th of month )
- Half year ( start of year )
You can select from the following depreciation methods .
- Straight line service life
- Reducing balance
- Straight line life remaining

Cloud POS is a browser-based version of the Modern POS program that can be accessed in a web browser .
POS peripherals are typically divided into classes . This section describes and gives an overview of the devices that Modern POS supports .
- OPOS also supports a more extensive set of variables that are specific to retail receipt printers , such as paper cutting or slip printing .
# # # Universal Windows Platform
# # Hardware station deployment options
The network designation for devices in the hardware profile enables cash drawers , receipt printers , and payment terminals to be connected via a network connection .
# # # OPOS device setup and configuration
Within the ServiceOPOS registry location , configured devices are organized according to the OPOS device class . Multiple device drivers are saved .
# # Supported scenarios by hardware station type
# # # Client support – IPC hardware station vs. IIS hardware station
The following table shows the topologies and deployment scenarios that are supported .
# # Supported device types by hardware station type
# # Configuration for supported scenarios

13 . On the hardware station management page , set the option to turn on the hardware station .
15 . Repeat step 14 for each hardware station that Modern POS will use .
- Secure Sockets Layer ( SSL ) should be disabled .
- No additional network ports should be open , unless they are required for known , specified reasons .
- Only trusted certificate authorities should be used to obtain certificates that will be used on computers that run the hardware station .
The following peripherals were tested by using the IPC hardware station that is built into Modern POS for Windows .
# # # # Bar code scanner
# # # # PIN pad
# # # # Payment terminal
# # # # Cash drawer
# # # # Line display
# # # # Signature capture
# # # Dedicated IIS hardware station
- The computer that is running Modern POS trusts the certificate that is used on the computer that runs the hardware station .
- On the computer that runs the hardware station , the port that will be used by the hardware station is opened in the firewall .
- The hardware station has correctly installed merchant account information through the Install merchant information tool that runs at the end of the hardware station installer .
# # # Modern POS can ’ t detect the hardware station in its list for selection
- The hardware station hasn ’ t been set up correctly in headquarters . Use the steps earlier in this topic to verify that the hardware station profile and the hardware station are correctly entered .
- The jobs haven ’ t been run to update the channel configuration . In this case , run the 1070 job for channel configuration .
# # # Modern POS doesn &apos;t reflect new cash drawer settings

The ER engine is targeted at business users instead of developers . Because you configure formats instead of code , the processes for creating and adjusting formats for electronic documents are faster and easier .
The ER engine has the following capabilities :
- It supports the creation of a custom format that is based on an original format . It also includes capabilities for automatically upgrading the customized format when the original format is changed because of localization / customization requirements .
- It becomes the primary standard tool to support localization requirements in electronic reporting , both for Microsoft and for Microsoft partners .
# # # # Data model components
A data model component is an abstract representation of a data structure . It &apos;s used to describe a specific business domain area with enough detail to satisfy the reporting requirements for that domain . A data model component consists of the following parts :
- Company \ &gt; Vendor \ &gt; Payment transactions of the AP domain
- Customer \ &gt; Company \ &gt; Payment transactions of the AR domain
Note that business entities such as company and payment transactions are designed one time . Different mappings then reuse them .
A model mapping that supports outgoing electronic documents has the following capabilities :
- It supports user input parameters that can be defined as data sources for a data model when some data must be specified at run time .
A model mapping that supports incoming electronic documents has the following capabilities :
A data model component is designed for each business domain that should be used as a unified data source for reporting that isolates reporting from the physical implementation of data sources . It represents domain-specific business concepts and functionalities in a form that makes a reporting format &apos;s initial design and further maintenance more efficient .
# # # # Format components for outgoing electronic documents
A format component is the scheme of the reporting output that will be generated at run time . A scheme consists of the following elements :
- Data sources , as a set of user input parameters and a domain-specific data model that uses a selected model mapping .
- A format mapping , as a set of bindings of format data sources that have individual elements of a format that specify , at run time , the data flow and rules for format output generation .
A format component supports the following functions :
- Creation of multiple files separately and encapsulation of those files into zip files .
A format component lets you attach specific files that can be used in the reporting output :
- Excel workbooks that contain a worksheet that can be used as a template for output in the OPENXML worksheet format
- Word files that contain a document that can be used as a template for output in the Microsoft Word document format
- Other files that can be incorporated into the format &apos;s output as predefined files
The following illustration shows how the data flows for these formats .
# # # # Format components for incoming electronic documents
A format component is the scheme of the incoming document that is imported at run time . A scheme consists of the following elements :
Versioning is supported for ER components . The following workflow is provided to manage changes in ER components :
- The component can be serialized in XML format and exported as a file in XML format .
# # # # Component date effectivity
# # # # Component access
Each model configuration contains a data model component . A new format configuration can be derived from a specific data model configuration . In the configuration tree , the format configuration that is created appears as a child of the original data model configuration .
The format configuration that is created contains a format component . The data model component of the original model configuration is automatically inserted into the format component of the child format configuration as a default data source .
An ER configuration is shared for Finance and Operations companies .
# # # Translating data model content
- At design time , to make the content more intelligible for format designers who speak other languages , and who will use the data model for data mapping of format components .
The following illustration shows an example where data model content is translated from English to Japanese .

# Financial dimensions and main accounts in right-to-left languages
This topic describes some of the implementation decisions that you should consider when you use a right-to-left language , and you must set up financial dimensions and main accounts .
# # # Best practices for setting up financial dimensions and main accounts in a right-to-left system
- When you create financial dimension and main account values , use only numbers and right-to-left language characters .
- Avoid using the selected chart of accounts delimiter in financial dimension and main account values .
By following these best practices , you help guarantee consistent representation of the user defined-order throughout the system .
title : Expense management parameters
The parameters control the general behavior in Expense management .
# # # Fax cover pages
# Plan for the global address book and other address books
Before you begin to work with the global address book , you must determine the default values for it . These default values are then used for any additional address books that you create .
- When a new record is created , should users be notified if a duplicate record is found in the global address book ?
- If the DUNS number is included in a party record , should the uniqueness of the number be checked ?
- When a party record is created in the global address book , do you want a default party type , person , or organization ?
- Which user roles should have access to the private addresses and contact information of party records ?
- How many additional address books will you create ?
# # # Address book security
- Which teams should have access to each new address book that you will create ?
# Formula designer in Electronic reporting ( ER )
ER supports the formula designer . Therefore , at design time , you can configure expressions that can be used for the following tasks at runtime :
You can open the * * Formula designer * * page when you perform any of the following actions :
- Bind data source items to data model components .
- Bind data source items to format components .
- Complete maintenance of calculated fields that are part of data sources .
- Define the visibility conditions for user input parameters .
- Design a format &apos;s transformations .
- Define the enabling conditions for the format &apos;s components .
- Define the conditions for process control validations .
- Define the message text for process control validations .
The ER formula designer can be used to define an expression that transforms data that is received from data sources , so that the data can be entered in the data consumer at runtime :
- From an ER data model to an ER format
# # # Process flow control
The ER formula designer can be used to define expressions that control the process flow of generating electronic documents . You can perform the following tasks :
- Define conditions that determine when a document creation process must be stopped .
- Specify expressions that either create messages for the user about stopped processes or throw execution log messages about the continuing process of report generation .
- Specify the file names of generating electronic documents , and control the conditions of their creation .
The ER formula designer can also be used to generate a file name for a generating electronic document and control the file creation process . The following illustration shows the design of a process flow control of this type . Here is an explanation of the configuration in this example :
- The output creates a zip file that contains one file in XML format for every batch that was created .
- An expression returns a file name for generating electronic documents by concatenating the file name and the file name extension . For the second batch and all subsequent batches , the file name contains the batch ID as a suffix .
ER expressions can contain any or all of the following elements :
The following table shows the comparison operators that are supported . You can use these operators to compare two values .
Additionally , you can use an ampersand ( &amp; ) as a text concatenation operator . In this way , you can join , or concatenate , one or more text strings into a single piece of text .
# # # # # Operator precedence
If the methods of Finance and Operations data sources have parameters , the following syntax is used to call those methods :
- Quotation marks aren &apos;t required when a method name contains only alphanumeric symbols . However , they are required for a method of a table if the name includes brackets .
- Only constants can be passed to methods of this type . The values of the constants are defined at design time .
# # # Date and time functions
# # # Data conversion functions
&lt; td &gt; Define the following data sources in your model mapping :
&lt; td &gt; Return a new list that consists of enumerated records of the specified list , and that exposes the following elements :
&lt; td &gt; Return a record list that is created from an argument of one of the following types :
&lt; td &gt; In the following illustration , an enumeration is introduced in a data model .

title : Allocation bases
There are three types of allocation bases in Cost accounting :
- Predefined dimension member allocation bases
- Hierarchy allocation bases
- Formula allocation bases
# # Predefined dimension member allocation bases
The predefined dimension member allocation bases are created automatically when a dimension member of one the following types is created :
- Statistical dimension members
&gt; The predefined dimension member allocation bases that are based on a cost element dimension member consider the values only from the data source provider , such as the general ledger or budget .
In the general ledger , the chart of account is defined as follows .
&#124; Chart of account &#124; Main account &#124; Description &#124; Main account type &#124;
Define a cost element dimension , and configure the data connector . After the data is imported , the following entries are created in Cost accounting .
* * Cost element dimension members * *
&#124; Cost element dimension name &#124; Cost element &#124; Description &#124; Type &#124;
* * Predefined dimension member allocation bases * *
&#124; Name &#124; Description &#124; Cost element dimension &#124;
In the general ledger , the following entries have been posted :
- The expense for employee insurance is manually posted to a default cost center .
After the general ledger source data is processed , the following entries are created in Cost accounting .
&#124; Cost object dimension hierarchy node &#124; Cost element dimension hierarchy node &#124; Cost behavior &#124; Allocation base &#124;
* * Cost object balance journal entries * *
Statistical dimension members can be used as allocation bases to define policies or report non-monetary consumption by cost objects . You can manually create statistical dimension members or import them from a file by using the Data management import / export tool .
&#124; Statistical dimension name &#124; Statistical element &#124; Description &#124; Unit &#124;
&#124; Name &#124; Description &#124; Statistical element dimension &#124;
&#124; FTE &#124; Full time employees &#124; Statistical elements &#124;
&#124; Electricity &#124; Electricity consumption &#124; Statistical elements &#124;
- Electricity consumption can be measured by meters that are installed in different areas of the company .
- Tables hold statistical measures . For example , the HcmEmployment table holds a list of all employees and the cost centers that they work for .
&#124; Name &#124; Cost center &#124; Description &#124; Worker type &#124;
&gt; All the tables that contain financial dimensions can be used as sources for statistical measures .
Cost accounting supports a collection of statistical measures by using the following data connections :
- Data management import / export tool
- Statistical measures
* * Statistical measure provider templates * *
After the statistical measure source data is processed , the following entries will be created in Cost accounting .
&#124; Cost object &#124; Description &#124; Magnitude &#124; Allocation factor &#124;
&#124; Accounting date &#124; Dimension member &#124; Magnitude &#124; Source identifier &#124;
Here is an example of a cost distribution rule if the Electricity predefined dimension member allocation basis is assigned as the allocation base in it .
# # # Example : Hierarchy allocation bases that are based on full-time employees in the organization
Here is an example of a cost object dimension hierarchy that can be created to describe a simplified organization .
The FTE ’ s predefined dimension member allocation basis that was created in the previous section holds the following entries .
&#124; Name &#124; Allocation base &#124; Cost object dimension hierarchy &#124; Cost object dimension hierarchy node &#124;
A Preview function lets you validate the hierarchy allocation basis that is created , based on statistical entries in the system .
* * Allocation base details * *
Here is an example of a cost distribution rule if the Number of FTEs in CFO hierarchy allocation basis is assigned as the allocation base in it .
Formula allocation bases let you define advanced formulas to achieve the correct allocation basis . You can manually create formula allocation bases .
When you create a formula allocation base , you select which statistical dimension and cost element dimension should be the basis for the formula . All allocation bases that come from the previously selected dimensions can be used in a formula allocation base .
&gt; Previously defined formula allocation bases can be used to define a new formula allocation base .
In formula allocation base factors , you create an alias , and associate it with either an allocation base or a constant . The aliases are then used to define the formula .
You can use the following operators to define your formula .
# # # Example 1 : A simple formula
Electricity bills often consist of two parts :
- A fixed fee for being connected to grid
The Electricity predefined dimension member allocation basis has already been defined and holds these values .
If the fixed fee must now be evenly spread over cost objects that consume electricity , you have two options for allocating the costs :
- Create a new predefined allocation base , Electricity fixed , and then apply a statistical measure of 1.00 for each cost object that consumed electricity .
&#124; Electricity fixed &#124; &#124; Statistical elements &#124; &#124;
* * Formula allocation base factors * *
&#124; Alias &#124; Constant &#124; Allocation base &#124;
Note that 0 ( zero ) isn &apos;t supported as a constant .
A Preview function lets you validate the formula allocation base that is created , based on statistical entries in the system .
Here is an example of a cost distribution rule if the Electricity formula allocation base is assigned as the allocation base in it .
&#124; Cost object &#124; Name &#124; Magnitude &#124; Allocation factor &#124;
# # # Example 2 : An advanced formula
For this example , the cost of electricity should not just follow the actual electricity that is consumed in kWh . Management wants to incorporate incentive for lowering electricity usage .
A new formula allocation base , Electricity usage , is created .
Here is a closer look at the formula for CC003 ( IT ) :
Here is an example of a cost distribution rule if the Electricity fixed formula allocation base is assigned as the allocation base in it .

# Bills of materials and formulas
When it &apos;s combined with a route or production flow that describes the operations and resources that are required in order to build a product , the BOM forms the foundation for calculating the estimated cost of the product .
A BOM is an individual entity that is described by the following information :
- BOM name
- The BOM lines that describe the components and ingredients
A single BOM describes a single level that is identified by a unique ID . Components might have their own BOMs that are referenced by BOM versions . You can display and edit the complete hierarchy of BOMs for a specific product in the BOM designer .
# # # BOMs in the product lifecycle
In the product lifecycle , many types of BOM might be created for various reasons :
# # # Approval of BOMs and formulas
Note that , if a BOM is unapproved , all related BOM versions are also unapproved .
# # BOM and formula versions
# # # Approval of BOM and formula versions
# # # Activation of the default BOM or formula version
# # # Product change with case management
# # # Alternative BOM versions
# # BOM and formula lines
A BOM line is created for each material , service , or ingredient . The line defines the planned consumption of the specified product variant and also defines the various attributes that are related to the planned consumption .

This topic provides examples of three-way matching .
Example : Three-way matching for items
The invoice matching policies in this example help people in the following roles meet these goals :
- Ken sets the matching policy at the legal entity level to Three-way matching .
- Ken sets the Automatically update header matching status toggle at the legal entity to Yes .
- Ken sets the Match price totals field for the legal entity to Percentage , and enters 15 % as the tolerance percentage .
- For items that require three-way matching , the quantity on the invoice line matches the quantity that was received . The received quantity is indicated on the product receipt that is matched to the invoice .
The paper invoice from Contoso contains the following information .
&#124; Item &#124; Quantity &#124; Unit price &#124; Net amount &#124;
Because this line passes the invoice matching process , the invoice can be posted .
# # Example : Three-way matching for item and vendor combinations
The volume and amounts are small , and there have been problems with delivery from some vendors in Malaysia . For these reasons , Cassie sets the level of control for certain item and vendor combinations that are procured in Malaysia to three-way matching .
- Ken sets the matching policy at the legal entity level to Two-way matching .
- Ken sets the Match price totals field for the legal entity to Percentage , and enters 10 % as the tolerance percentage .
- Ken sets the unit price tolerance for all items to 2 % .
- Cassie sets the matching policy at the item and vendor combination level for item PH2500 – Computer and vendor Contoso to Three-way matching .

title : Reason codes for inventory counting
# Reason codes for inventory counting
Reason codes let you analyze the results of a counting process and any discrepancies that occur during that process . You can specify the reason for doing the count , such as a broken pallet or a stock adjustment that is based on inventory samples .
Before you set up the system , we recommend that you define a strategy for working with reason codes . For example , try to answer the following questions :
- Should reason codes be mandatory on warehouses ?
- Should reason codes be mandatory or optional on some items ?
- How many reason codes do you require ?
- How should users of barcode scanners use reason codes ? Should the reason codes be preselected , mandatory , or not editable ?
- Do warehouse workers require different reason code behavior on mobile scanners ? If the answer is yes , you can create more menu items and assign them to different people .
# # Set up reason code policies
- Cycle Count ( mobile device )
- Spot Count ( mobile device )
- Threshold Count ( mobile device )
- Adjustment In ( mobile device )
- Adjustment Out ( mobile device )
- Counting Journal ( rich client )
You can also set up reason codes for individual warehouses and for products . The reason code setup for products can disregard the setup for warehouses .
# # # Set up reason codes for warehouses
# # # Use reason codes in counting journals
In a counting journal , you can add reason codes for counts of the following types :

title : Expression constraints and table constraints in product configuration models
# Expression constraints and table constraints in product configuration models
# # What are expression constraints ?
Expression constraints are characterized by an expression that uses arithmetic and Boolean operators and functions . An expression constraint is written for a specific component in a product configuration model . It can &apos;t be reused by or shared with another component . However , the expression constraints for a component can reference attributes of the component &apos;s subcomponents .
# # What are table constraints ?
# # # Example of a table constraint
&#124; Front grill &#124; Black , Metal , White &#124;
# # What syntax should be used to write constraints ?
# # Should I use table constraints or expression constraints ?
When you configure a product by using the following constraint setups , these combinations are allowed :
- A product in the color Black , and in size 30 or 50
- A product in the color Red and in size 20
# # # Table constraint setup
# # # Expression constraint setup
# # Should I use operators or infix notation when I write expression constraints ?
The following tables list the operators and infix notation that you can use when you write an expression constraint for a component in a product configuration model . The examples in the first table show how to write an expression by using either infix notation or operators .
The examples in the next table show how to write infix notation .
&#124; Infix notation &#124; Description &#124;

title : System-defined and user-defined table constraints
This article explains the two types of table constraints for components in a product configuration model - user-defined and system-defined . Table constraints represent matrices of the allowed attribute combinations , where each row defines one set of possible attribute values .
Table constraints represent matrices of the combinations of attributes that are allowed for components in a product configuration model . Each row in the table defines one set of possible attribute values . You can declare two types of constraints in a product configuration model :
&#124; Cabinet finish &#124; Front grill &#124;
When you create a system-defined table constraint , you select a table , optionally define the query to use , and then associate attribute types to the fields in the selected table . The types of fields must match the types of attribute types .

title : Post fixed asset transactions to posting layers
# Post fixed asset transactions to posting layers
This article gives an overview of posting layer functionality for fixed asset transactions .
A fixed asset is often depreciated in different ways for different purposes . Depreciation for tax purposes is calculated by using current tax rules to achieve the highest possible depreciation before taxes , but depreciation for reporting purposes is calculated according to accounting laws and standards . The various kinds of depreciation are calculated and recorded separately in the posting layers .
You can designate ledger accounts for fixed asset transactions on the Fixed asset posting profiles page . For each posting profile , you must select the relevant transaction type and book , and then designate the ledger accounts . Set up a posting profile record for each book that will post to the general ledger .

title : Information used in BOM calculations with standard costs
# Information used in BOM calculations with standard costs
The purchased item information that is used in a standard cost BOM calculation includes the following :
The manufactured item information that is used in a standard cost BOM calculation includes the following :
- Standard order quantity for inventory − The item ’ s standard order quantity for inventory , acts as the default accounting lot size for amortizing constant costs in a BOM calculation . The accounting lot size will also reflect the order quantity multiple if it is specified .
- Warning conditions that are embedded in the item ’ s BOM calculation group enable the BOM calculation to identify potential problems . One example could be that the manufactured item does not have a BOM or route . The applicable warning conditions can be overridden when initiating a BOM calculation .
The bill of material information that is used in a standard cost BOM calculation includes the following :
- BOM line item scrap − A component can have a variable or constant quantity for planned scrap .
- BOM line item valid dates − A component can have valid from and to dates .
- BOM line item type of production − The costing lot size for amortizing constant costs will reflect the BOM calculation quantity and a make-to-order explosion mode , because the BOM calculation assumes that the manufactured component will be produced to the exact quantity instead of its standard order quantity .
- Sub-BOM for a manufactured component − A manufactured component can optionally have a specified BOM version , which would be used instead of the item ’ s current active BOM version in a BOM calculation .
- Sub-route for a manufactured component − A manufactured component can optionally have a specified route version , which would be used instead of the item ’ s current active route version in a BOM calculation .
- Ignore BOM line item in cost calculations − A component can be ignored for BOM calculation purposes .
The operations resource information that is used in a standard cost BOM calculation includes :
- Hourly costs − The hourly costs that are associated with an operations resource are expressed as cost categories that are assigned to set up time and run time . These cost categories should be identified for resource groups and operations resources . The hourly costs that are associated with a cost category can be site-specific or company-wide .
- Overriding operations resource information on routing operations − The resource information about cost categories will be inherited by operations , where it can be overridden . BOM calculations will use the cost category information that is specified on the routing operations .
The route information that is used in a standard cost BOM calculation includes :
- Routing operation scrap percentage − BOM calculations will account for scrap percentages and cumulative scrap percentages across multiple operations . This applies to the required time for routing operations and the required quantity for components that are linked to operation numbers .
- Cost categories for a routing operation − Operations resource information about cost categories will be inherited by operations , where it can be overridden . BOM calculations will use the cost category information that is specified on the routing operations .
The manufacturing overhead information that is used in a standard cost BOM calculation includes :
- Time-based versus material-based overhead − The manufacturing overhead can be tied to routing operations or material components .
- Mandated fallback principle − The costing version can mandate the use of a fallback principle , such as using a specified costing version or the active cost records . The mandated fallback principle typically applies to a costing version that represents the incremental updates in a two-version approach for cost updates .
- Blocking flag for pending costs − A blocking flag can prevent BOM calculations of the pending cost for manufactured items .
- Specified from-date − The specified from-date will act as the default calculation date for all BOM calculations that involve the costing version .
- Specified site − A specified site will limit BOM calculations to the single site .
- Content of the costing version must include costs − The content must include costs . It can optionally include sales prices in order to calculate suggested sales prices for manufactured items .
Several sources of information can be specified when initiating a BOM calculation . This includes the site , the calculation date , and the costing version .

title : Credit and collections in Accounts receivable
# Credit and collections in Accounts receivable
Before you begin to set up or work with collections , you should understand the following concepts :
- Customer aging snapshots contain aged balance information at a point in time
- Collections customer pools help you organize your work
- Collections agents can have their own customer pools
- List pages organize collections customers , activities , and cases
- All collections information for a customer is on one page and you can take action from that page
- Waive , reinstate , or reverse interest and fees can be done in one step
- Process not sufficient funds ( NSF ) payments can be done in one step
The following sections describe each concept .
An aging snapshot contains the calculated aged balances for a customer at a point in time . This information is displayed on the Aged balances list page and on the Collections page . An aging snapshot must be created before you can view information on the Collections list pages .
For each customer , an aging snapshot contains an aging snapshot header and detail records that correspond to each aging period in the aging period definition .
The following list pages help you organize collections information .
- Collections activities – The columns on the list page display activities that are identified as collections activities . These activities are created by using the Collections page . Use activities to track the work that you do related to collections .
- Collections cases – The columns on the list page display information for cases that have a case category with a case type of Collections .
&gt; An aging snapshot must be created before you can view information on these list pages . Information is displayed only for customers for whom an aging snapshot has been created . The records that are shown on the list page can be additionally filtered , as follows :
Use the Collections page to view , manage , and take action on collections information , activities , and cases for a customer .
FactBoxes display aged balances and credit limit information for the selected customer . This information is stored in the aging snapshot . If necessary , you can update the aging snapshot with current information .
# # Waive , reinstate , or reverse interest and fees
You can write off bad debts by clicking Write off in the Collections form , and on the Aged balances , Customers , and Open customer invoices list pages .
When you write off transactions for a customer , all transactions for the customer are automatically marked for settlement . The amount that is written off depends on the net amount of the marked transactions . The write-off transaction is created in a general journal and can contain up to three types of journal lines .
The write-off transaction is created in the transaction currency .

title : Statistical dimension members and statistical measure provider templates
# Statistical dimension members and statistical measure provider templates
A statistical dimension and its members are used to register and control non-monetary entries in Cost accounting . Statistical dimension members can be used for two purposes :
- As an allocation base in policies such as cost distribution or cost allocation
- For reporting of non-monetary consumption
A statistical dimension has a unique name and a set of unique dimension members . The statistical dimension is assigned to a Cost accounting ledger ID . This relationship ties all corresponding statistical dimension members to the Cost accounting ledger . Therefore , all statistical entries will be created in the context of the Cost accounting ledger .
Here is an example of a statistical dimension .
&#124; Name &#124; Data connector for dimension members &#124;
&#124; Shared Statistical elements &#124; Imported dimension members &#124;
Here is an example of a statistical dimension that has been assigned to a Cost accounting ledger .
A statistical dimension member represents an entity that you want to register non-monetary measures for . These measures can be used either as an allocation base or just to report non-monetary values .
Statistical dimension members can be created manually . Alternatively , they can be imported from a file by using the Data management import / export tool .
A statistical dimension member automatically becomes a predefined allocation base . It can be used as an allocation base in policies or as input in other types of allocation bases .
Here are some examples of typical statistical dimension members .
&#124; Statistical dimension name &#124; Statistical elements &#124; Description &#124; Unit &#124;
# # Statistical measure provider template
The definition of a statistical measure provider template is generic and can be reused in multiple statistical dimension members .
&gt; All tables that contain financial dimensions can be used as sources for statistical measures .
* * Example : Count of employees per cost center * *
The count of employees per cost center is a statistical measure that can be used for various purposes that provide managerial insight :
- A statistical reporting measure by cost center
- An allocation base for various types of expenses
- Internal cost rates by cost center :
- Cost by employee
The HcmEmployment table holds a list of all employees in the instance . This table is a global table . Therefore , the records aren &apos;t related to a specific data area ID .
Here is an example of employees in the HcmEmployment table .
# # Using the Count function
For example , a statistical measure provider template can be set up as follows .
You can also add one or more ranges to narrow the measures from the source table .
&#124; Source table &#124; Field &#124; Criteria &#124;
Before you can get statistical measures into Cost accounting , you must establish the relation between the statistical measure provider template and the statistical dimension member . This relation is created per Cost accounting ledger and version . The relation consists of a data connector and a data provider . You can have several data connectors and data providers per statistical dimension member .
&#124; Name &#124; Data connector &#124; Statistical dimension member &#124;
&#124; Statistical template name &#124;
* * Statistical entry transfer journal entries * *
If the FTEs predefined dimension member allocation basis is assigned as an allocation base in a cost distribution rule , the cost will be distributed by using the following allocation factor .
# # Using the Sum function
The ProdRouteTrans table holds all production labor transactions per legal entity DataAreadID .
Here is an example of the ProdRouteTrans table .
The statistical measure provider template can be set up as follows .
You can also add ranges to narrow the measures from the source table .
The system recognizes that ProdRouteTrans is a table where each record belongs to a separate legal entity . Therefore , you will be asked to select the legal entity that transactions should be imported from .
&#124; Statistical template name &#124; Legal entity &#124;
&#124; Cost object &#124; Magnitude &#124; Allocation factor &#124;
You can import statistical measures into Cost accounting by using the Data management import / export tool .
The data entity that is used for the import is named Imported statistical measures .
&gt; This data entity is designed to allow a maximum of five unique dimension values per entry .
The consumption of electricity is recorded in Microsoft Excel by using the predefined format of the data entity . Here is an example .
When you &apos;ve imported your data via Data management , the data will be stored in a Cost accounting staging table . Therefore , the imported data can be used in multiple Cost accounting ledgers . A reload of data isn &apos;t required .
Before you can get statistical measures into Cost accounting , you must establish the relation between the source identifier and the statistical dimension member . This relation is created per Cost accounting ledger and version . The relation consists of a data connector and a data provider . You can have several data connectors and data providers per statistical dimension member .
&#124; Electricity &#124; Imported statistical measures &#124; Electricity &#124;
If the Electricity predefined dimension member allocation basis is assigned as an allocation base in a cost distribution rule , the cost will be distributed by using the following allocation factor .
title : Financial dimensions
This topic explains the various types of financial dimensions and how they are set up .
Before you set up financial dimensions as legal entities , evaluate your business processes in the following areas to determine whether this setup will work for your organization :
- Sales and purchases between financial dimensions and legal entities
- Sales tax calculation and reporting
- Operational reporting
Here are some of the limitations :
- You can use sales tax functionality only with legal entities , not with financial dimensions .
To help maintain referential integrity of the data , financial dimensions can rarely be deleted . If you try to delete a financial dimension , the following criteria are evaluated :
- Is the financial dimension used in any active account structure , advanced rule structure , or financial dimension set ?
- Is the financial dimension part of a default financial dimension integration format ?
- Has the financial dimension been set up as a default dimension ?
If any of the criteria are met , you can &apos;t delete the financial dimension .
If records already exist for the dimension , the master records are updated when you turn the feature on . However , existing documents and transactions aren &apos;t updated .
You can set up derived values on the dimensions page .
2 . Add the segments that should be derived . Each segment appears as a column .
# # # Overriding existing values with derived dimensions
Derived dimensions with this setting do not automatically replace the existing default dimensions values when dimension values are defaulted . Dimension values will only be overridden when you enter a new dimension value on a page and there are existing derived values for that dimension on the page .
In all cases , the account value and all dimensions values will still be validated against the account structures after the derived dimensions values have been applied . If you use derived dimensions and they fail validation when used on a page , you must change the derived dimensions values on the derived dimensions page before you can use them in transactions .
# # # Derived dimensions and entities
You can set up the derived dimensions segments and values by using entities .
- The Derived dimensions entity sets up the driving dimensions and the segments that are used for those dimensions .
- The Derived dimensions value entity lets you import the values that should be derived for each driving dimension .
When you use an entity to import data , if that entity imports dimensions , the derived dimension rules are applied during the import unless the entity specifically overrides those dimensions .

This article gives an overview of the 125 percent reducing balance method of depreciation .
# # Example of 125 % reducing balance depreciation
title : Reverse charge VAT
To apply the reverse charge , you must complete the following setup .
# # Set up sales tax codes
We recommend that you use separate sales tax codes for sales operations and purchase operations .
You must assign this negative sales tax code to an item sales tax group and then assign that item sales tax group to the items that are subject to the reverse charge VAT . &lt; / li &gt;
# # Set up sales tax groups and item sales tax groups
We recommend that you use separate sales tax groups for sales operations and purchase operations .
# # Set up reverse charge groups
# # Set up reverse charge rules
# # Set up default parameters
# # Reverse charge on a sales invoice
For sales under the Reverse Charge schema , the seller doesn &apos;t charge VAT . Instead , the invoice indicates both the items that are subject to the reverse charge VAT and the total amount of the reverse charge VAT .
# # Reverse charge on a purchase invoice
For purchases under the Reverse Charge schema , the purchaser who receives the invoice that has the reverse charge acts as a buyer and a seller for VAT accounting purposes .

&gt; This document uses the following Power BI terminology :
# # Finance and Operations setup
On the * * Main accounts * * page , you must define your main account so that one of the following types is assigned to it :
- Purchase cube
- Sales cube
The following comparison chart will help differentiate the two options :
- Trial balance
- Income statement by region
- Income statement actual vs. budget
- Income statement with variances
- 12-month trend income statement
- Expenses three-year trend
- Expenses by vendor
- Sales by customer
By default , when you first open workspaces , the active legal entity is used as the report-level filter . Depending on their security , users might be able to add other legal entities or change the default legal entity that is selected in the filter .
The default financial statements don &apos;t include any financial dimensions but are focused only on the main account . Support for financial dimensions will be available in future releases , when the reports become editable . Organizations will then be able to filter on financial dimension values .
The following dimensions are used on the default reports . None of these dimensions are financial dimensions .
- Vendor group
- Customer group
- State / province
You can continue to use the * * Drill up * * button to return to the highest level of summarization for the rows .
To see the transaction details behind the summarized balances , you can select some amounts to drill back into Financial and Operations .
The following filters from the financial statements are sent to the ASE , so that the ASE shows the transactions that are aggregated :
Required fields for filtering :
- Fiscal calendar
- Main account ID
Optional fields for filtering :
Currently , the financial statements don &apos;t support the organizational hierarchies , which let you aggregate data .
The financial statement visuals have a limit on the number of rows that can be shown . Currently , the limit is set to 30,000 . If you exceed this limit , the visual will have a warning symbol to notify you about this situation .
If the maximum is exceeded , the totals that appear on the financial statement will be incorrect , because not all the rows were loaded into the visual .
Power BI doesn &apos;t provide an option to hide and show empty rows . If a row doesn &apos;t have any data , the row won &apos;t appear in the visual .

title : Set up consignment
This topic explains how to use the inbound consignment inventory processes .
# # Overview of the consignment process
In this example scenario , company USMF has a consignment agreement with vendor US-104 for the raw material M9211CI .
2 . The vendor gets informed about the expected delivery . This can happen in one of three ways :
- Someone working at USMF sends the order information to the vendor .
3 . The inventory is delivered from US-104 to USMF .
USMF carries out additional periodic processes :
- The physical movement of the vendor-owned inventory between different warehouses is processed using a transfer journal .
# # Inventory ownership change journal
The process of changing the owner of the inventory from the vendor to the receiving legal entity is done using an Inventory ownership change journal . No expected inventory transactions are created for the journal . The only inventory transactions created are those that relate to a posted journal . When the journal is posted :
It ’ s not possible to update the quantity on consignment purchase order lines after the order has been created .
# # Vendor collaboration in consignment processes
The vendor collaboration interface has three pages related to the inbound consignment process :

&#91; Product receipt against purchase orders &#93; ( product-receipt-against-purchase-orders.md )
title : Inventory lookup in the point of sale ( POS )
# Inventory lookup in the point of sale ( POS )
An accurate real-time view of inventory across an organization helps store associates provide timely , superior customer service . The moment that matters most is the moment when the customer is ready to make a purchase decision . It &apos;s important that cashiers in the store have real-time inventory information at their fingertips , so that they can accurately promise product delivery and pickup .
# # Locations that inventory availability information is shown for
The list of locations includes two types of entities :
# # Opening the Dimension based matrix view to show all variants
&gt; In the preceding illustration , the display order of the dimensions is alphabetic , because the display order of dimensions wasn &apos;t configured for the selected product .
You can also change the pivot for dimensions by selecting the new dimension to use .
&gt; In the preceding illustrations , the display order of the dimensions for the selected product is custom ( non-alphabetic ) . It &apos;s based on the dimension display order that is set in the back office .
- Sell an individual product variant to a customer by using cash and carry , in-store pickup , or shipment to an address .
- Provide the customer with ATP information for an individual product variant at a specific location .
The following table provides more information about the additional actions that are available .
&#124; Availability &#124; Show the ATP information for the selected variant combination for the selected location . &#124;
The cost roll-up and sales price calculations are known as bill of materials ( BOM ) calculations , and you initiate them from the Calculations page . This topic provides information about BOM calculations .
- Calculate the cost of a manufactured item , and generate an associated item cost record within a costing version .
- Calculate the sales price of a manufactured item , and generate an associated item sales price record within a costing version .
- The calculation date or site can be mandated by the costing version , or user-specified values can be set when the date or site isn &apos;t mandated in the costing version .
Other variations in BOM calculations reflect the costing type and restrictions of the costing version :
# # # BOM calculations that use standard costs
- The source of cost contributions for purchased items must be based on standard costs . In other words , BOM calculations must use the item cost records within the specified costing version , or within the fallback that contains standard costs .
- To help guarantee accurate and consistent calculation of standard costs , the explosion mode must be single-level .
# # # BOM calculations that use planned costs
# # BOM calculations that use the fallback principle
The following situations illustrate two uses of the fallback principle :
# # BOM calculation of a suggested sales price
- An order-specific BOM calculation always uses the active cost records for components , cost categories , and indirect cost calculation formulas .

title : Purchase requisition workflow
You can configure your workflow to represent the business process for purchase requisitions in your organization . When you configure your purchase requisition workflow process , consider the following questions :
- What expenditures must be reviewed ?
- What expenditures can be automatically approved ?
- Who is required to review and approve expenditure requests ? What role are these users assigned to ?
- What process must be followed if a reviewer is not available ?
The following examples illustrate two ways that you can configure a workflow for purchase requisitions .
The following illustration shows how a purchase requisition can flow through the workflow review process as a single document . The lines on the purchase requisition aren &apos;t routed individually . The following roles are included in the workflow process for this example :
In this example , the workflow process for the purchase requisition includes the following steps :
1 . The preparer submits a purchase requisition for review .
# # Example 2 : Route the individual purchase requisition lines for review
In this example , a worker enters a request for posters and T-shirts for a marketing campaign . The cost of the posters is split between the Marketing department and the Sales department . If the cost of the posters or T-shirts exceeds the signing limit authority for department managers , the purchase requisition must also be reviewed by the group manager .
The following roles are included in the workflow process for this example :
In this example , the workflow process for the purchase requisition lines includes the following steps :
1 . The preparer submits a purchase requisition for review . Each line is routed to the reviewer who is configured to receive it in the workflow process .
# # Configuring a workflow for purchase requisitions
The participants or the reviewers that a task is assigned to in a workflow can be members of a particular user group , users who have a particular security role , users who are associated with the submitter in a managerial hierarchy , or named users or users who have specific expenditure responsibilities .
# # # Purchase requisition expenditure reviewers
You can define one or more expenditure reviewer configurations and then select a configuration when you create a workflow . You can configure the expenditure reviewer values for every legal entity in your organization . After you define the expenditure reviewer configurations , you assign a configuration to your workflow task .

title : Reimburse customers
This article explains how to create reimbursement transactions for a group of customers . If a customer has a credit balance , you can reimburse the customer for the amount of the balance .
When you create reimbursement transactions , a vendor invoice is created for the amount of the credit balance . The reimbursement process removes the credit balance for the customer account and creates a balance due for the vendor account that corresponds to the customer .
2 . Follow one of these steps :
The credit amounts are transferred to the vendor accounts of the customers and are processed as ordinary payments . If a customer doesn &apos;t have a vendor account , a one-time vendor account is automatically created for the customer .
4 . In Accounts payable , create a payment for the vendor invoices that were created by the reimbursement process .

title : Project contracts
The type of project that you create for a project contract determines the method that is used to invoice project customers . You can change a project contract and the related project , but you can &apos;t change the project type .
By using a project contract , you can invoice one or more projects at the same time . The project contract also helps guarantee a consistent invoicing procedure for every subproject in a project structure .
Every project that will be invoiced must be associated with a project contract . The settings for a project contract apply to all projects and subprojects that are associated with that project contract .
A project contract can specify one or more sources of funding . Therefore , you can split the billing among multiple funders , set up funding limits so that funding sources are not billed more than a specified amount , and configure funding rules for charging expenditures .
# # Funding for project contracts
Some project contracts specify that multiple parties share the responsibility for funding the project costs . Here are some examples :
- A large customer that has multiple divisions requests that funding of a project be split by division .
- A road project is co-funded by two municipalities .
Here are some steps that you can take to make it easier to split the billing among multiple funding sources :
- Specify that all transactions that are entered for a project use the same sales currency as the project contract .
- Set up funding limits , so that a funding source isn &apos;t invoiced more than a specified amount toward a project .
- Select optional start and end dates to define the period when each funding rule is valid .
- Specify the percentage that each funding source is responsible for .
- Specify which funding source is responsible for rounding differences that are caused by funding allocation calculations .
- Set up rules that determine how project costs are invoiced to external customers and charged to internal organizations .
- Record transactions in an on-hold funding account until additional funding can be obtained , or until you decide to bear the costs internally .
# # # Example : Multiple funding sources ( simple )
The following table provides scenarios for managing funding allocation among multiple funding sources . These scenarios are based on the following assumptions :
- Priority settings are factored into the allocation of funds before other funding rule criteria are applied .
- No date range has been specified to define the period d when the funding rule is valid .
# # # Example : Multiple funding sources ( complex )
You have three funding sources that you want to use in the following order :
1 . Use funding source 2 and funding source 3 equally until funding source 2 is exhausted .
2 . Continue to use funding source 3 until it is exhausted .
3 . Use funding source 1 after funding source 3 is exhausted .
- Set up funding limits for funding source 2 and funding source 3 , for their respective amounts .
- Create the following funding rules :
The following table examines this scenario in more detail .
You can set up the following types of billing rules :
When you are ready to invoice the customer , the amount to invoice for the project is calculated based on the billing rules , and a project invoice proposal is generated .
The following sections provide examples that show how to set up and manage billing rules for a project .
# # # Example : Create a billing rule that is based on the number of units delivered
Your organization enters into an agreement to provide a total of five training sessions to a customer ’ s employees at a cost of 10,000 per training session . You invoice the customer after each training session .
When you set up the billing rules for the contract , you use the following values :
- The unit price is 10,000 per training session .
- The total number of units is five training sessions .
When you have completed one training session , you can create an invoice for 10,000 , for the first unit that was delivered , and send the invoice to the customer .
- * * Development * * – Cost of 15,000 and revenue of 20,000
- * * Installation * * – Cost of 5,000 and revenue of 10,000
When you create a customer invoice for the first time , the invoice amount is automatically calculated based on the following information :
- You create an invoice for 8,667 and send it to the customer .
# # # Example : Create a billing rule that is based on agreed-upon milestones
- Milestone 1 : Collect consumer data – March 31
- Milestone 3 : Present a product viability proposal – May 31
The customer agrees to pay your organization 10,000 for the first milestone , 20,000 for the second milestone , and 20,000 for the third milestone .
When you set up the project contract , you agree to bill the customer based on the milestone that has been completed . The billing rule setup includes the following steps :
- Define the project milestones .
- Define the amount to invoice the customer when each milestone is completed .
# # # Example : Create a billing rule that is based on services plus a management fee
When you set up the project contract , create a billing rule to add a 10 percent management fee to the consulting hours that are charged to the project .
- 200 hours at 100 per hour = 20,000
- 10 percent management fee = 2,000
If fees are taxable to a customer , and you select a sales tax group in the project contract , the sales tax group is automatically entered in a billing rule for fees .
# # # Example : Create a billing rule for the value of time and materials
When you set up the project contract , you agree to bill the customer each month for time and materials on the project . You create a billing rule that includes the following information :
- The contract period is six months .
- Consulting time is calculated at a rate of 150 per hour .
- Office supplies are invoiced at cost , and the total cost for the project must not exceed 10,000 .
- You create a customer invoice at the end of each calendar month during the project .
title : Partial shipment of a transport load
# Partial shipment of a transport load
The setup for partial shipment of loads consists of the following two procedures .
# # # Set the loading strategy
You must enable partial loading by setting the loading strategy . You can set the loading strategy after you &apos;ve created a load .
# # # Create a menu item for loading of transport loads
You must create a new menu item that enables transport loads to be loaded . A transport load lets you group work lines from one load or multiple loads . Everything that is added to the transport load can then be shipped by using a mobile scanner .
# # Confirm shipment of a transport load from the client
This setup lets you confirm a transport load that includes a full load or a partially loaded load to be shipped .

# Row definitions in financial report designer
# # Create a row definition
2 . Double-click the name of the row definition to open .
# # Contents of a row definition
A row definition can contain up to 20,000 financial dimension rows and can include the following information :
&gt; You can set up a row definition to pull data from the financial dimensions system every time that the report is generated .
- Row totals and formulas that are based on the linked financial data
Usually , each row in a row definition contains one of the following types of information :
- References to the financial dimensions system
- Totals or calculations that are based on the data
There are two methods for entering information in a row definition :

title : Acquire assets through procurement
This topic describes how to set up the integration between Fixed assets and Accounts payable to automatically create fixed assets from purchase orders or vendor invoices , or automatically post acquisition and acquisition adjustment transactions for fixed assets .
- You manually create a fixed asset before you add the fixed asset number to the line on the purchase order or vendor invoice . An acquisition transaction automatically is posted for the asset when you post the vendor invoice . This is the default method .
- You manually create a fixed asset before you add the fixed asset number to the line on the purchase order or vendor invoice . No acquisition transaction is posted for the asset when you post the vendor invoice .
- A fixed asset automatically is created when you post a product receipt or vendor invoice that has the Create a new fixed asset check box selected . An acquisition transaction automatically is posted for the asset when you post the vendor invoice .
- A fixed asset automatically is created when you post a product receipt or vendor invoice that has the Create a new fixed asset check box selected . No acquisition transaction is posted for the asset when you post the vendor invoice .
This topic discusses the details of each method .
# # Methods for manually creating fixed assets
When you post a vendor invoice that has a fixed asset number entered in the lines , if the Allow asset acquisition from Purchasing option is selected in the Fixed assets parameters page , the acquisition is posted automatically , and the status of the asset changes to Open .
If an acquisition cannot be posted , you can either manually enter an acquisition transaction in Fixed assets , or use an acquisition proposal in the Fixed assets journal to create multiple acquisition transactions at the same time .
&gt; If Fixed assets is set up to limit acquisition transaction posting to a specific user group , you must be a member of that user group to post acquisition transactions from invoices .
You can set up the capitalization threshold in the Fixed asset groups page .
The following scenario discusses a full cycle of a Fixed assets and Accounts payable integration . A sample setup is shown and the use of acquisition proposals is also described .
In this scenario , the system is set up as follows :
- Assets are automatically created during product receipt or vendor invoice posting , but Fixed assets is set up to prevent posting acquisition transactions from Accounts payable .
- Accounts are specified in the Account type field for the Fixed asset receipt and Fixed asset issue account types in the Item groups page .
- The capitalization threshold for the computers group ( COMP ) is 1,500 .
The following transactions occurred .

# Reporting tree definitions in financial reports
This article provides information about reporting tree definitions . A reporting tree definition is a report component , or building block , that helps define the structure and hierarchy of your organization .
Before you create a reporting tree , consider the following best practices :
- First determine which reporting dimensions your legal entity or company requires .
- You can use the reporting units that are defined in your financial data system to add reporting units to the reporting tree definition .
# # Create multiple reporting trees
# # Create a reporting tree definition
A reporting tree definition contains the columns that are described in the following table .
&#124; Reporting tree column &#124; Description &#124;
&#124; Row link &#124; The row link to use for the reporting unit . Row links are defined for the row definition to identify the financial dimensions to link to . &#124;
&#124; External link &#124; The row link to use for this reporting unit . Row links are defined for the row definition to identify the report to link to . &#124;
&#124; Page Options &#124; This column controls whether the details for the reporting unit are suppressed when the report is viewed or printed . &#124;
&#124; Unit Security &#124; Restrictions on the users and groups that can access the information for the reporting unit . &#124;
&#124; Additional Text &#124; Text that is included on the report . &#124;
To create a reporting tree definition , follow these steps .
1 . Open Report Designer .
# # # Open an existing reporting tree definition
2 . Double-click a name in the reporting tree list to open it .
# # # Roll up data in a reporting tree
When you use a reporting tree , you can aggregate amounts from child reporting units at the level of the parent reporting unit . This aggregation is known as rolling up the data . The following rules are used to roll up amounts to parent units in a reporting tree :
&gt; If you specify dimensions for both child units and parent units , you might cause duplication of data in the report .
# # # Manage reporting units
# # # Reporting unit structure
The following types of reporting units are used in financial reporting :
- A detail unit draws information directly from the financial data , from an Excel worksheet , or from another financial reporting worksheet .
- A summary unit summarizes data from lower-level units .
# # # Organize reporting units
You can rearrange the organizational structure of a reporting tree definition by moving reporting units in the graphical view . You can also promote reporting units to a higher level in the reporting tree or demote them to a lower level .
1 . In Report Designer , open the reporting tree definition to modify .
# # # Add text about a reporting unit
4 . To add more text entries for this reporting unit , enter the text in an empty row .
# # # Remove additional text from a reporting unit
# # # Restrict access to a reporting unit
You can prevent certain users and groups from accessing a reporting unit . You can also define restrictions so that they apply to child reporting units of the reporting unit .
# # # Remove access to a reporting unit

title : Cost entries
This article provides information about cost entries and when they are created . A cost entry is a record that registers the quantity and cost of a given event .
Cost entries are aggregations of inventory transactions that are recorded on active financial inventory dimensions .
# # # Example 1 : No cost entries are created
# # # Example 2 : Cost entries are created
# # # Example 3 : One cost entry is created
- A product receipt event is registered for item A. One hundred pieces are received at a unit cost of 10.00 USD .
- A few days later , a miscellaneous charge of 15.00 USD to cover the transportation cost is registered on the purchase order .
Fixed assets can be integrated with General ledger , Inventory management , Accounts receivable , and Accounts payable . You can also set up Fixed assets so that it is integrated with purchase orders .
In the inventory journal for fixed assets , you can enter the acquisition of fixed assets that the legal entity has produced or constructed for itself . You can then transfer inventory items to fixed assets either as an acquisition or as part of an acquisition .
If you use specific receipt and issue accounts on item groups for fixed assets , you can use the same inventory item both for internal purchases and as stock for resale .
- The invoice line contains an existing fixed asset for internal purposes .
The accounts that fixed asset transactions are posted to depend on two factors : whether the assets are purchased or constructed by the legal entity , and the transaction type of the asset .
If the book includes a derived book , the derived book transaction is created when you post the customer invoice .
If the book includes a derived book , the derived book transaction is created when you post the vendor invoice .
# # Project management and accounting
You can also designate a fixed asset that you ’ re creating or manufacturing as part of an estimate project . At the end of an estimate project , you can automatically post an asset acquisition transaction .
Vendor rebates help companies better manage their supplier rebate programs by automating tasks that are required in order to administer , track , and claim rebates that are earned .
This topic provides an overview of the most common tasks that you might want to perform when you work with vendor rebates . The overview covers the following tasks :
- Review details of a rebate agreement .
- Identify orders that qualify for rebates , and generate rebate claims .
- Review and approve claims .
- Negotiate vendor price , discount , and rebate agreements .
- Manage staff that processes rebate claims and collects payments .
- Order inventory at the best possible prices .
People in these positions are looking for ways to achieve various goals . Here are some examples :
- Reduce the administrative burden and errors that are associated with monitoring promotion performance and processing claims .
- Improve cash flow forecasts by accruing for future receivables .
- Have a quantified basis for ongoing and future negotiations with vendors about rebates .
# # Review details of a vendor rebate agreement
On the * * Vendor rebate agreements * * page , you can view details about the negotiated conditions of a vendor agreement .
On the agreement lines , you can specify the vendor rebate agreement in more detail .
# # Identify orders that qualify for rebates , and generate rebate claims
# # # View details of rebates that are applied to a purchase order line per the vendor rebate agreement
# # Review and approve claims
# # # Approve claims , and view postings and invoice details
2 . Close the rebate claim .
A Rebate accrual journal is posted for the claim amount . This posting debits the Accrued Vendor Rebates Receivable account for the expected vendor credit and credits the interim Accrued Vendor Rebates Received account for the expected gain .
The message bars and the fact that the status is changed to * * Completed * * indicate that the following events have occurred :
- A Rebate accrual journal posting has reversed the previous interim amounts on the accrual receivable and expense accounts .
- A vendor invoice ( credit note ) for the rebate amount has been created .
- When the vendor invoice is posted , either automatically or manually , the vendor ’ s Payable account has been debited , and the Discounts and Allowances Received account has been credited .
The invoice line specifies the details of the vendor invoice for the * * Commissions and Rebates * * procurement category .
The process for handling vendor rebates involves multiple manual tracking tasks that are often tedious . By automating these tasks , the vendor rebate management feature can help you move through the following processes :
- Accruing the expected receivable and interim gain in the general ledger

title : Lean manufacturing overview
Lean manufacturing offers tools that you can use to model lean operations . These tools support and promote the following concepts and business activities :
- Create a lean manufacturing foundation by modeling manufacturing and logistics processes as production flows .
- Implement a lean pull system by using kanbans to signal demand requirements .
- Monitor and maintain kanban jobs .
To create a lean manufacturing foundation , model the manufacturing and logistics processes as production flows . This activity consists of the following tasks :
2 . Define a production flow as a sequence of activities that describes the flow of material . A transfer activity defines the movement of a product or products from one location to another . A process activity defines a value-added operation that is applied to a product .
# # Using kanbans to signal demand requirements
When kanbans are created , one or more kanban jobs are generated based on the kanban flow activities that are defined in the kanban rules .
# # Monitoring and maintaining kanban jobs
Lean manufacturing provides visibility into the current status of manufacturing and logistics activities that are governed by the kanban rules . As a result , you can plan and prioritize the following tasks :
- Gain an overview of the current kanban job schedule .
- Plan and reschedule kanban jobs .
- Track and register the status of kanban jobs .
Kanban jobs are fully integrated with current processes for inventory transactions in Finance and Operations .
- You can perform picking activities to replenish material that is used to fulfill the requirements of kanban jobs .
- You can register the picking and transfer activities in inventory by scanning bar codes .
In addition , lean manufacturing supports the purchasing and invoicing processes for services that are referenced by subcontracted activities .
- You can assign purchase agreement lines and services to subcontracted activities .
- You can create periodic purchase orders and receipt advices to support the purchase and invoicing of the services .

title : Prepare to maintain standard costs for manufactured items
This topic describes the steps for preparing to maintain costs for manufactured items . The steps for manufactured items differ slightly from the steps for purchased items .
Policies that are assigned to manufactured items can affect the cost calculations for the parent manufactured items . To prepare to maintain costs for manufactured items , follow these steps .
1 . Assign an item model group to the manufactured item .
The item model group identifies that standard costs will be used .
2 . Assign an item group to the manufactured item .
The item group contains ledger accounts that apply to the manufactured item . The ledger accounts for a manufactured item that has a standard cost inventory model include several production variances , the cost change variance , and the inventory cost revaluation .
3 . Assign the inventory unit of measure to the item .
The item &apos;s costs are always expressed in the item &apos;s inventory unit of measure .
4 . Don &apos;t assign a cost group to the manufactured item unless the item will be treated as a purchased item .
6 . If the manufactured item has constant costs , assign a standard order quantity to it .
The standard order quantity is an accounting lot size for amortizing constant costs . Examples of constant costs include setup times in routing operations and a constant component quantity in the BOM .
7 . Define the BOM for the manufactured item .
One or more BOM versions can be defined for the manufactured item . Verify that the versions that you want have been marked as approved and active , and that they have the effective dates that you want . The BOM version can be company-wide or site-specific .
8 . Define the routing for the manufactured item .
One or more route versions can be defined for the manufactured item . Verify that the versions that you want have been marked as approved and active , and that they have the effective dates that you want . The route version must be site-specific .
If you want to use routing information for costing purposes , additional preparation steps are required . For example , the cost categories that are assigned to routing operations must be correct and completed .

title : Purchase agreements
This article provides information about purchase agreements . A purchase agreement is a contract that commits an organization to buy a specified quantity or amount by using multiple purchase orders over time . In exchange for this commitment , the buyer receives special prices and discounts .
Each line in a purchase agreement is a commitment to buy something . You can use lines from multiple purchase orders ( POs ) to fulfill the commitment . There are four types of commitments :
# # Pricing terms for purchase agreements
# # Policies for purchase agreements
The following policies affect the way that the link between a purchase agreement commitment and the corresponding PO lines works :
# # Fulfillment calculations for purchase agreements
The * * Fulfillment * * area shows the remaining amount or quantity that is required to fulfill the commitment .
The * * Agreement * * area shows the total quantity or the total amount that the sales agreement line is valid for .
You can access the PO lines and the invoice lines that contribute to the fulfillment calculation by selecting the * * Related information * * action on the lines or on the header of a purchase agreement .
# # Confirmations and version history for purchase agreements
You can select a purchase agreement only when you &apos;re creating a PO . You can &apos;t select a purchase agreement after the PO has been created .
# # Purchase agreements and intercompany trade
Intercompany trading relationships can be created between vendor accounts and customer accounts that are in different legal entities . When a sales order or PO is created for one of the parties , an intercompany order chain is created . In the order chain , the sales order and PO are created in the appropriate legal entities .
You can create a purchase agreement or sales agreement for one of the intercompany trading parties . You can then generate the corresponding sales agreement or purchase agreement for the other intercompany trading party in the other legal entity .
If you create an intercompany PO that uses the intercompany purchase agreement in one legal entity , the corresponding intercompany sales order uses the corresponding intercompany sales agreement in the other legal entity . The fulfillment of the sales agreement commitments and the fulfillment of the purchase agreements are synchronized , just as the intercompany sales order and the intercompany PO are synchronized .
# # Financial dimensions on purchase agreements
You can copy financial dimensions to document headers or to individual lines of a purchase agreement . If you change the dimensions in the agreement header or on the agreement line , the change doesn &apos;t affect any released orders , but it will be reflected on any new orders .

title : Accruing subscriptions
With service subscriptions , you manually accrue revenue in the periods following the date when you invoiced a fee transaction .
Accrual periods are created for the invoice period that you set up for the subscription fee , and the accrual periods are based on the period code of the subscription .
You can accrue and reverse accrued revenue .
# # Reverse accruals of credit amounts
If you credit invoiced subscription amounts , you can use two methods to reverse the accrual amounts :
- You can reverse each accrued revenue transaction individually before you create the credit note proposal for the transaction . This is the manual method . ( manual )
- You can have the accrued amounts reversed on the date where the credit note is posted or on the original posting date of the accrual .
To accrue revenue , make sure that the following data requirements are met :
# # Enable revenue accrual on a subscription group
You must set up an invoicing period code . Unless you want to accrue revenue in the same time intervals as you use for invoicing , you must also set up an accrual period .
The following table provides an overview of which accrual periods can be set up for each invoicing period :
You can control the number of ledger transactions that are created when you post accrued revenue . On subscriptions , define if the ledger transactions should be created as a total or per line .

- Tracking use of the promotional fund , and evaluating program profitability and effectiveness
- High-level budgets and fund allocation
- Planning and analyzing sales promotions
- Managing staff that processes bill-back claims , runs payments based on merchandizing events , and settles short-pays and deductions
People in these roles are looking for ways to achieve these goals :
- Better use marketing promotional funds .
- Improve cash flow forecasts by accruing for future liability .
- Have a quantified basis for ongoing and future negotiations with customers about promotions .

# # Perform sales under the planned merchandising event and generate bill-back claims
When the sales invoice is posted , a corresponding bill-back claim is generated for each invoice line .
The next steps in the process for handling bill-backs are to review , calculate , and approve claims , and then convert them into deductions .
The Bill back workbench is where the promotion agreement owner periodically reviews and processes the claims that are generated . It &apos;s also where the A / R administrator converts the approved claims into deductions or regular payments , depending on the payment method for the claim .
# # # Process claims and pass them to A / R
- The claims have been transferred to the temporary customer balance as deductions .
- The rebate accrual account has been credited to represent the future liability for the customer .
- The rebate expense account has been debited to recognize the cost that was incurred in connection with the sales .
To complete the process , the A / R clerk must now handle the accrual deductions by transferring them to the customers balance as a credit note ( liability ) .
- The customer &apos;s receivable account has been credited .
- The rebate accrual account has been debited .
The collection manager is now responsible for settling the open credit note transaction and the short-pay transaction against each other in the Deduction workbench .

title : Dimension hierarchy
This topic provides information about dimension hierarchies . You use a dimension hierarchy to define the reporting structure , cost policies , and security setup in Cost accounting .
- The reporting structure that fits into the organization &apos;s requirements
- Cost policies
- The security setup
Here is an example of a dimension hierarchy .
A dimension hierarchy can be created for the following types of dimensions :
- Cost element dimensions
- Cost object dimensions
&gt; - You can create multiple dimension hierarchies for the same dimension if different perspectives are required .
&gt; - A dimension hierarchy can be associated with only one dimension .
- A dimension member can be associated more than one time in the hierarchy structure .
- You can put a cost element dimension member in different nodes by assigning a cost behavior to the leaf node .
# # # Dimension classification hierarchy
# # Create and maintain a dimension hierarchy
A dimension hierarchy is created as a tree structure that has node and leaf node relationships .
- A node can ’ t have both subnodes and leaf nodes assigned to it .
- A leaf node can be assigned only at the lowest level in the hierarchy .
A small company has the following organization structure , where Finance and Human resources are departments under Admin , and Assembly and Packaging are departments under Production .
A cost object dimension represents all the cost centers in the organization .
- Cost centers
The cost object dimension that represents all the cost centers can be set up as shown here .
&#124; Cost centers &#124; Description &#124;
A cost element dimension represents all the cost elements in the organization .
- Cost element dimension
The cost element dimension that represents all the cost elements can be set up as shown here .

&#124; Cost behavior &#124; Cost elements &#124; Dimension classification hierarchy &#124;
The dimension hierarchy for the policy can be set up as shown here .
# # # Copy a hierarchy
You can copy a current dimension hierarchy as the starting point for a new dimension hierarchy . This approach can be useful if you want to compare the previous dimension hierarchy to the new dimension hierarchy .
# # # Rearrange nodes in a hierarchy
# # Define dimension hierarchies for reporting
Dimension hierarchies are important for reporting . They let you define the specific structure that fits into the individual organization . The aggregations that are done at the node level of the dimension hierarchy let stakeholders at any level of the organization see data at any level .
Dimension hierarchies are available in the following reporting tools . This approach helps guarantee consistency in the reporting structure .
- Controlled by configuration .
- Provides the option to select specific dimension hierarchies per export definition :
- One cost element dimension hierarchy ( mandatory )
- One cost object dimension hierarchy ( optional )
- One statistical dimension hierarchy ( optional )
- All dimension hierarchies are available .
# # # Update the dimension hierarchies that are used for reporting
Over time , the dimension hierarchies that are used in the previously mentioned reporting tools will have to be updated . You can update dimension hierarchies by refreshing the client .
Updates to dimension hierarchies are picked up every 24 hours by a pre-cached job . After the exported data is updated , the updated dimension hierarchies are available in the following tools :
&gt; To manually trigger an update of the dimension hierarchy cache , you can create a new export to Excel for the dimension hierarchy or hierarchies that must be updated .
# # Define dimension hierarchies for cost policies
Cost accounting consists of multiple policies where detailed rules are defined . You must define one or more dimension hierarchies for the following policies :
- Cost behavior
- Cost distribution
- Cost allocation
A new cost behavior policy is created , and appropriate dimension hierarchies are assigned to the policy , as shown here .
&#124; Policy name &#124; Cost element dimension hierarchy &#124; Cost object dimension hierarchy &#124; Accounting currency &#124;
\ * The variable cost node isn &apos;t required . If a cost isn &apos;t classified as a fixed cost , it must be a variable cost .
The preceding rules show the flexibility that dimension hierarchies provide . By defining high-level rules , you can help minimize maintenance . You can then define detailed rules to fit into a specific business objective .
If the dimension hierarchies that are used in rules are updated , the system automatically brings the updates forward .
If a level of granularity in the rules is no longer required , the rule can be expired .
Any overhead calculation that is run after January 20 , 2017 , no longer considers this rule .
# # Define dimension hierarchies for security setup
Cost accounting data should be made available to all managers who are responsible for a reporting unit . In Cost accounting terminology , a reporting unit is represented as a cost object or a set of cost objects .
- Only one dimension hierarchy can be enabled per cost object dimension in the access list hierarchy .
&gt; Cost accountants should be assigned to the top level of the hierarchy , so that they can see all entries in Cost accounting .
The settings for the access list hierarchy are used to control the data that is shown in the following areas :
- Data in forms that are used to drill through scenarios
- Balances in cards
- Data that is shown in Power BI visualizations

This articles provides examples that show how to set up a reduction key . It includes information about the various reduction key settings and the results of each . You can use a reduction key to define how to reduce forecast requirements .
Example 1 : Percent - reduction key forecast reduction principle
This example shows how a reduction key reduces demand forecast requirements according to the percentages and periods that are defined by the reduction key .
2 . Link the reduction key to the item &apos;s coverage group .
4 . Create a demand forecast of 1,000 pieces per month .
&#124; Month &#124; Number of pieces required &#124;
&#124; May through December &#124; 1,000 &#124;
# # Example 2 : Transactions reduction key forecast reduction principle
This example shows how actual orders that occur during the periods that are defined by the reduction key reduce demand forecast requirements .
&#124; Month &#124; Number of pieces ordered &#124;
If you use the same demand forecast of 1,000 pieces per month , the following requirement quantities are transferred to the master plan .
# # Example 3 : Transactions dynamic period forecast reduction principle
1 . Create a demand forecast for the following dates and quantities .
&#124; Date &#124; Demand forecast &#124;
&#124; January 1 &#124; 1,000 &#124;
&#124; January 12 &#124; 1,000 &#124;
2 . Create sales order lines as follows .
&#124; Date &#124; Sales order quantity &#124;
The forecast will be reduced as follows :
- The first sales order isn &apos;t within any period , so it won &apos;t reduce any forecast .
- The second sales order is between January 1 and January 5 , so it will reduce the forecast for January 1 by 100 .
- The third sales order is between January 5 and January 12 , so it will reduce the forecast for January 5 by 200 .
The following planned order will be created to fulfill the forecast .
&#124; Demand forecast date &#124; Reduced quantity &#124;
Here is a summary of * * Transactions - dynamic period * * reduction :
- Forecast requirements are reduced by the actual order transactions that occur during the dynamic period . The dynamic period covers the current forecast dates and ends at the start of the next forecast .
- This method doesn &apos;t use or require a reduction key .
- If there is no future forecast , forecast requirements from the last forecast that was entered are reduced .
- Time fences are included in the forecast reduction calculation .
- Positive days are included in the forecast reduction calculation .
- If actual order transactions exceed the forecasted requirements , the remaining transactions aren &apos;t forwarded to the next forecast period .

title : Moving average
Moving average is a perpetual costing method based on the average principle , where the costs on inventory issues do not change when the purchase cost does . The difference is capitalized and is based on a proportional calculation . The amount that remains is expensed .
When you use moving average , inventory settlements and inventory marking are not supported . Inventory close does not affect products that have moving average as the inventory model group , and it does not generate any settlements between the transactions .
# # Convert to the moving average costing method
If you are changing your costing method from a standard costing method to a moving average method , you have to complete the following tasks :
3 . Make adjustments to get the quantity and value back into inventory .
The following examples illustrate the effect of using the moving average costing method . There are four configurations :
- Purchase order and proportionally expensed cost difference
- Moving average product and inventory adjustment
- Moving average with production
- Moving average with a backdated transaction
# # Purchase order and proportionally expensed cost difference

It &apos;s important to understand how and where you can improve your onboarding process . The following questions might help you analyze and improve your onboarding process in a systematic way .
- What is your attrition rate ?
- Are new employees successfully completing all of their required onboarding tasks ?
- How long does it take for a new employee to ramp up ?
- How do new employees rank their satisfaction ?
One of the most important pre-onboarding activities is preparing new hires for their first day of work . This can be a stressful time for them . Reduce the stress by creating a checklist and agenda for their first day .
# # # What to include in a checklist
- Dress code , if your company has one .
- Directions to your office .

- Any company handbooks or policies that they should read .
- Send them some company swag , such a t-shirt or mug .
- Send video messages from the team welcoming them to the company .
- Include a personalized welcome from the CEO or another executive .
- Make their first day special .
Don &apos;t make a new hire question their decision to join your company by setting a bad first impression on the first day .
Relationships are key to getting new hires get up to speed . More importantly , they help create a sense of community and belonging in your company .
- Find an expert or champion in your company and make them an onboarding buddy .
- Connect new hires with job-related communities or interest groups . This is a great way to find coaches or mentors .
- Don &apos;t forget about social communities or events that align to your employee &apos;s personal goals .
Set up clear checkpoints and feedback loops between you and your new hire . Create as much opportunity to intervene and course-correct as possible . You want to address issues before they become problems , or worse , lead to attrition .
Schedule a one-on-one meeting with the new employee before their first week is over . This is a great time to discuss expectations , work styles , and career growth .
When you roll out a new onboarding program , pay careful attention to the following questions .
- Are you improving attrition ?
- Is satisfaction increasing among new hires ?

This topic describes the different options that are available for reserving inventory .
You can automatically reserve inventory quantities for a specific sales order . This means that reserved inventory cannot be withdrawn from the warehouse for other orders unless the inventory reservation , or part of the inventory reservation , is canceled .
There are several reasons for reserving inventory :
- First ordered , first delivered , which means that customers get available items in the same order in which they place their orders .
- Shortage of items due to a long or unknown delivery time from the vendor . You might want to make sure that certain customers or orders get delivery of the first-available items .
- Certain customers and certain types of orders have first priority for delivery .
- Items with serial or batch numbers . You can mark certain items that have been or will be delivered to specific orders .
- Specially ordered items that are reserved for certain orders .
- Production orders . For example , you can mark items that are produced for and adjusted to specific orders .
The * * Inventory policies * * section contains the following reservation policies .
# # # # Example for FIFO date-controlled and Backward from ship date
In this example , on-hand inventory for item number A exists for three different batch numbers .

( LINK TO VIDEO THAT WILL BE CREATED )
When setting up your account structures there are some best practices you can follow . However , this is only guidance so a holistic discussion about your business , growth plan , and maintenance plan should be considered as part of that discussion .
- Reuse account structures as much as possible to reduce maintenance across your legal entities .
- For variations across legal entities , consider using advanced rules so that account structures can be reused .
- Do not just put an asterisk for every segment in the account structure and then solely rely on the advanced rules . This can be difficult to manage and often leads to user error during maintenance that can make the system unable to post .

title : Shift and cash drawer management
# Shift and cash drawer management
Retail provides several configuration options and POS operations to support a wide range of end-of-day business processes for the POS . This section describes some typical shift scenarios .
In a &quot; floating till &quot; shift , the shift and cash drawer can be moved from one register to another . Although a register can have only one active shift per cash drawer , shifts can be suspended and then resumed later or on a different register .
&gt; Only one shared shift can be open at a time in each store . Shared shifts and stand-alone shifts can be used in the same store .
# # # Declare start amount
* Float entries * are non-sales transactions that are performed in an active shift to increase the amount of cash in the cash drawer . A typical example of a float entry is a transaction to add additional change to the drawer when it &apos;s running low .
Suspension of a shift prevents any new transactions or changes to the shift until it &apos;s resumed .
This operation lets users resume a previously suspended shift on any register that doesn &apos;t already have an active shift .
This operation is performed to specify the total amount of money that is currently in the cash drawer . Users most often perform this operation before they close a shift . The specified amount is compared against the expected shift amount to calculate the overage / shortage amount .
Like safe drops , bank drops are done on active shifts . This operation removes money from the shift to prepare for the bank deposit .
# # # Blind close shift
Blind-closed shifts are often used to free up a register for a new user or shift without first having to fully count , reconcile , and close the shift .
This operation generates and prints an X report for the current active shift .
This operation reprints the last Z report that the system generated when a shift was closed .
The following POS permissions affect what a user can and can &apos;t do in various scenarios :
This setup helps guarantee that back-office statements include the same transactions as shifts in the POS , and that the data is summarized by that shift .

- Set up a payment method for cash payments in a retail store .
# # # Set up retail parameters for cash operations
3 . Activate the individual parameters listed below to aggregate the transactions that are associated with a statement line when you post the statement :
# # # Set up a payment method for cash payments in a retail store
Use the following procedure to set up a payment method for cash payments in a retail store .
&gt; You must set up offset accounts for both the cash tender payment method and the remove tender or float entry payment method for a store . This creates balanced general ledger entries for remove tender or float entry transactions .
title : General ledger account balances
This article explains two ways to view general ledger account balances - the Trial balance list page and financial reports . It also discusses how to update dimension set balances .
There are a variety of ways users can view balances in the general ledger . Some of the most common options are :
- Voucher transactions
- Ledger reports
The most common ways are the trial balance list page and financial reports .
When a user changes the parameters the balances are refreshed . The user can also pick what dimension set they want to view balances for and whether each of the dimensions show in separate columns .
Users can drill down on the balances to view the transactions that make up the balance .
title : Monitor service activities
The * * Dispatch board * * form provides an at-a-glance status update for the various scheduled service activities , and tools for tracking the general flow of service orders in your company .
If you must redistribute service activity assignments , you can move the graphical representation of a service activity to assign it to a different employee or a different date and time .
# # Open the Dispatch board form
You can use flex groups to set the following rules and principles for a worker &apos;s flexible hours :
- Rules for flex regulations
- Principle for calculating the worker &apos;s flex balance
# # Set up flexible working hours in flex groups
# # Associate workers with flex groups
# # Rules for flex regulations
If a worker &apos;s allowed flex minimum is exceeded ( that is , if the number of hours in the flex account is below the specified minimum ) , you can use these methods to adjust the worker &apos;s flex balance by making a flex regulation :
- The worker &apos;s flex account can be adjusted to the specified allowed minimum , but without deducting the worker &apos;s pay for the number of hours that the flex account is below the allowed minimum .
- The worker &apos;s pay can be deducted for the number of hours that the flex account is below the allowed minimum . This deduction is done by generating pay items for a specific pay type that have a negative or positive pay unit .
- The worker &apos;s flex account can be adjusted back to the specified allowed maximum , but without compensating the worker &apos;s pay for the number of hours that the worker worked above the allowed maximum .
- The number of hours that the worker worked above the allowed maximum can be converted to pay . This conversion is done by generating pay items for a specific pay type .
You can adjust a flex balance at the following times :
# # Principle for calculating a worker &apos;s flex balance
The following two principles can be used :
# # # Scenario 1 : Adjusting a worker &apos;s pay and flex account because the allowed flex minimum is exceeded
A worker who can work flexible hours has a negative flex account .
The worker is associated with a flex group that has the following configuration :
As the difference between the worker &apos;s flex account and his allowed flex minimum indicates , the worker has exceeded his allowed flex minimum by 3.5 hours .
# # # Scenario 2 : Adjusting a worker &apos;s pay and flex account because the allowed flex maximum is exceeded
A worker who can work flexible hours has a positive flex account .
As the difference between the worker &apos;s flex account and her allowed flex maximum indicates , the worker has exceeded her allowed flex maximum by 4.0 hours .
- The worker &apos;s flex account is adjusted by -4.0 hours . Therefore , the flex balance of 6.0 hours becomes adjusted to the worker &apos;s allowed flex maximum of 2.0 hours .
# # # Scenario 3 : Managing a worker &apos;s flex balance based on pay types
This scenario uses the following flex profile that represents a workday .
&#124; Profile type &#124; Start &#124; End &#124;
&#124; Pay type &#124; Description &#124;
Next , follow these steps to set up a pay type and add lines of the new type to a pay profile .
When you transfer the registrations , you will notice that the amount of Flex + time is changed from 6.0 hours to 8.0 hours .
This change occurs after the transfer because the flexible hours have been calculated based on pay types instead of time . The following table shows how the eight hours are calculated .
title : Sales tax overview
This topic provides an overview of the sales tax system . It explains the elements of the sales tax setup and how they work together .
The following diagram shows the entities of the tax setup and how they are related .
For every sales tax that a company must account for , a sales tax code must be defined . A sales tax code stores the tax rates and calculation rules for the sales tax .
Every sales tax code must also be linked to a ledger posting group . A ledger posting group specifies the main accounts that amounts for the sales tax codes will be posted to .
The following table describes the entities and the sequence for the tax setup .
&#124; Setup activity &#124; Required / Optional and description &#124;
# # Sales tax settlement and reporting
&gt; When you select the Conditional sales tax check box , you must set up sales tax codes and sales tax groups , and also create ledger posting groups , to support the functionality . &#124;
You settle sales taxes each month . On June 15 , you create a customer invoice of 10,000 , plus sales tax .
- The sales tax is 25 percent , or 2,500 .
- The invoice payment is due July 30 .
You typically would have to settle and pay 2,500 to the tax authority when the invoice is posted in June , even though you have not received the payment from the customer .
However , if you are using a conditional sales tax , you settle with the tax authority when you receive the payment from the customer on July 30 .
title : Upgrade budget planning
- Budget plan templates ( Budget planning configuration )
- Scenario constraints ( Budget planning configuration )
- Templates for Budget planning stage rules and templates ( Budget planning process )
- Matrix fields for worksheet templates

5 . Continue to select the same or different layouts for the various budget planning stages , and then save your changes .
# # Additional features to consider in your budgeting process
# # # Budget planning workspace
# # # Copy from Budget Plan allocation
A new allocation method lets you distribute from a parent plan to a child plan without having to go through an intermediate level in the hierarchy . This method is especially useful for customers who previously created financial dimension just for budget distribution and approvals .
# # # Generating budget plans from new budget sources
- Generate Budget Plan from Demand Forecast
- Generate Budget Plan from Supply Forecast
- Generate Budget Plan from Project
- Generate Budget Plan from Budget Register
# # # More complete tracking of amounts
# # # Do not convert currency in aggregation
# # # Looking back from a budget plan to other modules that contributed to the budget

title : Budget planning overview
This article introduces budget planning , and contains information to help you configure budget planning and set up budget planning processes .
You perform budget planning when you &apos;re preparing the budgets that an organization will implement . An organization can configure budget planning , and then set up budget planning processes to meet its policies , procedures , and requirements for budget preparation .
You can use budget planning to perform the following tasks :
- Create budget plans to define the expected revenues and expenditures for a budget cycle .
- Analyze and update budget plans for multiple scenarios .
- Automatically route the budget plans , together with worksheets , justification documents , and other attachments , for review and approval .
- Consolidate multiple budget plans from a lower level of the organization into a single parent budget plan at a higher level of the organization . You can also develop a single budget plan at a higher level of the organization and allocate the budget to lower levels of the organization .
# # # Organization hierarchy for budget planning
# # # Budget planning workflows stages
Budget planning workflows are used together with Budgeting workflows to manage the creation and evolution of budget plans .
# # # Parameters , scenarios , and stages
The initial settings on the * * Budget planning configuration * * page let you create some building blocks for later configuration steps :
Stage allocations are used to automatically allocate budget plan lines during workflow processing . When stage allocations are used , budget plan lines in the destination scenario can be created and modified without the intervention of the budget plan preparer or reviewer .
In the example schema that appears earlier in this article , an allocation is performed to transfer amounts from a budget plan and scenarios in the headquarters Baseline stage to another budget plan and scenarios in the Sales department Estimate stage . The following illustration shows the relevant section of the example schema .
Additionally , in the example schema , an aggregation is done from budget plans and scenarios in the Sales department Submitted stage to a parent plan in the HQ Rollup stage . The following illustration shows the relevant section of the example schema .

title : Search for products and product variants during order entry
# Search for products and product variants during order entry
When you search for products or product variants , it is important to understand how the search feature finds the products that match the text that you enter . The key search rules in delivering search results are :
- Search results will return any matching record , disregarding the field that the search text is entered in .
- The search text needs to be present in the matching record in its full length .
- A match will occur even if the search text is found in the middle of a text string in the matching record . It does not have to appear in the beginning of a text string .
- The search text is treated as a single text string even if it contains white space .
# # Configure the product search
# # # Step 1 : Include all the relevant product and product variant identifiers and dimensions in the search criteria
Until the table is populated , product search will not provide the correct results . If you do not get any search results , make sure that this table is populated .
The table only has to be populated when the search criteria is modified . Newly released products and variants are automatically added to the table . Deleted products and variants are automatically removed from the table .
# # # Step 3 : Enable the lookup for product search on sales and purchase order lines
The following template and underlying tasks are used to synchronize sales quotation headers and lines directly from Sales to Finance and Operations :

title : Sales tax payments and rounding rules
# Sales tax payments and rounding rules
This article explains how the rounding rule setup on the Sales tax authorities works and rounding the sales tax balance during the Settle and post sales tax job .
The below example illustrates how the rounding rule on Sales tax authority works .
The total sales tax for a period shows a credit balance of -98,765.43 . The legal entity collected more sales taxes than it paid . Therefore , the legal entity owes money to the tax authority .
The legal entity wants to use a rounding method that rounds the balance to the nearest 1.00 . The user who is responsible for sales tax accounting performs the following steps .
2 . On the General FastTab , select Normal in the Rounding form field .
3 . In the Round-off field , enter 1.00 .
5 . On the sales tax settlement account , the tax liability amount of 98,765.43 is rounded to 98,765 .
The following table shows how an amount of 98,765.43 is rounded by using each rounding method that is available in the Rounding form field in the Sales tax authorities page .
&gt; If you select Own advantage , the rounding is always to the advantage of the legal entity .

title : Cash flow forecasting
You can use the cash flow forecasting tools to analyze upcoming cash flow and currency requirements , so that you can estimate the company &apos;s future need for cash . To obtain a forecast of the cash flow , you must complete the following tasks :
- Identify and list all the liquidity accounts . Liquidity accounts are the company &apos;s accounts for cash or cash equivalents .
- Configure the behavior for forecasts of transactions that affect the company &apos;s liquidity accounts .
After you &apos;ve completed these tasks , you can calculate and analyze forecasts of the cash flow and upcoming currency requirements .
# # Cash flow forecasting integration
Before you can view cash flow forecasting analytics , you must run the cash flow calculation process . The calculation process will project the future cash impacts of transactions that have been entered .
You can also use batch processing for your cash flow forecasting . To help guarantee that your forecasting analytics are regularly updated , set up a recurring batch process for cash flow forecast calculation .
There are two workspaces that contain cash flow forecasting data . One workspace has data for all companies , and the other workspace has data only for the current company .
- Chief financial officer
- Financial controller
- Accounting manager
- Accounting supervisor
- Accounts payable manager
- Accounts receivable manager

Yes , there are some things that you must set up before you can use the merge batch tools . The following table describes the prerequisites .
&lt; td &gt; Here are the recommended settings for the item :
# # When might I want to merge batches of inventory ?
Here are some examples of scenarios where it might be useful to merge batches :
# # Can I merge batches across sites and legal entities ?
# # Can I merge partial quantities ?
No , you can merge only the full quantity of batches . The batch merge functionality is intended as an inventory feature , not a production feature .
# # What if the batches have different batch attribute values ?
&#124; Batch &#124; Quantity &#124; Attribute &#124; Attribute value &#124;
When you add these batches as source batches , the following values are assigned to the merged batch .
The values and quantities for batches B1 and B4 aren &apos;t included in the weighted average calculation . Therefore , here is how the value for the merged batch is calculated .
# # What if the batches have different batch dates ?
# # What if the dimensions are different on the batches that I want to merge ?
Here is how product dimensions , tracking dimensions , and storage dimensions are handled :
# # How does posting work ?
# # After I merged a catchweight item , why can ’ t I see the catchweight information in the inventory journal ?
You can merge batches of catch-weight items just like all other items . However , the catch-weight information doesn &apos;t appear in the inventory journal . We recommend that you verify the catch-weight information before you transfer the batch merge to the inventory journal .

title : Project invoicing
The project type determines which invoicing procedure should be applied . Only the two external project types , Time and material and Fixed-price , can be invoiced . Time and material projects and Fixed-price projects are always attached to a project contract .
There are three ways to attach Time and material projects and Fixed-price projects to the invoice projects :
# # # Creating invoice proposals
You can create invoice proposals for the following transactions :
- Hours , expenses , and other project transactions
- Credit notes
- Amounts that a customer paid to you before a project is started
# # # Creating customer invoices from invoice proposals
After you create and post an invoice proposal , a customer invoice is automatically created for the transactions that are included in the invoice proposal .
If your organization requires that invoice proposals be reviewed before they are posted , the invoice proposal might need to be approved through the &quot; Review project invoice proposals &quot; workflow before it is posted .
# # # Time and material projects
To invoice a Fixed-price project , you must define a billing schedule and complete the invoicing procedure .
For example , you can set up the following billing schedule :
- 20 percent when the project contract is signed
- 15 percent on second delivery
- 35 percent on final delivery
When the milestone payments are ready to be invoiced , you use the procedure for invoicing on-account amounts .
- Invoice the project &apos;s customer for the item : Set the line property for the item to a chargeable value on the purchase order , and then invoice the customer by using the correct project invoicing method .
When an amount on a customer invoice has a negative value , the invoice is classified as a credit note . When the document is printed , it has the title &quot; Credit note . &quot;
To credit an invoiced amount , you first select the invoiced amount to credit and then create a credit note . You create a credit note by following the same procedure that you would use to generate a customer invoice .

title : Batch processing of alerts
Finance and Operations supports two types of events :
- Events that are triggered by change-based events . These events are also referred to as create / delete and update events .
- Events that are triggered by due dates .
You can set up batch processes for each type of event .
# # Batch processing for change-based events
# # # Frequency for change-based events
# # # # The risks of low batch frequency
If you set up a low frequency for batch processing for change-based events , data that is relevant to the conditions in alert rules might be changed before the batch is processed . Therefore , you might lose alerts .
# # Batch processing for due-date events
# # # Frequency for due-date events
# # # Batch processing window
The processing of alert rules in a company can be stopped for several reasons . These reasons include vacations , system errors , or other issues that prevent the batch jobs from being run for some time .
To prevent due-date alerts from becoming obsolete because the batch job hasn &apos;t been run for several days , you can set up a batch processing window . A batch processing window can be used to prevent a batch job from being run for a specified number of days .

title : Weighted average date
Weighted average date is an inventory model that is based on the weighted average principle . For the weighted average principle , issues from inventory are valued at the average value of the items that are received into inventory for each day in the inventory closing period .
The following formula is used to calculate the weighted average date costing method :
During inventory close , the calculation is performed every day through the closing period , as shown in the following illustration .
- Direct settlement
- Summarized settlement
Settlements are inventory close postings that adjust the issues to the correct weighted average as of the closing date .
- Weighted average date direct settlement when the * * Include physical value * * option isn &apos;t used
- Weighted average date summarized settlement when the * * Include physical value * * option isn &apos;t used
- Weighted average date summarized settlement when the * * Include physical value * * option is used
- Weighted average date when marking is used
# # Weighted average date direct settlement when the Include physical value option isn &apos;t used
The current version uses the same direct settlement principle that was used for weighted average in earlier versions . The system settles directly between receipts and issues . The system uses this direct settlement principle in specific situations :
- One receipt and one or several issues have been posted in the period .
- Only issues have been posted in the period , and the inventory contains on-hand items from a previous closing .
In the following scenario , a financially updated receipt and issue have been posted . During inventory close , the system settles the receipt directly against the issue , and no adjustment to the cost price is required on issue .
The following illustration shows these transactions :
- 1a . Inventory physical receipt is updated for a quantity of 5 at a cost of USD 10.00 each .
- 2a . Inventory physical issue is updated for a quantity of 2 at a cost of USD 10.00 each .
- 2b . Inventory financial issue is updated for a quantity of 2 at a cost of USD 10.00 each .
- 3 . Inventory close is performed by using the direct settlement method to settle the inventory financial receipt to the inventory financial issue .
- If an inventory transaction value is enclosed in parentheses , the inventory transaction is physically posted into inventory .
- If an inventory transaction value isn &apos;t enclosed in parentheses , the inventory transaction is financially posted into inventory .
- Settlements that are performed by inventory close are represented by dashed red arrows that go diagonally from a receipt to an issue .
# # Weighted average date summarized settlement when the Include physical value option isn &apos;t used
In the following scenario , several financially updated receipts and issues have been posted during the period . During inventory close , the system evaluates every day to determine how each day should be treated by closing .
- 1a . Inventory physical receipt is updated for a quantity of 3 at USD 15.00 each .
- 2a . Inventory physical issue for a quantity of 1 at a running average cost of USD 15.00 .
- 2b . Inventory financial issue for a quantity of 1 at a running average cost of USD 15.00 .
The system will use the direct settlement approach for day 1 .
- 3a . Inventory physical issue for a quantity of 1 at a running average cost of USD 15.00
- 3b . Inventory financial issue for a quantity of 1 at a running average cost of USD 15.00
The system will use the direct settlement approach for day 2 .
- 4a . Inventory physical issue for a quantity of 1 at a running average cost of USD 15.00
- 4b . Inventory financial issue for a quantity of 1 at a running average cost of USD 15.00
- 5a . Inventory physical receipt for a quantity of 1 at USD 17.00 each
Inventory close is performed . The direct settlement must be used , because there are multiple receipts that cross multiple days .
- 7a . A weighted average inventory close transaction financial issue is created at for a quantity of 2 at USD 32.00 to summarize the settlements of all inventory financial receipts to date that haven &apos;t been closed .
- 7b . A weighted average inventory close transaction financial receipt is created as the offset to 7a .
- Solid red diagonal arrows show the receipt transactions being settled to the issue transaction that is created by the system .
- The solid green diagonal arrow represents the offsetting system-generated receipt transaction that the originally posted issue transaction is settled to .
# # Weighted average date direct settlement when the Include physical value option is used
The current version uses the same direct settlement principle for weighted average date that is used in earlier versions . The system settles directly between receipts and issues . The system uses this direct settlement principle in specific situations :
- Only issues have been posted in the period , and the inventory contains on-hand inventory from a previous closing .
# # Weighted average date summarized settlement when the Include physical value option is used
Marking is a process that lets you link an issue transaction to a receipt transaction . Marking can occur either before or after a transaction is posted . You can use marking when you want to be sure of the exact cost of the inventory when the transaction is posted or when the inventory close is performed .
- 1a . Inventory physical receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost price of USD 10.00 each .
- 1b . Inventory financial receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost price of USD 10.00 each .
- 2a . Inventory physical receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost price of USD 20.00 each .
- 2b . Inventory financial receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost price of USD 20.00 each .
- 3a . Inventory physical receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost price of USD 25.00 each .
- 4a . Inventory physical receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost price of USD 30.00 each .
- 4b . Inventory financial receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost price of USD 30.00 each .
- 6a . Inventory physical issue for a quantity of 1 at a cost price of USD 21.25 .
title : Default order settings for dimensions and product variants
# Default order settings for dimensions and product variants
There are three types of default order settings for purchases , sales , and inventory . The default order settings for purchases are used when creating :
- Purchase order lines
- Purchase agreement lines
- Request for quotation lines
- Purchase requisition lines
- Consignment replenishment lines
- Planned purchase orders
- Sales order lines
- Sales agreement lines
- Sales quotation lines
- Return order lines and item replacement lines
- Demand forecast lines
The default sales order settings also apply when creating :
- Project item requirements
- Service order item requirements
The default order settings for inventory are used when creating :
- Transfer orders
- Planned transfer orders
The default inventory order settings also apply when creating :
- Quarantine orders
- Quality orders
- Production orders
- BOM lines
- Planned production orders
# # Full definition of a released product
You can define general default order settings and any number of default order setting rules that apply only in certain conditions , such as site or a specific product dimension or product dimensions combination . You can &apos;t define warehouse specific order settings .
# # # Rank in default order settings
# # # Default order settings for released products
# # # Site specific order settings
# # # Specific order settings for product dimension
You can define order settings rules for any active product dimension or combination of active product dimensions . If a product dimension field is left empty , then that the rule applies to all values of the product dimension .
Consider the following example product .
Create the following default order settings to model this scenario .
You can create the following default order settings rules .
As a general guidance , specific rules and rules for dimensions that are more important than other dimensions get higher ranks , while more generic rules get lower ranks .
The rule with rank zero serves as a safety net . If no other rules are hit , then the default order settings from rule zero will be used .
# # # Specific order settings for released product variant
If the rule system for default order settings is too cumbersome , then there is the option of simply defining default order settings for each product variant . The following examples shows how this will look for the product and the cases described above .

This article describes how you can use cycle counting with the warehousing solution that is available in Warehouse management . This article doesn &apos;t apply to the warehousing solution that &apos;s available in Inventory management .
Cycle counting is a warehouse process that you can use to audit on-hand inventory items . The cycle counting process can be described in three steps :
The following table shows the prerequisites that must be in place before you can use cycle counting .
# # Automatically create cycle counting work
There are two ways to schedule recurring creation of cycle counting work : set up cycle counting thresholds or set up cycle counting plans .
- A cycle counting threshold indicates the quantity or percentage limit of inventory items . Cycle counting work is automatically created when the threshold limit is reached .
# # # Create cycle counting work , based on threshold parameters for items
# # # Schedule cycle counting work
# # Create cycle counting work manually
There are several methods for processing cycle counting work by using Finance and Operations on a mobile device :
The following example shows how you can perform spot cycle counting by using a mobile device . The instructions that the worker sees on the device vary , depending on the setup of the menu item for spot cycle counting .
1 . On the mobile device , select the menu item to process spot cycle counting work .
2 . Register the location to perform spot cycle counting for .
4 . Optional : Repeat step 3 for the remaining items in the location , and confirm that no additional items are available for counting .
# # Resolve cycle counting differences
- The counted value differs from the on-hand inventory quantity , and no deviation limits are set .

# # Calculate and allocate the Electricity overhead cost
# # # # Define the cost behavior rule
- Fixed amount 1,000.00
# # # # # Journal
# # # # # Cost entries
# # # Step 2 : Process the cost distribution calculation
Cost distribution is used to redistribute cost from one cost object to one or more other cost objects by applying a relevant allocation base . Cost distribution and cost allocation differ in that cost distribution always occurs at the level of the primary cost element of the original cost .
# # # # Define the cost distribution rule
The following table shows the result when electricity consumption is applied as an allocation base for variable costs .
# # # Step 3 : Process the overhead rate calculation
# # # # Define the overhead rate
Cost object CC001 HR contributes to a set of internal projects . A statistical dimension member that is named HR projects is created to measure the consumed magnitude .
A predetermined cost rate for the cost projects contribution has been defined .
The following table shows the result when the HR projects are applied as an allocation base .
# # # Step 4 : Process the cost allocation calculation
# # # # Define the cost allocation
Cost object CC002 Finance contributes to several cost objects . A statistical dimension member that is named Finance services is created to measure the consumed magnitude .
Cost object CC003 Assembly contributes to several cost objects . A statistical dimension member that is named Assembly services is created to measure the consumed magnitude .
Cost object CC004 Packaging contributes to several cost objects . A statistical dimension member that is named Packaging services is created to measure the consumed magnitude .

title : Operations scheduling
This topic provides information about operations scheduling . You can use operations scheduling to provide a general estimate of the production process over time .
# # Components of operations scheduling
The main components of operations scheduling are the scheduling direction , the capacity of resources , and materials optimization . By using operations scheduling , you can achieve the following goals :
- Control the planning method by scheduling forward or backward from a given date .
- Optimize the use of resources by scheduling productions based on the capacity of the resources . This approach also helps identify when alternative resources should be used .
- Optimize the use of materials by scheduling productions based on the availability of the required materials .
- Schedule and synchronize reference productions . The dates of the reference productions are adjusted when the production order ’ s schedule is changed .
- The product that is planned for production
- The configuration of the product
- The quantities that are involved in the production
- The dates when the production will start and end
- The capacity reservations for the resources that perform the production activities
# # Scheduling direction and date
# # Operations scheduling and master planning
The operations schedule also drives master planning and determines calculations for material requirements . Operations scheduling considers the following information :
- * * Capacity availability * * – Resources that are required for production
- IT admins or developers can easily design mobile workspaces by using the point-and-click workspace designer that is included with the web client .
# # Elements of the mobile app
Navigation in the mobile app consists of four basic concepts : the dashboard , workspaces , pages , and actions .
4 . After you &apos;re on a page , you can perform several actions . Here are some examples :
- View detailed data .

title : Gantt chart for job scheduling
# Gantt chart for job scheduling
The Gantt chart is designed to empower production planners to control and optimize the production plan . The Gantt chart makes the flow of operations transparent and makes it easy to adjust the production schedule while taking into account material or resource shortages . This helps planners make the best use of available resources , minimize work in progress , and optimize throughput times for production orders .
A Gantt chart is a visual representation of scheduled activities within a defined time interval . The activities are scheduled on resources that have capacity defined by a capacity calendar . The following types of activities can be shown in the Gantt chart .
- Jobs from production orders that are job scheduled .
- Job scheduled project activities of type Hour forecasts .
1 . Gantt chart activity
2 . Material shortage icon
3 . Material availability icon
4 . Order delivery date icon
5 . Capacity bar
The time interval for activities has a background shade . Periods with a white shade indicate a time interval with defined capacity on the resource for the activity , whereas periods with a grey shade indicate time intervals with no capacity defined .
A job will appear with a material shortage icon if the schedule start date of the job is later than the material availability date for materials consumed by the job . The material availability date is calculated based on the pegging information in the dynamic master plan . The material shortage icon will for example appear on a job that is consuming a material that is pegged against a purchase order that has a receipt that is later than the planned start date of the job .
# # # Indicator of material availability date
This icon indicates the delivery date for a production order . The icon is only visible in the Order view .
# # Job scheduling in the Gantt chart
# # # Schedule a job as a drag-and-drop interaction
You can re-schedule job within the defined time interval as a drag-and-drop interaction . You can only re-schedule the job on the same resource , and you can only schedule one job at a time .
# # # Schedule a job from the menu
- Forward from scheduling date
- Backward from scheduling date
- Forward from material availability date
It is not possible to schedule a job outside the defined time interval of the Gantt chart . If you do that , the job will be left unscheduled and you will receive the error message , &quot; Could not schedule the job within the loaded time period . &quot;

This article explains how to configure a warehouse . It includes information about how to enable a warehouse layout and warehouse processes .
- You can establish high-priority and low-priority storages areas for optimum placement of goods .
- You can divide your warehouse into zones to accommodate various storage needs , such as temperature requirements , or various turnover rates for items .
- You can group locations by using physical capacity constraint settings .
- You can control how items are stored and picked , based on query-defined rules .
As part of the process for enabling a warehouse layout , you must define warehouse zone groups , and zones , location profiles , location types , and locations .
# # # Location stocking limits , location profiles , and fixed picking locations
You must consider the physical layout of the warehouse , both to determine storage capacities ( location stocking limits and location profiles ) and as part of your attempts to achieve optimal warehouse processes .
If more advanced calculations are required to control the location capacity constraints , the location profile settings can be used . In this case , the weight and volume are considered when capacity calculations are done .
You can create three types of wave templates :
You must specify the wave process methods in each wave template . The methods that are available vary , depending on the wave template type .
If multiple workers must be able to process work for some of your warehouse operations , you might want to use the concept of * staging * for the inventory and separate the work execution into different work classes .
- Cycle count plans
- Cycle count thresholds
- Cycle count work by location
- Cycle count work by item
When you use work templates to create work , the work pool is automatically assigned to the work .
Work pool IDs can also be used to limit the type of work that is directed to a particular warehouse worker , provided that this functionality is configured on the relevant mobile device menu item .

title : Reduce balance depreciation
This article gives an overview of the Reducing balance method of depreciation .
When you set up a fixed asset depreciation profile and select Reducing balance in the Method field in the Depreciation profiles page , the assets that have this depreciation profile assigned to them are depreciated by the same percentage in each depreciation period .
Because an asset will never be fully depreciated based on a percentage calculation , you must select the Full depreciation option to fully depreciate an asset .
The Calendar option updates the depreciation base , which is typically the net book value minus the scrap value , on January 1 of each year . In the reducing balance depreciation example later in this topic , the depreciation base is the numerator in the first expression in the calculations column .
- Yearly posts on December 31 .
- Yearly posts the total amount of the depreciation calculated for the fiscal year as one amount on the last day of the fiscal year .
- Fiscal period posts the total amount of the depreciation calculated for the fiscal year , which is accrued into the fiscal periods that are defined for the fiscal calendar that is selected in the Ledger page , or for the fiscal calendar that is selected for the book for a fixed asset .
# # Example of reducing balance depreciation
Suppose that the fixed asset acquisition price is 11,000 , the scrap value is 1,000 , and the depreciation percentage factor is 30 .

title : Generate consolidated financial statements
# # Single-level and multilevel consolidations across legal entities
The simplest method for consolidating by using Financial reporting is to use reporting trees to aggregate data across companies that have the same chart of accounts and fiscal periods . Here are the high-level steps to consolidate by using a reporting tree .
1 . Create a row definition , and make sure that all appropriate accounts in all companies are included in the rows .
2 . Create a column definition that includes all the columns that are required for the report that you &apos;re creating .
3 . Create a reporting tree that includes a reporting node for each company that you &apos;re using on consolidated reports .
The following illustration shows how you can use a reporting tree definition in Financial reporting to identify each company that you will consolidate .
As the consolidated report in the following illustration shows , when you use the reporting tree together with a report definition , you can view each company separately . The consolidated amounts are shown at the summary level .
You can also create a multilevel reporting tree that includes as many levels as you require . The following illustration shows a multilevel reporting tree definition that has roll-ups by worldwide region .
The following illustration shows a multilevel reporting tree definition that has roll-ups by function .
3 . Optional : Add headers and total columns .
The following illustration shows a column definition in a side-by-side format .
# # Consolidations that use organization structures that are created from legal entities
The following illustration shows the consolidated report .
Whether you use accounts , dimensions , or both , Financial reporting lets you filter out the elimination entries by using the dimension filtering capabilities .
# # # Using the reporting tree definition
&gt; You can apply this ownership percentage to any reporting unit , not just at the company level .
# # # Showing ownership as a separate row on the consolidated report
Another option for minority interest is to show 100 percent of the subsidiary for every line on the report but subtract the non-controlling interest from the net income .
1 . Create a row definition that has multiple links to financial dimensions . There should be one link for each chart of accounts .
2 . Use the reporting unit restriction in the column definition to assign each company to the appropriate column .
# # Different fiscal calendars across multiple legal entities
Different legal entities might have different fiscal calendars but still be required to produce consolidated financial statements . There are two ways to consolidate when different fiscal periods exist across legal entities :
- Create a column definition , and use the period and year to map the appropriate periods for each company .
&#124; Company &#124; Fiscal year &#124; Mapping &#124;
The following illustration shows the options in the report definition that let you select whether the period number or the period end date is used for the consolidation .
# # Consolidations that involve multiple reporting currencies
# # # Currency translation methods
( Exchange rate × Days in effect ) ÷ Days in period
Total of exchange rates ÷ Number of exchange rates
# # # Report designer options for currency translation
In Financial reporting , any report can be shown in any number of reporting currencies . The following fields in the report definition support this capability :
# # # Currency translation adjustment
The currency translation adjustment ( CTA ) is the difference between the rates that are used to calculate the balance sheet accounts and the rate that is used for the income statement accounts . This difference will cause the balance sheet to be out of balance . You can use Financial reporting to calculate the CTA in two ways :
# # # Balance calculation approach
To get correctly translated amounts when currencies are used , Financial reporting uses the following calculation methods for the balances :
title : Reuse product configurations
title : Call center catalogs
# # Use catalogs to drive sales order pricing and promotions
# # Use the source ID to track costs and response rates
# # Configure catalog-specific order and item scripts
# # Configure catalog-specific up-sell and cross-sell items
Up-sell / cross-sell items can also take advantage of the script features to show specific messages that a user will see when the up-sell / cross-sell item is displayed during order entry . Scripts tied to up-sell / cross-sell products configured specifically for a catalog product will only appear when that catalog &apos;s source code is applied in call center order entry .

title : Manage subcontracting work in production
# Manage subcontracting work in production
There are two methods for modeling subcontracting work for production operations . These methods differ in the way that the subcontracting process can be modeled , the way that semi-finished products are represented in the process , and the way that cost control is managed .
- Subcontracting of route operations in production orders or batch orders
- This method supports first in , first out ( FIFO ) or standard cost .
- Semi-finished products are represented by the service product in the process .
- Cost control allocates the costs that are associated with subcontracted work to the material costs .
- Subcontracting of production flow activities in a lean production flow
- The service is a non-stocked service product , and it isn &apos;t part of the BOM .
- This method uses purchase agreements as service agreements .
- This method uses backflush costing .
- This method allows for aggregated and asynchronous procurement . ( Material flow is independent of the procurement process . )
- Cost control allocates subcontracted work in its own cost breakdown block .
A production order can have many operations , and each operation can be allocated to a different vendor . Therefore , an end-to-end production order might trigger multiple purchase orders .
# # Subcontracting of production flow activities
# # # Modeling subcontracting in a production flow
# # Material supply for subcontracted operations
To replenish material at this warehouse , you can use multiple strategies :
- Transfer journals
- Withdrawal kanbans
- Direct purchase to the vendor location
Semi-finished products are the exception to this rule . To transfer semi-finished products , you &apos;re limited to these options :
Typically , the output warehouse and location of a subcontracted resource group are directly allocated to the warehouse and location of the next step of the operation in the route or production flow . This setup helps reduce the amount of job reporting that occurs or the number additional transfer operations that must be modeled .

Select a feature area to learn more about it .
title : Assortment management
The overall product mix of a channel is determined by the published assortments that are assigned to the channel . Therefore , you can configure multiple active assortments per channel .
In the following example , a unique assortment is configured for each store . In this case , only product 1 is available at store 1 , and only product 2 is available at store 2 .
To make product 2 available at store 1 , you can add the product to assortment 1 .
Alternatively , you can add store 1 to assortment 2 .
# # # Excluded products or categories
# # # Global and released products
# # # Dynamic and static assortments
# # # Process assortments batch job
Assortments that are defined in Retail must be processed before they take effect . This processing is done for the following reasons :
Consider the following implementation requirements as you plan and manage assortments for your retail implementation :
title : Info codes and info code groups
# Info codes and info code groups
This article provides an overview about info codes , info code groups , and how to use them .
- Capture additional information at transaction time , such as a flight number or the reason for a return .
- Sell a product as a regular sale , discounted sale , or free product .
- Prompt the cashier to enter a value or select from a list of subcodes when the register drawer is opened without performing a sales operation .
- Link info codes to other info codes or info code groups to gather information about a product or transaction without having to define a separate info code or linked info code for each scenario .
title : Assess sales performance by product
# Assess sales performance by product
- Sales amount
- Gross profit margin
- Margin percentage
title : Fixed asset depreciation
Depreciation is a periodic transaction that typically reduces the value of the fixed asset on the balance sheet , and is charged as an expenditure to a profit and loss account . Therefore , a main account is typically used to credit the periodic depreciation on the balance sheet . An offset account is an account in the profit and loss part of the chart of accounts .
Extraordinary depreciation works independently of basic depreciation . By having extraordinary depreciation as a separate transaction type , you can post and report the extraordinary depreciation separately from the basic depreciation .
You can create an unlimited number of special depreciation allowance records . After you assign those records to an asset group book , they are applied to the asset book .
A special depreciation allowance is entered as either a percentage or a fixed amount . When you post depreciation proposals , special depreciation allowance transactions are posted to the book as transactions that are separate from the depreciation transactions .
You can create shared calendars by using the * * Fiscal calendars * * page in General ledger .

title : Common sources of production variances
# Common sources of production variances
This article explains various typical sources of each type of production variance .
Here are some typical sources of a * * lot size * * variance :
- The good quantity for a production order differs from the calculation quantity that is used in the standard cost calculation . The quantity provides the basis for amortizing constant costs .
- The value of constant costs on the production order differs from the constant costs that are used in the standard cost calculation . The constant costs on the production order can differ for several reasons . For example , the constant costs might reflect the following factors :
- Manual changes to the production bill of materials ( BOM ) or route
- Planned engineering changes to the BOM version or route version that is assigned to the item
Here are some typical sources of a * * production price * * variance :
- The cost category ( and cost category price ) for the reported consumption of a routing operation differs from the cost category that is used in standard cost calculation .
- The active cost for the cost category price differs from the cost category price that is used in standard cost calculation .
Here are some typical sources of a * * production quantity * * variance :
- You over-issue or under-issue a material component .
- You over-report or under-report the time for a routing operation .
Here are some typical sources of a * * production substitution * * variance :
- You issue a material component that isn &apos;t on the production BOM .
- You report an item as consumed but don &apos;t manually add it to the production BOM .
- You manually add an operation to the production route and report that operation as consumed .
- When you create the production order , you select a BOM version that differs from the BOM version that is used in the standard cost calculation .
- When you create the production order , you select a route version that differs from the route version that is used in the standard cost calculation .

Use project forecasting if your organization has an operational perspective , and if it focuses on revenues and costs that are derived from specific transactions . Use project budgeting if your organization focuses more on the financial amounts .
Both project forecasts and project budgets use forecast models to hold the projected transaction amounts .
Each method has its advantages . You should consider the following points before you select a method for your organization .
Project forecasting transactions are based on units and amounts .
You must associate each project forecast with a forecast model . When you enter a forecast transaction , a forecast model is automatically suggested . The forecast model acts as a container for the forecast transactions .
In project budgeting , all original budgets and revisions must be sent to a project workflow for approval . Workflows give you increased control over the process and create a change history record .
Forecast models have a single-layer hierarchy . This means that one project forecast must be associated with one forecast model .

title : Backflush costing
This topic introduces the concept of backflush costing that is used for Lean manufacturing .
To enable costing , you must complete the following setup :
# # # Calculation that is based on the production flow
# # # Calculation that is based on the route
When material is consumed from inventory to WIP , the cost of material is added to WIP at its actual standard cost for a cost group . This operation occurs under the following conditions :
- Kanban issues are posted for kanban picking lines that update inventory .
- Transfer jobs are completed that update inventory on pick but not receipt ( Transfer of material from inventory to WIP ) .
# # Receiving products from the production flow
Products are received from the production flow under the following conditions :
Products that are received from the production flow are deducted from WIP .
Note that material in WIP isn &apos;t visible in inventory on-hand overviews . However , it &apos;s visible in the kanban quantity overviews .
Products in WIP are consumed when the corresponding kanban handling units are emptied . A kanban empty signal doesn &apos;t produce an active costing transaction but will take effect when the next backflush costing is run . Emptied kanban handling units are no longer accounted as on-hand and therefore calculated as consumed within the period .
# # # Automatic empty registration
Scheduled or event kanbans can be set to automatic empty registration in the kanban rule :
2 . Calculate the production flow &apos;s net realized usage over the period .
3 . Clear the WIP from the realized resource consumption and products .
- Transactions are financially split to map the exact consumed quantities .
- Unused quantities in the production flow WIP remain in physically updated status .
* * For production completed quantities of the period : * *
- Financially update the inventory transactions for the completed quantities for the period .
- All direct manufacturing cost is financially updated . All kanban process jobs that are completed during the period are accumulated .
- All indirect cost calculated for the consumed material within the period is calculated and deducted from WIP . The remaining indirect cost is posted as a variance .
5 . Calculate the production variances to standard cost . The variance is calculated per cost group .
title : Weighted average with physical value and marking
# Weighted average with physical value and marking
Weighted average is an inventory model based on the weighted average principle , where issues from inventory are valued at the average value of the items that are received into inventory during the inventory closing period , plus any on-hand inventory from the previous period .
If there is only one receipt , all issues can be settled from it and the virtual transfer will not be created .
When using weighted average , you can mark inventory transactions so that a specific item receipt is settled against a specific issue , instead of using the weighted average rule .
We recommend a monthly inventory closing when you use the weighted average inventory model .
Settlements are inventory close postings that adjust the issues to the correct weighted average as of the closing date . The following examples illustrate the effect of using weighted average with five different configurations :
- Weighted average direct settlement without the Include physical value option
- Weighted average summarized settlement without the Include physical value option
- Weighted average direct settlement with the Include physical value option
- Weighted average summarized settlement with the Include physical value option
- Weighted average with marking
# # Weighted average direct settlement without Include physical value
The direct settlement principle is the same used for weighted average in earlier versions . The system will settle directly between receipts and issues . The system uses this direct settlement principle in certain specific situations :
- One receipt and one or several issues has been posted in the period
In the scenario in the following sections , a financially updated receipt and issue have been posted . During inventory close , the system will settle the receipt directly against the issue , and no adjustment to the cost price is needed on issue . The following transactions are illustrated in the graphic .
- 1a . Inventory physical receipt updated for a quantity of 5 at USD 10.00 each
- 1b . Inventory financial receipt updated for a quantity of 5 at USD 10.00 each
- 2a . Inventory physical issue updated for a quantity of 2 at USD 10.00 each
- 2b . Inventory financial issue updated for a quantity of 2 at USD 10.00 each
The following diagram illustrates this series of transactions with the effects of choosing the Weighted average inventory model and the direct settlement principle without the Include physical value option .
- An inventory transaction value without brackets indicates that the inventory transaction is financially posted into inventory .
- Inventory closings are represented by a red vertical dashed line and the label Inventory Close .
# # Weighted average summarized settlement without the Include physical value option
- 1a . Inventory physical receipt updated for a quantity of 2 at a cost of USD 11.00 each .
- 1b . Inventory financial receipt updated for a quantity of 2 at a cost of USD 14.00 each .
- 2a . Inventory physical receipt updated for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 12.00 each .
- 2b . Inventory financial receipt updated for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 16.00 each .
- 4a . Inventory physical receipt updated for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 14.00 each .
- 4b . Inventory financial receipt updated for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 16.00 each .
- 5 . Inventory close is performed .
- 6a . “ Weighted average inventory close transaction ” financial issue is created to sum the settlements of all the inventory financial receipts .
The following diagram illustrates this series of transactions with the effects of choosing the Weighted average inventory model and the summarized settlement principle without the Include physical value option .
- The green arrow represents the offsetting system-generated receipt transaction to which the originally posted issue transaction is settled
# # Weighted average direct settlement with the Include physical value option
- 1a . Inventory physical receipt updated for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 11.00 each .
- 1b . Inventory financial receipt updated for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 10.00 each .
- 2a . Inventory physical receipt updated for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 15.00 each .
The following diagram illustrates this series of transactions with the effects of choosing the Weighted average inventory model and the direct settlement principle with the Include physical value option .
# # Weighted average summarized settlement with the Include physical value option
- 3a . Inventory physical receipt updated for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 12.00 each .
- 3b . Inventory financial receipt updated for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 16.00 each .
- 5b . Inventory financial receipt updated for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 16.00 each .
- 7a . “ Weighted average inventory close transaction ” financial issue is created to sum the settlements of all the inventory financial receipts .
# # Weighted average with marking
A receipt transaction is marked to an issue transaction . Then , the valuation method selected for the item ’ s item model group will be disregarded and the system will settle these transactions to each other .
You can mark an issue transaction to a receipt before the transaction is posted . You can do this from a sales order line in the Sales order details page . The open receipt transactions are viewed in the Marking page .
You can mark an issue transaction to a receipt after the transaction has been posted . You can match or mark an issue transaction for an open receipt transaction for an inventoried item from a posted inventory adjustment journal .
- 7 Inventory close is performed . Since the financially updated transaction is marked to an existing receipt these transactions are settled to each other and no adjustment is made .
The following diagram illustrates this series of transactions with the effects of choosing the Weighted average inventory model with marking .

title : Set up vendor invoice policies
# Set up vendor invoice policies
This topic describes the purchase requisition workflow and the different statuses that a purchase requisition can have .
Depending on the setup of your organization , you can create purchase requisitions for products that your organization uses . A purchase requisition is an internal document that authorizes the Purchasing department to buy items or services .
After a purchase requisition is approved , it can be used to generate a purchase order . Purchase orders are the external documents that the Purchasing department submits to vendors .
# # # Purchase requisition statuses
When you create a purchase requisition , a status is assigned to it . A status is also assigned to every line that you add to a purchase requisition . When you submit a purchase requisition to a workflow for review , the status of the purchase requisition and the status of each line are updated as the lines move through the workflow process .
# # # Purchase requisition workflow
The following diagram shows the statuses that are assigned to a purchase requisition and a purchase requisition line as they move through the workflow process .
# # # Purchase requisition header and line status relationships
&lt; td &gt; All purchase requisition lines have completed the review process , and there are no more review steps for the purchase requisition .
# # Distributing costs to multiple financial accounts
You can distribute the cost of a product that is included in a purchase requisition to multiple financial accounts . If your organization uses dimensions , such as cost centers and departments , you can distribute the cost of a product to dimensions for financial accounts .
In the procurement policies , you can control the requisition purposes that are available when a requisition is created for your organization .
# # # Requisitions that have a purpose of consumption
# # # Requisitions that have a purpose of replenishment
# # Purchase requisitions and requests for quotation
By consolidating purchase requisition lines from multiple purchase requisitions , you can increase your negotiating power with your vendors to achieve better pricing , lower shipping and handling costs , and reduced overhead costs .
Purchase requisition lines are eligible for demand consolidation only if the following statements are true :
- The purchase requisition has been approved .
After you add requisition lines to a consolidation opportunity and make any changes that you require , you can create a purchase order for the consolidated purchase requisition lines .
To create a purchase order for purchase requisition lines that aren &apos;t eligible for demand consolidation or aren &apos;t selected for a consolidation opportunity , you must process the lines manually .
# # # Consolidating purchase requisition lines
To consolidate approved purchase requisition lines , follow these steps :
1 . Review approved requisition lines that have been held for manual processing , and that are eligible for demand consolidation .
2 . Select lines to add to a consolidation opportunity .
3 . Create a new consolidation opportunity , or add requisition lines to an existing consolidation opportunity .
4 . Make any required changes to the requisition lines , and remove requisition line items that you no longer want to include in the consolidation opportunity .
5 . Create purchase orders for consolidated requisition lines or for purchase requisition lines in a consolidation opportunity .

3 . Save the service object .
The item is now attached to the service object , and any inventory dimensions specified for the item are also copied to the service object .
title : Time and attendance registration
To be able to register time and absence , workers must be set up as time registration workers in the company they are employed in .
After setup , the workers can enter different types of registrations .
- Time and item consumption on production jobs .
- Time used on a machine on the shop floor , if the machine has been defined as a resource .
&#124; A worker can be automatically assigned the time registrations that are made on a particular machine on the shop floor , if the worker chooses to work as an assistant to the machine when he or she starts the production job . &#124;
- Time registrations on projects and project activities .
- Registering project fees and item consumption via the respective project fee journals and project item journals .
- Planned absence .
- Absence when arriving late to work or leaving earlier than planned .
- Work breaks , either manually registered or automatically calculated by the system .
- Indirect activities , which are non-productive activities a worker might engage in during a workday . Examples of these activities include meetings or cleaning their workspace .
If a worker forgets to clock-out at the end of their workday , the missing registration can be added by running a batch job . The system will compare the clock-in time and the clock-out time according to the associated profile of the worker , and automatically insert the missing clock-out registration to match the profile ’ s end time . Both the clock-in and clock-out registrations are vital for the subsequent calculation and approval of time registrations before they can be transferred to payroll .
- Correct erroneous registrations . For example , change switch codes and adjust feedback on production jobs .
- Add missing registrations . For example , create clock-out registrations and create absence transactions .
- Delete incorrect registrations .
- Override pay agreements for individual workers .
- Add manual premiums .
- Enter additional information about absence registrations .
&#124; Workflow &#124; Purpose &#124; Registration type &#124;
&#124; Time and attendance days total &#124; The workflow validates registrations against , for example , the expected number of work hours for the day . &#124; &#124;
- Registration type
- Job reference , such as project , indirect activity , or production order
- Job identification
- Time consumption
- Project fees
- Project items

title : Project management and accounting
The project management and accounting functionality can be used in multiple industries to provide a service , produce a product , or achieve a result .
A project is a group of activities that is designed to provide a service , produce a product , or achieve a result . Projects consume resources and generate financial results in the form of revenues or assets .
The project management and accounting functionality can be used in multiple industries , as shown in the following illustration .
Although the following process flow is aimed toward external projects , or project that are completed for one or more customers , the functionality also applies to internal , cost-only projects .
As shown in the preceding illustration , project management and accounting can be divided into three phases :
# # # Create project contracts
# # # Create work breakdown structures
# # # Create project forecasts and budgets
# # # Assign workers , categories , and resources
Here are some of the ways that you can use the resource scheduling functionality :
- Use information about a worker ’ s calendar and availability to match the worker ’ s schedule to the project calendar .
- Review a worker &apos;s availability to make sure that there are no calendar conflicts with the worker &apos;s assignments .
# # # Manage work breakdown structures
# # # Manage project forecasts and budgets
Based on the combinations of these factors , use one of the following methods :
# # # Procure products and services
The purchase and sale of items are prevalent activities in many project-focused businesses .
# # # # Purchase orders for projects
The purpose of the purchase order determines when the purchase order is consumed and , therefore , when items are charged on a project .
&lt; td &gt; Purchase items from an external vendor for consumption on a project . You can create the purchase order in the following ways :
# # # # Sales orders for projects
In Project management and accounting , you can register the consumption of items in several ways . You can sell items or purchase items from a project , or reserve items for a project .
You can order items from the company ’ s inventory for consumption on a project . Alternatively , or you can purchase items from an external vendor . Items can be consumed on all types of projects except Time projects .
&gt; The packing slip for a project-related sales order can ’ t be canceled if the items have already been marked for packing .
The following table lists the methods for ordering items and describes how the items are consumed .
&#124; Method &#124; Purpose &#124; Consumption of item transactions &#124;
# # # Process project invoices
The project type determines which invoicing procedure should be applied . Only the two external project types ( Time and material and Fixed-price ) can be invoiced . Time and material projects and Fixed-price projects are always attached to a project contract .
# # # Calculate the cost to complete a project
The following table describes the methods for calculating the cost to complete a project .
At its most basic level , a project is used to group transactions that record costs , and then post these costs to the general ledger .
# # # Analyze cash flow
By monitoring cash flows , you can evaluate a single project , use the reports to view multiple projects , and transfer project cash flows to the cash flow forecasts in the general ledger .
# # # # Cash inflow forecasting
The general buffer days can either replace the individual buffer days or be added to the individual buffer days :
- To use the general buffer days as a replacement for the individual buffer days , enter the average number of days between the due date and the actual payment date for customers .
Set up individual buffer days in the project ’ s contract . The days are calculated based on both the sales invoice due date and your organization ’ s experience with a customer &apos;s payment pattern .
# # # # Actual cash inflow
Actual cash inflow resembles forecasting , but you can begin your calculations from the first invoice date . Here is an example :
# # # # Cost forecasting
Based on the days that are defined , the cost payment date can differ from the project date . In this case , the cost payment date is calculated by adding the number of days from the project date to the number of days in the terms of payment .
Based on these settings , here is the cost payment date for each transaction type :
&gt; The due date for the purchase order is based on the vendor transaction when the project purchase order is created . The due date isn &apos;t determined by any default settings .
The cost payment date isn &apos;t calculated on buffer days . After a project is completed , when all costing and invoicing is completed , both the cost and the sales are posted to the profit and loss accounts .
# # # # Viewing the remaining budgeted amounts
# # # # Viewing the total budgeted amounts
The utilization rate is the percentage of time that a worker performs billable or productive work in a specific working period . Billable hours are the worker ’ s hours that can be charged to a specific customer .
When you calculate the utilization rate for a worker , you can calculate either the billable rate or the efficiency rate :
# # # Review project statements
- Project types
- Project date / ledger date

title : Product information overview
A product is primarily defined by a product number , name , and description . However , other data is also required in order to describe a product or service :
- Product type : Item or service
- Product subtype : Distinct products or product masters
- Definition of the product variant model :
- Product dimensions and dimension groups
- Product nomenclature
- Product configuration models
- Definition of the product and category attributes
- Product images
- Units of measure and related conversions
- Translations for all names and descriptions
# # Distribution , export , and import of product data
# # Product masters and product variants
You can choose among three configuration technologies :
- The constraint-based configuration uses a product configuration model to describe all possible attributes and components that are required in order to describe all possible variants of a product in a single model . The constraints of combinations of attributes can be described through regular expressions or table-based constraints . Configuration models and configurators become more important in product information management and are used across all industries .

The following transaction types are available for use in single-company and cross-company settlements :
- Foreign currency revaluations ( includes realized and unrealized foreign currency revaluations )
- Penny difference
- Overpayment / underpayment
# # Currency exchange gains or losses
- Payment accounting currency : EUR
- Invoice accounting currency : USD
- Payment transaction currency : DKK
- Invoice transaction currency : CAD
The resulting payment amount is transferred to the payment journal line when you close the * * Settle open transactions * * page .
# # # Posting for gain or loss because of different accounting currencies
If the cash discount administration selection is Unspecific , unspecific payment settlement rules apply only in the following situations :
- There is an overpayment .
- The cash discount is posted in the same legal entity as the overpayment .
In all other situations , overpayments or underpayments are posted to the automatic account for Customer cash discount , Vendor cash discount , or Penny difference in accounting currency .
Sales tax transactions remain in the legal entity where they were originally posted .
If sales tax was posted for a prepayment , the cross-company settlement reverses the sales tax on the prepayment in the legal entity of the prepayment . The taxes in the legal entity of the invoice remain in the legal entity of the invoice .
For customer payments , the due-to and due-from transactions in the legal entity of the payment use the financial dimensions that are specified for the accounts receivable summary account from the payment that is being settled . In the legal entity of the invoice , due-to and due-from transactions use the financial dimensions that are specified for the accounts receivable summary account from the invoice that is being settled .
For vendor payments , the due-to and due-from transactions in the legal entity of the payment use the financial dimensions that are specified for the accounts payable summary account from the payment that is being settled . In the legal entity of the invoice , due-to and due-from transactions use the financial dimensions that are specified for the accounts payable summary account from the invoice that is being settled .

# Build a product configuration model
The need to configure products to meet special requirements is becoming the rule rather than the exception , in both business-to-business and business-to-consumer relationships .
A successful move from a manufacture-to-stock setup to a configure-to-order setup requires careful analysis of the product structures , identification of product families , and componentization . To reduce the number of parts and minimize the number of goods that are in process , it &apos;s very important that you understand the product interfaces , and that you design for reusability .
The industrialization period has led to great achievements in producing high-quality and feature-rich products at affordable prices . The economies of scale have made it possible for most people in the industrialized world to buy cars , TVs , household appliances , and other goods that most of us consider a necessary part of our everyday life .
# # Building a product configuration model
Table constraints can be user-defined or system-defined .
A user-defined table constraint is built by the user . The user selects a combination of attribute types to represent the columns of the table and then enters values from the domains of the selected attribute types to form the rows in the table constraint .
A table constraint is included in a product configuration model by referencing the table constraint definition and mapping the relevant attributes in the model to the columns in the table constraint .
Calculations represent a mechanism for performing arithmetic operations in a configuration model . For example , a calculation can determine the length of a specific piece of raw material or the processing time for a polishing operation . Calculations are imperative and set the value for a target attribute after all the attribute values that are included in the calculation expression become available .
A user requirement has all the constituents of a subcomponent . The only difference is that a user requirement isn &apos;t bound to a product master . The practical effect of this difference is that any BOM lines or route operation that are defined in the context of a user requirement are collapsed into the parent component BOM structure or route . This behavior resembles the behavior of a phantom BOM .
BOM lines are included to identify the manufacturing BOM for each component . A BOM line must reference an item , and all item properties can be set to a fixed value or mapped to an attribute .
# # Validating and testing a product configuration model
Validation of a product configuration model can occur on several levels in the model and can therefore cover various scopes . The lowest level is for a single expression constraint . In this case , validation is typically performed by the product designer to verify that the syntax of an expression is correct .
Similarly , a condition for a BOM line or a route operation can be validated in isolation .
Validation can also be done for a user-defined table constraint definition . In this case , the user can verify that the values that are entered for each field are inside the domain of the corresponding attribute types .
Finally , validation can be done for a complete product configuration model to verify that the complete syntax is correct , and that all naming and modeling conventions have been respected .
# # # The configuration page
# # Finalizing a model for configuration
The configuration UI can be modified by introducing attribute groups in one or more subcomponents . Such a grouping can highlight the relationships between specific attributes and help the configuration user identify the area of the product that is currently in focus .
One or more configuration templates can be created to speed up the configuration process . Alternatively , templates can be created to promote specific attribute combinations , such as when a sales campaign focuses on a specific set of product features .
The last and most important step in the finalization process is to create a version for the product configuration model . The version represents the relationship between the product master , which can be selected for configuration on an order or quotation line , and the product configuration model . A version must be approved and activated before it can be used in a configuration session .
# # Extending a product configuration model through the API
The following flow diagram outlines the process .
Product configuration API flow diagram
Product configuration can be performed from the following places :
- Sales order line
- Sales quotation line
- Production order line
- Item requirement line ( project )
The purpose of the configuration is to create a distinct variant of the product that meets the customer ’ s requirement . A unique configuration ID is created for each new configuration . This ID enables tracking through inventory .

title : Vendor invoices overview
This article provides general information about vendor invoices . Vendor invoices are requests for payment for products and services that were received . Vendor invoices can represent a bill for ongoing services , or they can be based on purchase orders for specific items and services .
A vendor invoice from a purchase order is an invoice that is produced when products or services are received according to a purchase order that was placed with a vendor . The vendor invoice contains a header , and one or more lines for items or services . A vendor invoice completes the cycle from purchase order to product receipt to vendor invoice .
- The vendor invoice journal lets you quickly enter invoices that don &apos;t reference a purchase order , in a single step .
- Together with the vendor invoice pool , the vendor invoice register lets you quickly enter invoices to accrue the expense . You can open the associated purchase orders later to post the invoice against the expense account .
# # Understanding invoice line quantities
When you open a vendor invoice from a related purchase order , invoice lines are created from the purchase order . By default , the quantities are taken from the product receipt quantity . However , you can use any of the following default behaviors :
# # Adding a line that wasn &apos;t on the purchase order

Here are some of the guidelines for using TCA for co-products :
- You don ’ t need to manually enter cost allocation percentages for co-products . Instead , the system automatically creates the cost allocation percentage as the average of active cost prices of co-products .
- You don ’ t need to enter standard cost for non-standard cost items that are co-products . There are two types of costing versions in the system : standard cost and planned cost
- You added co-products .
- You used a different method of cost allocation for the co-products .
- The percentage of cost allocation is more than 0 ( zero ) .

Leave and absence management provides the following features :
Several job-related filters can be used to assign a group of employees to a leave plan . HR managers can view an employee to see what leave and absence plans the employee is enrolled in . Alternatively , HR managers can view all plans and the related employee enrollments .
Leave and absence plans can be suspended to make them inactive and prevent additional accruals . Accruals are suspended for employees if their employment ends .
An employee can be enrolled in a higher plan tier by using a worker-specific date to override the employee &apos;s default plan offering . Employees can receive a manual adjustment to their leave and absence balance at the time of plan enrollment , or HR can make a manual adjustment at any time .
A workflow can be customized and applied to time-off requests to meet the organization ’ s requirements .
Employees , their manager , and HR can view leave and absence balances . HR can use interactive reports to track plan enrollments and time-off balances by type .
title : One voucher
# # What is One voucher ?
- Enter a multiline voucher where there is no offset account .
# # The future of One voucher
# # # Post vendor or customer payments in summary form to a bank account
# # # Mechanism to group transactions from a business event
If an organization must view the accounting entries from a business event together , it must use One voucher .
# # # Customer prepayment payment journal that has taxes on multiple &quot; lines &quot;
In this scenario , the customers in the single voucher are the same customer , because the transaction simulates the lines of a customer order . The prepayment must be entered in a single voucher , because the tax calculation must be made on the &quot; lines &quot; of the single payment that the customer made .
If the Reimbursement periodic task is run from the Accounts receivable module , it creates a transaction to move the balance from a customer to a vendor . For this scenario , One voucher must be used to reimburse the customer .
The following fixed asset transactions also create multiple transactions in a single voucher :
- An additional acquisition is made on an asset , and &quot; catch-up &quot; depreciation is calculated .
- A parameter to calculate depreciation on disposal is turned on , and then the asset is disposed of .
- An asset &apos;s service date is before the acquisition date . Therefore , a depreciation adjustment is posted .
# # # Bills of exchange and promissory notes
Bills of exchange and promissory notes require that One voucher be used , because the transactions move the customer or vendor balance from one Accounts receivable / Accounts payable ledger account to another , based on the state of the payment .
# # Scenarios that don &apos;t require One voucher
The following scenarios can be accomplished through other means and should not use the One voucher functionality .
# # # Post customer payments in summary form to the bank account
An organization deposits customer payments , or the bank deposits customer payments on the organization &apos;s behalf , and the deposit is shown as a lump sum on the bank account .
Summarization of customer payments is supported through the deposit functionality when &quot; bridging &quot; isn &apos;t used on the method of payment .
Netting can be accomplished by entering the increase and decrease in separate vouchers , and then posting the offset to a clearing ledger account .
# # # Post in summary to the general ledger
- After support for One voucher is removed , the Source document and Accounting frameworks can be implemented in the journals . These frameworks will then maintain the transaction details and support summarization into the general ledger .
# # # Settle multiple unposted payments to the same invoice
This scenario is typically found in retail organizations where customers can use multiple methods of payment to pay for purchases . In this scenario , the organization must be able to record multiple unposted payments and settle them against the customer invoice .
# # # Import bank statement transactions
Transactions can be grouped by using other fields on the journal , such as the journal batch number itself or the document number .
# # # Enter beginning balances
# # # Correct the accounting entry of a posted customer or vendor document
# # # &quot; The system allows it &quot;
Organizations often use the One voucher functionality merely because the system lets them use it , without understanding the implications .

What product-related data can be translated ?
You can create translations for the following product-related information :
- Names and descriptions of products .
- Descriptions , friendly names , and help text of product attribute values .
- Names and descriptions of product dimension values .
# # Where can I view the translated information ?
# # How do I create translations for product-related information ?
To create translations for a product , follow these steps :
To create translations for product attributes , follow these steps :
To create translations for product dimension values , follow these steps :
# # Can the names of product variants be translated ?
Product variants are based on the dimensions of a released product . Product variant names are based on a combination of dimension values . When the dimension values that are associated with a product variant are translated , the name of the product variant appears in the translated version .
Your product is a T-shirt that comes in different sizes and colors and the variant names are based on the following details :
- Dimensions : Size and color
- Size dimension values : Small , Medium , Large
&lt; td &gt; To set the preferred language of a customer , follow these steps :
# # What happens if a customer has a preferred language for which no translations are available ?
If translations are not available in the customer ’ s preferred language , the names and descriptions are displayed in the global language of your own company .
# # Can I manage translations for a series of dimension values at the same time ?
Dimension values are product specific and you can manage the translations for the dimension values for each product . However , if you create a dimension value group and create translations for the values in the value group , it is easier to manage the translations .
A dimension value that is associated with a product through a dimension variant group must be maintained from the product variant group .

Dimension-based product configuration represents a simple solution for creating many product variants from a single product master and its bill of materials .
Dimension-based product configuration is one of the three built-in product configuration technologies . The two other technologies are predefined variants and constraint-based configuration . All three technologies use a product master as the starting point and allow the user to create many product variants for one product master .
Dimension-based product configuration is based on the following key concepts :
- Product masters
- Configuration product dimension
- Configuration groups
- Configuration route
- Configuration rules
A product master is the starting point for any product configuration process . For the dimension-based product configuration , you need a product master with this particular configuration technology and a product dimension group that includes the configuration product dimension .
The configuration product dimension is used to identify the product variants for a product master with the dimension-based configuration technology . The configuration dimension value is entered by the user and should help to identify the individual product variants .
Configuration groups are defined in a central repository and can be used for all dimension-based product configuration models . Configuration groups are associated to the individual BOM lines and hold together a group of lines that are mutually exclusive . This means that only one line in a group can be selected for a single product variant .
The configuration route determines the sequence of the configuration groups , as they will be displayed to the user during the product configuration process .
The configuration rules represent a mechanism for ensuring that a product included in one configuration group in a BOM enforces either an inclusion or an exclusion of a product in a different configuration group in the same BOM .
The following eight task guides are listed in the order in which you should complete them .
title : Design questionnaires
A carefully designed questionnaire can help increase the quality of the data that you collect . Through careful design , you can better select the appropriate options at the appropriate time for a questionnaire . The following points can help you plan an effective questionnaire :
- Clearly define the purpose of the questionnaire to help guarantee that the questions support the purpose .
- Determine the individual person or the group of people who should complete the questionnaire .
- Be sure that the questionnaire flows logically , so that respondents remain engaged .
- Arrange questions and answers in the order that they should be presented to respondents in .
- Decide how the results should be evaluated , if applicable .
The design phase includes four categories of tasks that you must complete in this order :
1 . Set up prerequisites , as required .
2 . Set up answer groups and answers , if applicable .
3 . Set up questions and their association with the answer groups .
4 . Set up the questionnaire itself , and attach questions to it .
Some prerequisites must be in place before you can create questionnaires , answers , and questions . However , not all prerequisites are required for full functionality .
&#124; Question types &#124; Categorize questions . &#124;
&#124; Questionnaire parameters &#124; Modify basic controls and default settings for questionnaires . &#124;
- Human resource development
- Customer surveys
Question types are required and must be assigned when you create a question .
- Human resource
- Managing business
- Course evaluation
Questionnaire parameters are optional . You might not use them , depending on your company ’ s requirements .
The number sequence codes are used to organize questions and answers . Based on these number sequence codes , values are automatically assigned to items .
You should define all parameters before you begin to create your data . You can modify the questionnaire parameter settings at any time .
# # # Answer groups and answers
Respondents can answer a question in two ways , depending on the subject of the question :
- Closed-ended questions require that the respondent select an answer in a list of possible correct answers .
An answer group can be used for more than one question on the same questionnaire , and can also be used on more than one questionnaire .
A questionnaire must contain questions . Questions can be either open-ended or closed-ended .
- The responses to open-ended questions aren &apos;t controlled , and respondents can type their answers .
Questions can be arranged in a conditional question hierarchy , so that secondary questions depend on the answer that the respondent selects for the previous question . You can write the questions first and then arrange them into a hierarchy later .
- The total time or time limit to answer mandatory questions .
- Whether all questions are mandatory .
- Whether to calculate points on a questionnaire .
- How to categorize results .
- Whether the questionnaire will be available to a restricted set of respondents .
- Whether a form template should be displayed as a background behind each page of the questionnaire .
- Whether additional notes are required in order to clarify the intent of the questionnaire for the respondents .
- Whether to display questions in a fixed order or randomly select them from a pool .
- Whether questions will be asked only if specific responses are given for previous answers .
2 . Follow one of these steps to attach questions to the questionnaire :
- If you &apos;re using result groups , you can attach questions to a questionnaire by using result groups . First set up the result groups for the questionnaire , and then add questions to the result groups .
- If you aren &apos;t using result groups , you can attach questions directly to the questionnaire .
3 . Set up a conditional question hierarchy , if it &apos;s required .
# # # Modify a questionnaire
You can complete the following tasks on the * * Questionnaires * * page :
- Modify information in the questionnaire , such as the result groups and questions .
- Delete and add questions .
- Make changes in the result groups and sequence number .
- Questions that are attached to a questionnaire
Result groups are optional when you attach questions to a questionnaire .
A result group is used to calculate points and categorize the results of a questionnaire . If you use result groups , you can perform the following tasks :
- Evaluate questionnaire results , based on point statistics .
- Evaluate a respondent ’ s score for each result group that you set up .
- Generate statistics for each result group to help you analyze results .
- Print a report that shows results for each result group , and also optional points / texts that are based on points that are earned in each result group .
- Define points for answers in the answer groups that are assigned to each question .
- Set up a questionnaire .
You can set up multiple result groups to evaluate the points that a respondent earns in each category . After a questionnaire is completed , you can view the points that have been achieved for each result group .
Because a result group is related to the points that are associated with specific sets of questions on a questionnaire , you can use only a specific result group for a questionnaire .
You &apos;re using a questionnaire for a leadership test that has 15 questions in three categories . You create three result groups and add five questions to each result group . Points are then totaled in the three groups . The three result groups are as follows :
- Creative abilities
- Leadership abilities
- Technical abilities
The following table shows the point-based messages that you define for the “ leadership abilities ” result group .
&#124; Point interval &#124; Text &#124;
You can set up point intervals and texts for each result group on a questionnaire . Texts that correspond to each respondent ’ s score are displayed for each result group .
Conditional question hierarchies are optional when you set up a questionnaire .

What is the goal of SEPA direct debits ?
A SEPA direct debit allows a creditor to collect funds from a customer ’ s bank account , provided that a signed mandate has been granted by the customer to the creditor . The customer signs a mandate that authorizes the creditor to collect a payment and instructs the customer ’ s bank to pay the collection .
# # What is the Core Direct Debit scheme ?
The SEPA Core Direct Debit Scheme is the basic scheme . It has the following attributes :
- The transfer of funds is in euros ( even though the bank accounts may hold funds in other currencies ) .
- The customer and creditor must each hold an account with a credit institution that is located within the SEPA .
- The customer must grant a signed mandate to the creditor .
- Mandates expire 36 months after the last initiated collection .
- The creditor must store mandates for as long as the mandate is valid and for at least 14 months after the last collection .
The SEPA B2B Direct Debit Scheme applies to business-to-business transactions and builds on the SEPA Core Direct Debit Scheme . The main differences are :
- The customer is not entitled to obtain a refund of an authorized transaction .
- Customer banks must make sure that that the collection is authorized , by verifying the collection against mandate information . Customer banks and customers are required to agree on the verification that will be performed for each direct debit .
- The scheme offers a shorter timeline for presenting direct debits and reduces the return period .
# # Can I use the COR1 scheme for direct debit mandates ?
# # Where do I enter creditor identifiers ( Direct debit IDs ) ?
# # What are mandates ?
The customer signs a mandate that authorizes the creditor to collect a payment and instructs the customer ’ s bank to pay the collection . The customer can issue the mandate in paper form or electronically . By default , the mandate expires 36 months after the direct debit is last initiated .
# # In what file formats can I generate SEPA direct debit payment files ?
# # How do refunds and returns work with SEPA direct debits ?

title : Set up vendor accounts
This topic describes the types of information that you must specify when you create a new vendor account .
- Configure the vendor for catalog import . Vendors can provide a file that contains the catalog of their items and services . This file can be uploaded so that your workers can order from the vendor .
- Assign the vendor to procurement categories .
- Allow an existing vendor to do business with another legal entity in your organization .
- Put a vendor on hold for specific types of transactions .
- Set up banking information for the vendor , so that you can send payments electronically .
- Set up default financial dimensions that are used to automatically post transactions with the vendor to financial accounts .
You can also create a user template for your own use . You can &apos;t delete a vendor that is associated with other records , such as contacts or products .
You can store contacts for a vendor . These contacts can then be used on documents such as purchase orders or requests for quotation ( RFQs ) .
You can &apos;t delete a contact person record if the contact is referenced on a document . Instead , you can inactivate the contact .
# # Vendors in different legal entities
If multiple legal entities in your organization do business with the same vendor , and each legal entity maintains a separate vendor account for that vendor , you can merge the party IDs for the vendor accounts . In this way , information such as the address and the number of employees can be shared , so that you must update it in only one place .
To merge party IDs , follow these steps .
# # Putting a vendor on hold
You can put a vendor on hold for various transaction types . The following options are available :
When you put a vendor on hold , you can also specify a reason and a date when the on-hold status will end . If you don &apos;t enter an end date , the vendor &apos;s on-hold status lasts indefinitely .
The following criteria are used to include vendors that have been inactive in a period , include or exclude vendors that are employees , and exclude vendors that are under a grace time before the next hold .
# # Creating and posting statements
You can create a statement manually or by using batch processes that you set up to run periodically throughout the day . In both cases , the following steps are used to create and post statements .
# # # Create the statement
This step identifies the store that the statement is manually created for . If you configure a batch process , you can automatically create statements for all stores , based on a schedule that you define .
# # # Calculate the statement
Statement calculation uses tender declarations from the registers as the counted amount . Alternatively , you can enter the counted amount manually . The statement shows the difference between the sales amount for the transactions and the actual counted amount in all payment methods . The statement is posted only if this difference is less than the maximum posting difference that is defined for the store .
&gt; The statement calculation process uses the global number sequence .
When you calculate a statement , the calculation includes the following tasks :
- For the selected date range , mark transactions that weren &apos;t included in a previous statement calculation .
If your store &apos;s operating hours extend past midnight , you can configure statement posting so that it &apos;s based on the end of the business day instead of the end of the calendar day .
&gt; Before you can create statements , you should close the shifts in the statement period .
# # # Post the statement
When you post a statement , sales orders and invoices are created for the retail sales in the statement .
- Cash and carry sales are aggregated onto one sales order , and are invoiced for the default customer who is assigned to the store .
Payment journals are automatically created for the payments in the statement , and the inventory is updated for the POS store .

title : Plan your organizational hierarchy
# # Decide whether to model internal organizations as legal entities or operating units
Some functionality in Finance and Operations works differently depending on whether the organization is a legal entity or an operating unit . Carefully consider the functionality described below as you make your decision .
# # # # If the organization is modeled as an operating unit
Master data is shared among operating units .
Module parameters are shared among operating units .
An operating unit can ’ t have its own ledger information . If your internal organizations do not require unique ledgers , you can model them as operating units . Ledger information will be set up for the parent legal entity in the hierarchy . Income statements can be created for operating units within a legal entity or for the parent legal entity .
Each legal entity has its own fiscal calendar . If your internal organizations use different fiscal years and fiscal calendars , you must model the organizations as legal entities .
Operating units must share a fiscal calendar . If your internal organizations can use the same fiscal years and fiscal calendars , you can model the organizations as operating units .
You must consolidate the financial results for regional offices into a single , consolidated company in order to prepare financial statements .
Consolidation is not required , because data is already shared among operating units .
Centralized payments must be set up so that invoices for all child legal entities can be paid to or from a single parent legal entity .
Centralized payments are not required because all invoices are recorded in a single legal entity .
# # # # # Example 1 : Headquarters provides services to regional offices and must charge the costs of those services to the regional offices
If you model the regional office as a legal entity , you have the following options :
- Headquarters creates a journal entry to cross-charge the regional office for the expense . The transactions cannot be aged .
- Headquarters sends a purchase order for the services to the regional office . A sales order is automatically created in the legal entity for the regional office , with intercompany sub-ledger transactions .
- The invoice and payment follow the regulatory requirements of headquarters . Headquarters can create a journal entry to cross-charge the regional office for the expense . The transactions cannot be aged .
- The invoice and payment follow the regulatory requirements of headquarters . Headquarters can create an intercompany sub-ledger transaction .
If you model the regional office as an operating unit , headquarters enters an expense transaction and codes it to the regional office .
If you model the regional office as an operating unit , the invoice and payment follow the regulatory requirements of headquarters . The invoice can be coded to the regional office . On the income statement , use a balancing financial dimension to report costs for the regional office .
# # # Local tax requirements
If your organizations must use different functional currencies , you must model the organizations as legal entities . Functional currencies are set up per legal entity . However , you can enter transactions in multiple currencies .
If your organizations can use a single functional currency , you can model the organizations as operating units . Operating units must share a functional currency . However , you can enter transactions and create reports in multiple currencies .
Number sequences for some references can be set up per legal entity . Some number sequences can be shared .
Number sequences for some references can be set up per operating unit . Some number sequences can be shared .
All operating units share the same set of products . If your internal organizations can share the same set of products , you can model the organizations as operating units .
# # # Inquiry and reporting
You must manually change companies to enter transactions and perform inquiries in multiple legal entities . Because of data security boundaries , consolidated inquiry and reporting can be resource intensive and time-consuming .
You do not need to change companies to access data from multiple operating units . Consolidated inquiry and reporting and individual regional inquiry is easier and faster .
# # Best practices for modeling organizations and hierarchies
Consider the following best practices when you implement an organization hierarchy :
- Model multiple hierarchies for operating units if you have complex requirements for reporting profit and loss .
- In a single legal entity , do not model multiple hierarchies for the same hierarchy purpose .
- Do not model a separate hierarchy of operating units if the structure for legal entities is also your operating structure . A mixed hierarchy of legal entities and operating units may serve both purposes .
- Before you model major restructuring scenarios , use the hierarchy &apos;s effective dates to perform an impact analysis and a validation test .
- Use draft mode to change a hierarchy before you publish a new version in a production environment .
- Limit the number of people who have permissions to add or remove organizations from a hierarchy in a production environment . A smaller number reduces the chance that costly mistakes can occur and corrections must be made .

title : Position forecasting
Expenses that are related to workers often make up a large proportion of an organization &apos;s costs . Position forecasting lets you plan those expenses and include them in the planning of budgets .
# # Position forecasting in budget planning
Position forecasting uses three main components to provide accurate budget amounts for position expenses . These amounts can then be brought into a budget plan for budget calculations .
# # # Position forecasting processes
You can create additional forecast position versions as budget plans are revised . These new versions provide a basis for the revisions .
# # # Budget cost elements
Budget cost elements are used to define cost details for a forecast position . These details include the type of cost , how the cost is calculated , and whether the cost is allocated to multiple dates when the forecast position is included in a budget plan .
If the cost element is based on a percentage , you must specify the budget cost elements that are used as the basis for the calculation .
Compensation groups can be used to group forecast position that have similar compensation attributes . They can also be used to define a forecast position ’ s earnings and annual increases , and to assign a set of common budget cost elements .
# # # Creating forecast positions for existing positions
# # # Creating new forecast positions
You can create new forecast positions in two ways : by copying an existing forecast position and by creating a completely new forecast position .
# # Working with forecast positions
# # # Multiple versions of a forecast position
# # # Modifying forecast positions
# # # # Budget cost elements
# # # # Generating increases
# # # # Changes from other pages
Updates to forecast positions can also come from other areas , such as the budget cost element and the compensation group setup pages . You can also modify forecast positions by using the mass update process .
The recalculation process is automatically used on any forecast position that has changed .
# # Bringing forecast positions into budget plans
The purpose of creating and modifying forecast positions is to add them to budget plans , so that the budget plans include the most accurate budget amounts . There are two methods for adding forecast positions to budget plans . You can use either a generation process or a selection process on the budget plan .
# # # Generating a budget plan from forecast positions
As for other generation processes , three options are available :
# # # Selecting forecast positions
# # # # Date options
# # # # Changing budget plan lines that have forecast positions
