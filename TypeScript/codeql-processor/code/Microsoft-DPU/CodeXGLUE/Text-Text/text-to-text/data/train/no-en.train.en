title : Balances Between Cost Type , Cost Center , and Cost Object
# Balances Between Cost Type , Cost Center , and Cost Object
When you set up cost accounting , you must make sure that all entries are assigned to a cost type as well as a cost center or a cost object . The means that each cost entry must have a cost type assigned and a cost center code or a cost object assigned . This rule ensures that each cost entry appears in either the cost centers or the cost objects , but never in both places .
By doing this , you create the following accounting equation :
Cost Type Balance = Cost Center Balance + Cost Object Balance
When you print the chart of cost type , the chart of cost centers , and the chart of cost objects reports , you can analyze this relationship .

As a rule , use the suggested data in this walkthrough because this data has the necessary records .
Eduardo , the Production Planner of a small manufacturing company , is about to plan production and purchase orders to fulfill new sales demand .
In a more complex manufacturing environment , the planning worksheet is used to plan supply based on item parameters such as rescheduling period , safety lead time , reorder point , and batch calculations of consolidated demand from all product levels .
# # Setting Up the Sample Data
The standard CRONUS demonstration company currently has lots of unplanned demand . During the different planning tasks in this walkthrough , you will have to deviate from the realistic business flow by ignoring demand with close due dates and instead use demand with later due dates .
# # Using the Order Planning Window
- Manufacturing , Planning
- Sales &amp; Marketing , Order Processing
- Purchase , Planning
# # # To use the Order Planning window
The planning system analyzes any new demand that has been introduced , such as new sales , changed sales , or production orders .
When the calculation is completed , the window displays all unfulfilled demand as collapsed order header lines sorted by earliest demand date .
With the * * Demand Type * * field , you can choose which order types that you want to display .
Orders that do not have availability problems are not shown . If no orders exist when a plan is calculated , a message will display and no planning lines will appear .
# # Planning a Purchase Order to Fulfill Component Demand
In this procedure , you create a purchase order for needed manufacturing components .
# # # To plan a purchase order to fulfill component need in production
The default value is from the item card , or SKU card , but you can change it to one of the following options :
If the field is not filled in , an error message will display when you try to create the supply orders .
You are now ready to create a purchase order .
The purchase orders are now created and saved as the last orders in the list of purchase orders .
# # Planning a Transfer Order to Fulfill Sales Demand
In this procedure , you will plan for demand from a sales order . Demand lines represent sales lines and not component lines , as in production demand .
# # # To plan a transfer order to fulfill sales demand
2 . Expand the line and move the pointer to the demand line .
The item ’ s defined replenishment system and default vendor will display .
The transfer order is now created and saved in the list as the last order in the list of open transfer orders .
# # Planning a Multilevel Production Order to Fulfill Sales Demand
In this procedure , you will plan to fulfill sales demand for a produced item with multiple product levels , each creating dependent production demand .
# # # To plan multilevel production to fulfill sales demand
As a production planner you now must plan a specific production order .
# # # To plan a specific production order
Now you must supply ten of each component .
Note that four of the demand lines have replenishment system Prod . Order . These four subassemblies represent the second product level of the bicycle .
The default replenishment settings are already filled in and you can proceed to make orders .
The suggested supply plan indicates that a total of four purchase orders will be created for the components . You decide to make the proposed orders .

title : Learn About General Ledger and COA
# # General Ledger Setup and General Posting Setup
The setup of the general ledger is at the core of financial processes because it defines how you post data .
* Invoice rounding details
# # The Chart of Accounts
The chart of accounts shows all general ledger accounts . From the chart of accounts , you can do things like :
* View reports that show general ledger entries and balances .
* Close your income statement .
* Open the G / L account card to add or change settings .
* See a list of posting groups that post to that account .
* View separate debit and credit balances for a single account
You can add , change , or delete general ledger accounts . However , to prevent discrepancies , you can &apos;t delete a general ledger account if it &apos;s data is used in the chart of accounts .
You can personalize the structure of your financial statements by mapping general ledger accounts to account categories .
You can specify whether the accounts in each subcategory must be included in specific types of reports . The account categories help define the layout of your financial statements .
The next time you generate account schedules your balance statement will show a total balance for cash and two lines with balances for petty cash and the checking account .

title : How to Work with Service Contracts and Service Contract Quotes
# How to : Work with Service Contracts and Service Contract Quotes
You can create a service contract either manually or from a service contract quote . You can use a service contract quote as a forerunner of a service contract , in which your company makes an offer to the customer and obtains customer approval before you can convert it to a service contract . The procedures for creating either a service contract or service contract quote are similar .
# # To create a service contract or service contract quote
2 . Create a new service contract or service contract quote .
7 . Add contract lines to the service contract or service contract quote .
8 . Fill in the rest of the fields as necessary .
When a customer has accepted a service contract quote , you convert it to a service contract . At the same time , you can create a service invoice for the starting period of the contract if the starting date of the contract is before the beginning of the next invoice period .
For detailed contracts , the invoiced amount is calculated as follows :
* Invoiced amount = sum of the invoiced amount for each contract line .
* If the contract line expires before the starting period ends , the expiration date becomes the ending date of the starting period for the line .
For contracts that are not detailed , the invoiced amount is calculated as follows :
* If the contract expires before the starting period ends , the expiration date becomes the ending date of the starting period .
2 . Open the service contract quote you want to convert to a service contract .
The service invoice is posted to the service account of the contract , even if the contract is prepaid .
# # To create contract service credit memos
You can use a contract service credit memo when a customer cancels a prepaid service contract or removes a service item from a prepaid contract . You can also use it to correct an erroneous service invoice .
2 . Create a new service credit memo .
# # Updating and evaluating contracts
# # To add a contract line to a service contract or contract quote
When a customer purchases a new item and wants to include it in the existing service contract or contract quote , you can register the item as a service item and then add it as a new contract line to the contract or contract quote .
2 . Open the relevant service contract or service contract quote that you want to add a new contract line for .
# # To remove contract lines
You may need to remove contract lines from the service contract as you remove corresponding service items from the service contract . Usually you remove a contract line that is expired or corresponds to the service item that has broken down .
2 . Open the service contract from which you want to remove contract lines .
# # Service Line Cost and Value
&#124; Line Value Options &#124; Description &#124;
# # To add a contract discount to service contract quotes
2 . Choose the quote to add discounts for .
# # To change the owner of a service contract
You may need to change the owner of a service contract . If a service item in a service contract is registered in noncanceled multiple contracts owned by the same customer , then the owner of all service contracts that include this service item and of all other service items included in these contracts is updated automatically .
&gt; In this case , only noncanceled contracts are considered . The status of the contract quotes is not taken into account .
&gt; Service items and contracts can be related . Changing the owner of a service contract can affect these relationships .
# # To update a service contract price
You can update the prices on service contracts by specifying a price update percentage .
2 . Choose the service contract .
# # To post prepaid contract entries
If you work with prepaid service contracts , you must regularly post prepaid contract entries , thereby transferring the prepaid payments from the prepaid contract accounts to the regular contract accounts .
# # Changing the Service Contract Status
# # To cancel a service contract
You may need to cancel a service contract when the contract has expired or has been canceled by you or the customer .
&gt; You cannot reopen a contract after it is canceled .

title : Design Details - Cost Adjustment
# Design Details : Cost Adjustment
The main purpose of cost adjustment is to forward cost changes from cost sources to cost recipients , according to an item ’ s costing method , to provide correct inventory valuation .
The following are secondary purposes , or functions , of cost adjustment :
* Invoice finished production orders :
* Update the unit cost on the item card .
* Average Cost Adjustment Entry Point
# # # Item Application Entry
* Cost adjustment is detected by marking the source item ledger entries as * Applied Entry to Adjust * whenever an item ledger entry or value entry is posted .
# # # Average Cost Adjustment Entry Point
This detection function is used for items that use the Average costing method . The function works as follows :
* Cost is forwarded by applying the costs to value entries with a later valuation date .
This detection function is used in conversion scenarios , production and assembly . The function works as follows :
* Cost adjustment is detected by marking the order whenever a material / resource is posted as consumed / used .
* Cost is forwarding by applying the costs from material / resource to the output entries associated with the same order .
The Order Level function is used to detect adjustments in assembly posting . The following graphic shows the adjustment entry structure :
# # Manual versus Automatic Cost Adjustment
Cost adjustment can be performed in two ways :
# # Adjust Cost - Item Entries Batch Job
&gt; We recommend that you always run the batch job for all items and only use the filtering option to reduce the runtime of the batch job , or to fix the cost of a certain item .
* * Relation Entries in the G / L – Item Ledger Relation Table * *
&#124; Never &#124; Costs are not adjusted when you post . &#124;
&#124; Day &#124; Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one day from the work date . &#124;
&#124; Week &#124; Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one week from the work date . &#124;
&#124; Month &#124; Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one month from the work date . &#124;
&#124; Quarter &#124; Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one quarter from the work date . &#124;
&#124; Year &#124; Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one year from the work date . &#124;
&#124; Always &#124; Costs are always adjusted when you post , regardless of the posting date . &#124;
The following example shows an automatic cost adjustment scenario :
* On January 10 , you post a purchased item as received and invoiced .
* On January 15 , you post a sales order for the item as shipped and invoiced .
If you have set up the automatic cost adjustment to apply to postings that occur within a month or a quarter from the current work date , then the automatic cost adjustment runs and forwards the cost of the purchase to the sale .

title : How to Set Up Shop Calendars
# How to : Set Up Shop Calendars
A work center or machine calendar specifies the working days and hours , shifts , holidays , and absences that determine the center ’ s gross available capacity , measured in time , according to its defined efficiency and capacity values .
As a foundation for calculating a specific work or machine center calendar , you must first set up one or more general shop calendars . A shop calendar defines a standard work week according to start and end times of each working day and the work shift relation . In addition , the shop calendar defines the fixed holidays during a year .
The following describes how to set up work center calendars . The steps are similar when setting up machine center calendars .
# # To create work shifts
4 . Optionally , fill in lines for a second or third work shift .
Even if your work centers do not work in different work shifts , enter at least one work shift code .
# # To set up a shop calendar
Any week days that you do not define in the shop calendar , such as Saturday and Sunday , are considered non-working days and will have zero available capacity in a work center calendar .
The defined holidays will have zero available capacity in a work center calendar .
The shop calendar can now be assigned to a work center to calculate the work shop calendar that will govern all operation scheduling at that work center .
# # To calculate a work center calendar
2 . Open the work center that you want to update .
To reflect the new shop calendar as a line on the selected work center , it must first be calculated .
Calendar entries are now created or updated displaying the available capacity for each period according to the following three sets of master data :
- The working days and shift defined in the assigned shop calendar .
The calculated work center calendar will now define when and how much capacity is available at this work center . This controls the detailed scheduling of operations performed at the work center .
# # To record work center absence
The capacity of the selected day has now decreased by the recorded absence time .

title : Set Up Marketing Campaigns in Dynamics NAV
You can create a campaign card for each campaign that you want to keep track of . You can also view these campaign cards to view general information about your campaigns .
You can delete campaign entries , such as if the entry records an action that has been canceled . Only canceled campaign entries can be deleted .
# # # Selecting the target audience
# # # Registering discount percentages
When you have set up the sales prices / line discounts and the segments on the campaign card , you must activate them so that the campaign prices / discounts will be reflected on the lines .
As a campaign runs , all interactions with your contacts , or segment , are recorded so that you can get statistics and other information about the costs and success rates of the campaign .
# The Quickbooks Payroll File Import Extension to Dynamics NAV
To account for salary payments and related transactions , you must import and post financial transactions made by your payroll provider to the general ledger .
The Quickbooks Payroll File Import extension allows you to import payroll transaction from the Quickbooks Payroll service .
title : Work with Dimensions
To make it simpler to perform analysis on documents such as sales orders , you can use dimensions . Dimensions are attributes and values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them . For example , dimensions can indicate the project or department an entry came from .
Another example is to set up a dimension called * Department * , and use this dimension when you post sales documents . This will let you use business intelligence tools to see which department sold which items .
The more dimensions you use , the more detailed reports you can base your business decisions on . For example , a single sales entry can include multiple dimension information , such as :
* The account the item sale was posted to
* Where the item was sold
* Who sold it
* The kind of customer who bought it
A dimension set is a unique combination of dimension values . It is stored as dimension set entries in the database . Each dimension set entry represents a single dimension value . The dimension set is identified by a common dimension set ID that is assigned to each dimension set entry that belongs to the dimension set .
You can also set up some global and shortcut dimensions :
# # # Translating the Names of Dimensions
# # # Example of Dimension Setup
&#124; AREA &#124; Area &#124; Area Code &#124; Area Filter &#124;
&#124; DEPARTMENT &#124; Department &#124; Department Code &#124; Department Filter &#124;
If you work in a journal instead , you can add dimension information to an entry in the same way , if you have set up shortcut dimensions as fields directly on journal lines .
You can set up default dimensions for accounts or account types , so that dimensions and dimension values are filled in automatically .
title : Create Incoming Documents From Documents
# How to : Create Incoming Document Records Directly from Documents and Entries
The following procedures show how to attach a file to an existing purchase invoice that was not created from an incoming document record and how to attach a file to a vendor ledger entry . Attaching a file to posted purchase or sales documents works in a similar way .
# # To create and connect an incoming document record from a purchase invoice
# # To create and connect an incoming document record from a vendor ledger entry
# # To remove a connection from an incoming document record to a posted document
You can remove file attachments from non-posted documents at any time by deleting the related incoming document record . If the document is posted , then you must first remove the connection from the incoming document record .
The connection to the posted document is removed . You can now proceed to connect another incoming document record to the posted document as described in this topic .

The marketing manager sets up a campaign , creates a segment that contains all the new contacts and then mines the contact data to select the target audience for the campaign .
The staffer helps send out thank you letters to all the contacts who left their cards with the staff at the stand , and finally , the manager records all the responses they receive from the prospective customers .
# # Setting Up a Campaign
As soon as the staffer has entered the business cards received at the trade show , the marketing manager sets up a campaign card to manage the activities involved in the campaign .
# # # To set up a campaign
# # Selecting the Target Audience
The marketing manager creates a segment to select the contacts that he wants to interact with .
After entering general information about the segment , select the contacts to be included in the segment .
You can use a variety of criteria to select contacts , for example , you can select contact persons who work at a customer site or a prospective customer site who are responsible for purchases at their company .
&gt; You can save your segmentation criteria to be reused at a later stage .
The marketing manager takes a closer look at the segmented list of contacts and realizes that the list is much too big . He decides to reduce the list based on actual , prospective customers to make sure he focuses on the correct target group . This process of refining and reducing the data is also referred to as data mining .
&gt; The contacts that you just removed are added back to the list of contacts .
# # Linking a Segment to a Campaign
The marketing manager decides that the reduced list is the final list of contacts that he wants to be part of the campaign . He therefore links this segment to the campaign FUTURUS trade show .
# # Sending Letters and Email Messages to Contacts
The marketing staffer helps the marketing manager send out correspondence to the prospective customers , in which he thanks them for visiting the trade show .
&gt; This template consists of more than one attachment document , each of them written in a different language . Example languages include English and Danish .
This opens the attached Word document so that you can inspect it . You can also take this opportunity to edit and modify the letter . Close Word when you are finished .
10 . After the segment is logged , each letter that is sent is recorded as an interaction , which you can view in the log .
# # # To send an email message to a contact
4 . Specify language settings , as in the previous procedure .
During the next couple of weeks , the prospective customers respond to the letter . The marketing manager wants to keep track of the responses and record these interactions .
For this purpose , set up a segment for the contacts who have responded to the letter .
# # # To register campaign responses
There is no interaction template for recording responses to campaigns . Therefore , create a new template .
Now specify that these contacts have responded to the campaign :
Log the segment to make sure that the interactions are recorded .
title : About Calculating Standard Cost
# # Setting Up Standard Costs
The accounting task for an item-processing company using standard costing is to :
- Record and allocate the actual cost of the key cost elements and to account for variances .
To determine the direct cost of a finished item , all component costs must be totaled . An assembled or produced item can include subassemblies , which also consist of multiple components .
The following key cost elements make up the total direct cost of a finished processed item :
- Subcontracting costs for produced items only .
Material costs are costs that are associated with subassemblies and purchased raw material . Material unit cost can consist of direct and indirect cost elements .
- Direct material cost represents an invoiced amount for purchased raw materials or the processing cost of a subassembly .
The material cost of a produced item can be represented in two ways that correspond to the following cost calculation bases .
&#124; Cost Calculation Basis &#124; Material Cost Calculation &#124;
&#124; Single level &#124; Produced item is equal to the total cost of all purchased or subassembled items on that item &apos;s production BOM . &#124;
The setup of the capacity costs of assembled items consists of the following elements :
- Direct and indirect unit cost of the resource .
- Fixed or direct resource usage type .
The setup of the capacity costs of produced items consists of the following elements :
- Direct and indirect unit cost of the machine or work center .
- Time and lot size setup .
To calculate standard capacity cost , you have to establish the standard time rates that are required to perform operations on machine and work centers . The total time to complete an operation typically consists of setup , run time , and wait and move time .
You set up the rates for each time type for each machine or work center on an individual routing .
Because subcontracting is an outsourced capacity , you set up the cost of both direct and indirect subcontracting services on the work center card that represents the subcontracting operation .
To update or calculate the standard cost of assembly items , use the function from the item card .

If you have made an incorrect negative quantity posting , such as a purchase order with the wrong number of items and posted it as received but not invoiced , then you can undo the posting .
If you have made an incorrect positive quantity posting , such as a purchase return order with the wrong number of items and posted it as shipped but not invoiced , then you can undo the posting .
# # To undo a quantity posting on a posted purchase receipt
2 . Open the posted receipt that you want to undo .
3 . Select the line or lines that you want to undo .
A corrective line is inserted under the selected receipt line .

title : Design Details - Item Application
# Design Details : Item Application
&#124; Quantity application &#124; Created for all inventory transactions &#124;
&#124; Cost application &#124; Created for inbound entries together with a quantity application as a result of user interaction in special processes . &#124;
Item applications can be made in the following ways .
&#124; Automatic &#124; Occurs as general cost forwarding according to the costing method &#124; Quantity application &#124;
Whether quantity applications or cost applications are made depends on the direction of the inventory transaction and whether the item application is made automatically or fixed , in connection with special processes .
The following table shows , based on the central application fields on inventory transaction lines , how costs flow depending on the transaction direction . It also indicates when and why the item application is of type quantity or cost .
&#124; &#124; Appl.-to Item Entry field &#124; Appl.-from Item Entry field &#124;
&gt; A sales return is NOT considered a cost source when fixed applied .
&gt; The sales entry remains open until the real source is posted .
An item application entry records the following information .
The following table shows the item application entry that is created when you post a purchase receipt of 10 units .
The following example shows the item application entry that is created when you post a sales shipment of 5 units of the items that were received in the previous example . The first item application entry is the purchase receipt . The second application entry is the sales shipment .
The following table shows the two item application entries that result from the inventory increase and the inventory decrease , respectively .
You make a fixed application when you specify that the cost of an inventory increase should apply to a specific inventory decrease , or vice versa . The fixed application affects the remaining quantities of the entries , but the fixed application also reverses the exact cost of the original entry that you are applying to , or from .
# # # Example – Fixed Application in Purchase Return
The following example , which illustrates the effect of fixed application of a purchase return of an item using the FIFO costing method , is based on the following scenario :
1 . In entry number 1 , the user posts a purchase at a cost of LCY 10.00 .
2 . In entry number 2 , the user posts a purchase at a cost of LCY 20.00 .
The following table shows item ledger entries resulting from the scenario .
Because a fixed application is made from the purchase return to the second purchase entry , the items are returned at the correct cost . If the user had not performed the fixed application , then the returned item would be incorrectly valued at LCY 10.00 because the return would have been applied to the first purchase entry according to the FIFO principle .
The following table shows the item application entry that results from the fixed application .
The cost of the second purchase , LCY 20.00 , is passed correctly to the purchase return .
# # # Example – Fixed Application with Average Cost
The following example , which illustrates the effect of fixed application , is based on the following scenario for an item that uses the Average costing method :
3 . In entry number 4 , the user posts another purchase invoice with the correct direct unit cost of LCY 100.00
4 . In entry number 5 , the user posts a sales invoice .
5 . The inventory quantity is 0 , and the inventory value is also 0.00
The following table shows the result of the scenario on the item ’ s value entries .
If the user had not made the fixed application between the purchase credit memo and the purchase with the incorrect direct unit cost ( step 2 in the previous scenario ) , then the cost would have been adjusted differently .
# # # Example – Fixed Application in Sales Return
Fixed applications are also a very good means of reversing cost exactly , such as with sales returns .
The following example , which illustrates how a fixed application ensures exact cost reversal , is based on the following scenario :
1 . The user posts a purchase invoice .
2 . The user posts a sales invoice .
4 . A freight cost , related to the purchase order that was posted earlier , arrives . The user posts it as an item charge .
The following table shows the result of scenario steps 1 through 3 on the item ’ s value entries .
The following table shows the value entry resulting from scenario step 4 , posting the item charge .
The following table shows the effect of the exact cost reversal on the item ’ s value entries .
# # # Example – Average Costing Method
The following example , which illustrates how transfer entries are applied , is based on the following scenario for an item using Average costing method and an average cost period of Day .
1 . The user purchases the item at a cost of LCY 10.00 .
2 . The user purchases the item again at a cost of LCY 20.00 .
3 . The user transfers the item from BLUE to RED location .
The following table shows the effect of the transfer on the item ’ s value entries .
# # # Example – Standard Costing Method
1 . The user purchases the item at a standard cost of LCY 10.00 .
2 . The user transfers the item from BLUE to RED location at a standard cost of LCY 12.00 .
Since the value of the original inventory increase is LCY 10.00 , the transfer is valued at that cost , not at LCY 12.00 .
* You have forgotten to make a fixed application .
* You have made an incorrect fixed application .
* You want to overrule the application created automatically when posting , according to the item ’ s costing method .

1 . Deleted fields , labels , or data items .
2 . Duplicate field names in the report layout after a field has been renamed in the dataset . This should be treated as a design error .
3 . Upgrade scenarios where there are multiple iterations of a report layout that causes multiple rename actions on the same fields , labels or data items .
If you get an error message when you update or test report layout updates , you most likely will have to modify the report layout to fix the problem . Read the error message to help determine the cause of the problem .
After you modify the layout , try to update the layout again .
title : Managing Inventory Costs
Central principles to understand are that costing methods define how items are valued when they leave inventory , that cost adjustment updates the cost of goods sold with related purchase costs posted after the sale , and that inventory values must be posted to dedicated G / L accounts at regular intervals .
title : Design Details - Dealing with Orders Before the Planning Starting Date
To avoid that a supply plan shows impossible and therefore useless suggestions , the planning system regards the period up until the planning starting date a frozen zone where nothing is planned for . The following rule applies to the frozen zone :
All supply and demand before the starting date of the planning period will be considered a part of inventory or shipped .
The exceptions to this rule are as follows :
* If the projected available inventory , including the sum of supply and demand in the frozen zone , is below zero .
* If serial / lot numbers are required on the backdated order ( s ) .
* If the supply-demand set is linked by an order-to-order policy .
# # Serial / Lot Numbers and Order-to-Order Links are Exempt from the Frozen Zone

# How to : Set Up Unrealized VAT for Cash-Based Accounting
# # To use general ledger accounts for unrealized VAT
You can choose to have VAT amounts calculated and posted to a temporary general ledger account when an invoice is posted , and then posted to the correct general ledger account and included in VAT statements when the actual payment of the invoice is posted . Before you can do this , you must complete the VAT posting setup .
To use accounts for unrealized VAT , follow these steps :
&#124; Blank &#124; Choose this option if you don &apos;t want to use the unrealized VAT feature . &#124;
&#124; Percentage &#124; Payments covers both VAT and the invoice amount in proportion to the payment &apos;s percentage of the remaining invoice amount . The paid VAT amount is transferred from the unrealized VAT account to the realized VAT account . &#124;
&gt; The VAT amount will be posted to this account , and stay there until the customer payment is posted . The amount is then transferred to the account for sales VAT .
title : Design Details - The Role of the Reorder Point
# Design Details : The Role of the Reorder Point
In addition to the general balancing of supply and demand , the planning system must also monitor inventory levels for the affected items to respect the defined reordering policies .
Accordingly , the planning system will suggest a forward-scheduled supply order at the point when the projected inventory passes below the reorder point .
The reorder point reflects a certain inventory level . However , inventory levels can move significantly during the time bucket and , therefore , the planning system must constantly monitor the projected available inventory .
title : Design Details - The Concept of Balancing in Brief
# Design Details : The Concept of Balancing in Brief
The inventory profiles are used to contain information about the demands and supplies , quantities , and timing . These profiles essentially make up the two sides of the balancing scale .
The objective of the planning mechanism is to counterbalance the demand and supply of an item to ensure that supply will match demand in a feasible way as defined by the planning parameters and rules .

title : How to Assign Serial Numbers and Lot Numbers to Items for Tracking
# How to : Work with Serial and Lot Numbers
# # About Picking Serial or Lot Numbers in the Warehouse
Outbound handling of serial or lot numbers is a frequent task in different warehouse processes .
In some processes , the inventory items do not carry serial or lot numbers , and the warehouse worker must assign new during the outbound handling , typically from a predefined number series .
In simple processes , the inventory items already carry serial or lot numbers , for example assigned during the put-away , and these numbers are automatically transferred through all outbound warehouse activities without interaction by warehouse workers .
# # Item Tracking Availability
# # To set up item tracking codes
An item tracking code reflects the different considerations a company has regarding the use of serial and lot numbers for items moving through the inventory .
# # # To set up expiration rules for serial or lot numbers
For some items you might want to set up specific expiration dates and rules in the item tracking code . This functionality allows you to keep track of when specific serial numbers and lot numbers expire .
# # # To set up warranties for serial or lot numbers
For some items , you might want to set up specific warranties in the item tracking code . This functionality allows you to keep track of when the warranties on specific serial or lot numbers in your inventory will run out .
# # To record serial or lot number information
If you need to link special information to a specific item tracking number , for example , for quality assurance , you can do so in a serial or lot number information card .
1 . Open a document that has serial or lot numbers assigned .
# # To modify existing serial or lot number information
2 . Select an item that has an item tracking code and has serial or lot number information .
# # To assign serial or lot numbers during an inbound transaction
You can assign serial or lot numbers in the following ways :
- Manually , by assigning a specific number to each item unit .
When the document is posted , the item tracking entries are carried to the associated item ledger entries .
# # To assign a serial or lot number during an outbound transaction
There are two ways to add serial and lot numbers to outbound transactions :
- Assigning new serial or lot numbers during outbound transactions . This applies when item tracking numbers are not assigned to items until they are sold and ready to be shipped .
You can assign item tracking numbers in the following ways :
- Manually , by entering serial or lot numbers , without using a number series .
# # To select from existing serial or lot numbers
When you are working with items that require item tracking and you are creating outbound transactions , where the items go out of inventory , you typically need to select the lot or serial numbers from those that already exist in inventory .
The exact rules for handling item tracking numbers across your company are governed by the setup of the * * Item Tracking Code * * table .
&gt; To handle item tracking numbers in warehouse activities , the item must be set up with SN / Lot Warehouse Tracking , as this dictates the special principles governing serial and lot numbers in the warehouse .
1 . From any outbound document , select the line that you want to select serial or lot numbers for .
6 . Type or scan in the item tracking number .
When you post the document line , the item tracking information is transferred to the associated item ledger entries .
# # To handle serial and lot numbers on transfer orders
Procedures for handling serial and lot numbers that are being transferred between different locations are similar to those applied when items are sold and purchased .
When handling serial and lot numbers for transfer items , the items typically have numbers already assigned to them . Therefore , the process typically consists of selecting from existing serial or lot numbers .
4 . Post the transfer order , first ship and then receive , to record that the items are transferred carrying their item tracking entries .
# # To handle serial and lot numbers when getting receipt lines from a purchase invoice
When you use functionality to get posted receipt or shipment lines from related invoices or credit memos , then any item tracking lines on the warehouse documents are transferred automatically , however , they are processed in a special way .
The functionality supports the following inbound processes :
The functionality supports the following outbound processes :
2 . Open a purchase invoice for items that are purchase with serial or lot numbers .
5 . In the purchase invoice , select the transferred receipt line .
# # To reclassify serial or lot numbers
Reclassifying item tracking for an item means changing a lot or serial number to a new lot or serial number or changing the expiration date to a new expiration date . If you are working with lots , you can also merge multiple lots into one . You perform these tasks using the item reclassification journal .
6 . If you have existing information on the old serial or lot number , you can copy it to the new serial or lot number .
7 . If you want to modify the existing information for the lot or serial number , you can record lot or serial information .
8 . Post the journal to link the renewed item tracking numbers or expiration dates to the associated item ledger entry

These posting groups are chosen on the item card :
* General product posting group
* Inventory posting group
When you create a sales document , the sales header uses the customer card information , and the sales lines use the item card information .
* The revenue posting ( income statement ) is determined by the combination of the general business posting group and the general product posting group .
* The accounts receivable posting ( balance sheet ) is determined by the customer posting group .
* The inventory posting ( balance sheet ) is determined by the inventory posting group .
* The cost of goods sold posting ( income statement ) is determined by the combination of general business posting group and general product posting group .

title : About Production Orders
Production orders are used to manage the conversion of purchased materials into manufactured items . Production orders route work through various work or machine centers on the shop floor .
Before proceeding with production , most companies perform supply planning , typically once a week , to calculate how many production orders and purchase orders to execute to fulfill that week ’ s sales demand . Purchase orders supply the components that are required according to the production BOM to produce the end items .
Production orders are the central components of the program &apos;s manufacturing functionality and they contain the following information :
- Products planned for manufacturing
- Materials required for the planned production orders
- Products that have just been manufactured
- Products that have been manufactured in the past
- Materials that were used in previous manufacturing operations
Production orders are the starting points for :
- Planning future manufacturing
- Controlling current manufacturing
- Tracking of finished manufacturing
Production orders are created using information from :

The Planned Production Order is unique because of the following characteristics :
- You can automatically create a planned production order from a sales order .
- To view their impact , look at the load for each work center or machine center on the planned production order &apos;s routing .
# # # Firm Planned Production Order
The Firm Planned Production Order is unique because of the following characteristics :
- You can automatically create a firm planned production order from a sales order .
- A firm planned production order acts as a placeholder in the planning schedule for some future job released to the floor .
- A firm planned production order can be generated from planning or created manually or from sales orders . They are not erased during subsequent planning .
- To view their impact , look at the load for each work center or machine center on the firm planned production order &apos;s routing .
# # # Released Production Order
The Released Production Order is unique based on the following characteristics :
- You can automatically create a released production order from a sales order .
- When a production order has been released , it does not necessarily mean that materials have been picked or the job has physically moved to its first operation .
- In a MTO ( Make-to-Order ) environment , it is not unusual to create a released production order immediately after the entry of the sales order .
- Actual material consumption and product output can be recorded manually with a released production order . In addition , automatic flushing of consumption and product output only occurs for released production orders .
# # # Finished Production Order
The Finished Production Order is unique based on the following characteristics :
- A finished production order is typically one that has been manufactured .
- Finishing the production order is an important task in completing the costing lifecycle of the item that is being produced . By finishing a production order , costing can be adjusted and reconciled .
- Finished production orders can never be changed .
# # Production Order Execution
- Materials picked or consumed
- How much time was spent working on the order
- Quantity of the parent item produced
This information can be recorded manually or through automatic reporting , according to the items setup in the Flushing Method field .
The program offers a variety of options for how a manufacturing company might want to record material consumption . For example , material consumption may be recorded manually , which might be desirable if there are frequent component substitutions or greater than expected scrap .
Consumption of materials may be processed through the consumption journal , but also may be recorded automatically by the program , known as automatic reporting . The reporting methods are :
Manual consumption reporting uses the consumption journal to specify material picking .
- All items in the top-level production BOM need to have forward flushing selected on their respective item card .
- All routing link codes on the production BOM must be removed .
- Forward Flush the Entire Order
- Forward Flushing by Operation
- Back Flushing by Operation
- Back Flushing the Entire Order
# # # # Automatic Reporting - Forward Flush the Entire Order
If you forward flush the production order at the start of the job , the behavior of the program is very similar to a manual consumption . The major difference is that consumption happens automatically .
- The entire contents of the production BOM are consumed and deducted from inventory at the time the released production order is refreshed .
- The consumption quantity is the quantity per assembly stated on the production BOM , multiplied by the number of parent items you are building .
- There is no need to record any information in the consumption journal if all of the items are to be flushed .
- When consuming items from inventory , it does not matter when output journal entries are made , because the output journal has no effect on this mode of consumption posting .
Forward flushing an entire order is suited in production environments with :
- A low number of defects
- A low number of operations
- High component consumption in early operations
# # # # Automatic Reporting - Forward Flushing by Operation
Flushing by operation allows you to deduct inventory during a specific operation in the routing of the parent item . Material is tied to the routing using routing link codes , which correspond to routing link codes applied to components in the production BOM .
The flush takes place when the operation that has the same routing link code is started . Started means that some activity is recorded in the output journal for that operation . And that activity might just be that a setup time is entered .
The amount of the flush is for the quantity per assembly stated on the production BOM multiplied by the number of parent items being built ( expected quantity ) .
Material can be consumed during operations by using routing link codes . Some components may not be used until final assembly operations and should not be withdrawn from stock until that time .
# # # # Automatic Reporting - Back Flushing by Operation
Back flushing by operation records consumption after the operation is posted in the output journal .
The advantage of this method is that the number of parent parts finished in the operation is known .
Material in the production BOM is linked to the routing records using routing link codes . The back flush takes place when an operation with a particular routing link code is posted with a finished quantity .
The amount of the flush is for the quantity per assembly stated on the production BOM multiplied by the number of parent items that were posted as output quantity at that operation . This might be different from the expected quantity .
# # # # Automatic Reporting - Back Flushing the Entire Order
This reporting method does not consider routing link codes .
No components are picked until the released production order status is changed to * Finished * . The amount of the flush is the quantity per assembly stated on the production BOM multiplied by the number of parent items that were finished and placed into inventory .
The program provides you with the capability to track how much time is spent working on a production order , in addition to recording the quantity produced . This information can help you more accurately determine the costs of production . Also , manufacturers using a standard costing system may want to record actual information in order to help them develop better standards .
Manual method uses the Output Journal to specify time consumed and quantity produced .
Backward method records the expected output ( and time ) , which is automatically recorded at the finish of a Production Order . Routing link codes are not a factor in the back flushing of the output .
# # # Posting Consumption and Output
The Production Journal combines the functions of the Consumption Journal and Output Journals into one journal , which is accessed directly from the Released Production Order .
The purpose of the Production Journal is to provide a single interface for you to register consumption and output from a Production Order .
The Production Journal has a simple view and provides you with the ability to :
- Easily record output and consumption related to a Production Order
- Relate the components to operations
- Relate actual operation data with the standard estimates on the Production Order routing and component lines
- Post and print an overview of registered operation data for the Production Order
The Production Journal performs many of the same functions as the Consumption and Output journals . Dimensions , Item Tracking , and Bin Contents are handled in the same way as on the Consumption and Output journals .
However , the Production Journal differs from the Consumption and Output journals in the following ways :
- It is called directly from a released production order line and preset with the relevant data .
- It allows you to define which types of components to handle based on a flushing method filter on the journal .
- Quantities and times already posted for the order are displayed at the bottom of the journal as actual entries .
- Fields where data entry is irrelevant are blank and non-editable .
- The user can set up the way output quantities are preset in the journal - for example , that the last operation must have zero as Output Quantity .
- If you happen to exit the journal without posting your changes , a request message is displayed allowing you to stay in the journal .
- It displays operations and components together in a logical structure that provides an overview of the production process .
In the production journal , consumption quantities are posted as negative item ledger entries , output quantities are posted as positive ledger entries , and times spent are posted as capacity ledger entries .
Set 1 is based on international reports . You cannot print Norwegian giro or use paper sources / trays in this set of reports .
The first document set consists of standard reports that do not contain any settings specific to Norway . For example , giro transactions are not printed and paper sources / trays cannot be processed .

title : Use Purchase Credit Memos to Process Returns or Cancellations
# How to : Process Purchase Returns or Cancellations
If you want to return items to your vendor or cancel services that you have purchased , then you can create and post a purchase credit memo that specifies the requested change with regard to the original purchase invoice . To include the correct purchase invoice information , you can create the purchase credit memo directly from the posted purchase invoice or you can create a new purchase credit memo with copied invoice information .
Typically , you create a purchase credit memo or purchase return order in reaction to a credit memo sent to you by a vendor . The purchase credit memo or purchase return order functions as your internal documentation of the credit memo process for accounting purposes or to control the shipping of the involved items .
In addition to the original posted purchase invoice , you can apply the purchase credit memo or purchase return order to other purchase documents , for example another posted purchase invoice because you are also returning items delivered with that invoice .
The credit memo posting will also revert any item charges that were assigned to the posted document , so that the item ’ s value entries are the same as before the item charge was assigned .
To preserve correct inventory valuation , you typically want to pick return items from inventory at the unit cost that they were purchased at , not at their current unit cost . This is referred to as exact cost reversing .
Two functions exist to assign exact cost reversing automatically .
# # To create a purchase credit memo from a posted purchase invoice
Most fields on the purchase credit memo header are filled with the information from the posted purchase invoice . You can edit all the fields , for example with new information that reflects the return agreement .
3 . Edit information on the lines according to the agreement , such as the number of items returned or the amount to be reimbursement .
When you have created or edited the needed purchase credit memo lines and the single or multiple applications are specified , you can proceed to post the purchase credit memo .
The purchase credit memo is removed and replaced with a new document in the list of posted purchase credit memos .
# # To create a purchase credit memo by copying a posted purchase invoice
9 . Complete the purchase credit memo as explained in the &quot; To create a purchase credit memo from a posted purchase invoice &quot; section in this topic .
# # To create a purchase return order based on one or more a posted purchase documents
&gt; This field only works for posted receipts and posted invoice lines , not for posted return or posted credit memo lines .
At the left side of the window , the different document types are listed , and the number in brackets shows the number of documents available of each document type .
8 . Select the lines that you would like to copy to the new document .
The following processes occur :
- If the copied document is a posted invoice or credit memo , the unit price , invoice discounts , and line discounts from the posted document line are copied .
# # To create a replacement purchase order from a purchase return order
You may agree with your vendor that they compensate you for a purchased item by replacing the item . The replacement item can be the same or it can be different . This situation could occur if the vendor mistakenly shipped the wrong item .
You can post this reduced purchase cost as an item charge on a credit memo or return order and link it to the posted receipt . The following describes it for a purchase return order , but the same steps apply to a purchase credit memo .
3 . Fill in the credit memo header with information about the vendor who sent you the purchase allowance .
You may want to create a special item charge number to cover purchase allowances .
When you post the purchase return order , the purchase allowance is added to the relevant purchase entry amount . In this way , you can maintain accurate inventory valuation .
# # To combine return shipments
When you ship the items , you post the related purchase return orders as shipped and this creates posted purchase return shipments .
When you are ready to invoice these items , instead of invoicing each purchase return order separately , you can create a purchase credit memo and automatically copy the posted purchase return shipment lines to this document . Then you can post the purchase credit memo and conveniently invoice all the open purchase return orders at the same time .
&gt; The following procedure assumes that there are several purchase return orders for the vendor , and that they have been posted as shipped .
5 . Select multiple return shipment lines that you want to include in the invoice .
# # # To remove open purchase return orders after combined return shipment posting

title : Design Details - Integration with Inventory
# Design Details : Integration with Inventory
The Warehouse Management application area and the Inventory application area interact with one another in physical inventory and in inventory or warehouse adjustment .
If the counted quantity is greater than the quantity on the journal line , a movement is posted for this difference from the default adjustment bin to the counted bin . This increases the quantity in the counted bin and decreases the quantity in the default adjustment bin .
If the quantity counted is less than the quantity on the journal line , a movement for this difference is posted from the counted bin to the default adjustment bin . This decreases the quantity in the counted bin and increases the quantity in the default adjustment bin .
When you post the physical inventory journal , the inventory and the default adjustment bin are updated .
# # # Warehouse Adjustments to the Item Ledger
&gt; The adjustment bin is not included in the availability calculation .
If you want to adjust the bin content , you can use the warehouse item journal , from which you can enter the item number , zone code , bin code , and quantity that you want to adjust .
If you enter a positive quantity and post the line , then the inventory stored in the bin increases , and the quantity of the default adjustment bin decreases correspondingly .
title : Design Details - Availability in the Warehouse
# Design Details : Availability in the Warehouse
The system must keep a constant control of item availability in the warehouse , so that outbound orders can flow efficiently and provide optimal deliveries .
Availability varies depending on allocations at the bin level when warehouse activities such as picks and movements occur and when the inventory reservation system imposes restrictions to comply with . A rather complex algorithm verifies that all conditions are met before allocating quantities to picks for outbound flows .
# # Bin Content and Reservations
Special functionality in the picking algorithm exists to calculate the quantity that is available to pick when bin content is coupled with reservations .
# # Quantity Available to Pick
# # # Calculating the Quantity Available to Pick
The quantity available to pick is calculated as follows :
The following diagram shows the different elements of the calculation .
# # Quantity Available to Reserve
Because the concepts of bin content and reservation co-exist , the quantity of items that are available to reserve must be aligned with allocations to outbound warehouse documents .
It should be possible to reserve all items in inventory , except those that have started outbound processing . Accordingly , the quantity that is available to reserve is defined as the quantity on all documents and all bin types , except the following outbound quantities :
- Quantity on unregistered pick documents
- Quantity in shipment bins
- Quantity in to-production bins
- Quantity in open shop floor bins
- Quantity in to-assembly bins
- Quantity in adjustment bins
The quantity available to reserve is calculated as follows :
title : Design Details - Balancing Supply with Demand
# Design Details : Balancing Supply with Demand
The core of the planning system involves balancing demand and supply by means of suggesting user actions to revise the supply orders in case of imbalance . This takes place per combination of variant and location .
2 . Demand exists but there is no supply = &gt; supply should be suggested .
4 . Both demand and supply exist = &gt; questions should be asked and answered before the system can ensure that demand will be met and supply is sufficient .
If the timing of the supply is not suitable , perhaps the supply can be rescheduled as follows :
1 . If the supply is placed earlier than the demand , perhaps the supply can be rescheduled out so that inventory is as low as possible .
3 . If the supply meets the demand on the date , the planning system can proceed to investigate whether the quantity of the supply can cover the demand .
Once the timing is in place , the adequate quantity to be supplied can be calculated as follows :
At this point , either of these two situations exists :
6 . The current demand can be covered , in which case it can be closed and planning for the next demand can start .
7 . The supply has reached its maximum , leaving some of the demand quantity uncovered . In this case , the planning system can close the current supply and proceed to the next one .
The procedure starts all over with the next demand and the current supply or vice versa . The current supply might be able to cover this next demand as well , or the current demand has not yet been fully covered .
# # Rules Concerning Actions for Supply Events
In general , all supply has a planning flexibility that is limited by the conditions of each of the suggested actions .
- It represents inventory ( always on day zero ) .
- It has an order-to-order linked to another demand .
- It lies outside the reschedule window defined by the time bucket .
- On the other hand , the user may decide not to reschedule because :
- The supply order has already been tied to another demand on a previous date .
- The needed rescheduling is so minimal that the user finds it negligible .
- It is linked directly to some other demand .
&gt; When planning an item using a reorder point , the supply order can always be scheduled in if necessary . This is common in forward-scheduled supply orders triggered by a reorder point .
&gt; Even though it is possible to increase the supply order , it may be limited due to a defined maximum order quantity .
&gt; Even though the quantity could be decreased , there may still be some surplus compared to the demand due to a defined minimum order quantity or order multiple .
# # Determining the Supply Quantity
Planning parameters defined by the user control the suggested quantity of each supply order .
When the planning system calculates the quantity of a new supply order or the quantity change on an existing one , the suggested quantity may be different from what is actually demanded .
If a maximum inventory or fixed order quantity are selected , the suggested quantity may be increased to meet that fixed quantity or the maximum inventory . If a reordering policy uses a reorder point , the quantity may be increased at least to meet the reorder point .
The suggested quantity may be modified in this sequence :
1 . Down to the maximum order quantity ( if any ) .
2 . Up to the minimum order quantity .
# # Order Tracking Links during Planning
Concerning order tracking during planning , it is important to mention that the planning system rearranges the dynamically created order tracking links for the item / variant / location combinations .
There are two reasons for this :
- The planning system must be able to justify its suggestions ; that all demand has been covered , and that no supply orders are superfluous .
- Dynamically created order tracking links need to be rebalanced regularly .
Before balancing supply by demand , the program deletes all existing order tracking links . Then during the balancing procedure , when a demand or supply event is closed , it establishes new order tracking links between the demand and supply .
&gt; Even if the item is not set up for dynamic order tracking , the planned system will create balanced order tracking links as explained above .

- The entries have dimension values corresponding to either a cost center or a cost object .
- The document number in the entries is empty , so it will appear with a document number of 0000 in the cost entries .
- The entries are transferred to a cost type that allows for combined entries and these entries are transferred as a combined entry either monthly or daily .
General ledger entries are not transferred if :
- The entries have dimension values that do not correspond to a cost center or a cost object .
- The entries have an amount of zero .
- The entries have a general ledger account that has been deleted .
- The entries have a general ledger account that is not assigned a cost type .

title : Design Details - Average Cost
The valuation date is set automatically .
# # Setting Up Average Cost Calculation
&gt; You can only use one average cost period and one average cost calculation type in a fiscal year .
- Determines the cost of the item at the start of the average cost period .
- Subtracts the sum of the costs of any outbound transactions that were fixed-applied to receipts in the average cost period . These typically include purchase returns and negative outputs .
- Divides by the total inventory quantity for the end of the average cost period , excluding inventory decreases that are being valued .
&gt; The valuation date is set to the last day in the average cost period , which in this case is the last day of the month .
# # Setting the Valuation Date
The following table shows the criteria that are used to set the valuation date .
The following table of value entries illustrates the different scenarios .
If the quantity on inventory is less than zero after posting the inventory decrease , then the valuation date is first set to the posting date of the inventory decrease . This date may be changed later , according to the rules described in the note earlier in this section , when the inventory increase is applied .
Valuing inventory decreases as a weighted average would be straightforward if purchases were always invoiced before sales are invoiced , postings were never backdated , and you never made mistakes . However , the reality is somewhat different from this ideal .
As illustrated in the examples in this topic , the valuation date is defined as the date from which the value entry is included in the average cost calculation . This gives you the flexibility to do the following for items using the Average costing method :
- Invoice the sale of an item before the purchase of the item has been invoiced .
- Backdate a posting .
- Recover an incorrect posting .
The following table shows the value entries that exist for the item before the posting is introduced .
The following table shows the value entries that exist for the item after entry number 5 is introduced .

&gt; You cannot set up the warehouse to use bins when the location has open item ledger entries .
You can also define warehouse class codes , if the warehouse carries items that need various storage conditions . Warehouse class codes are used when suggesting item placement in bins . You assign the warehouse class codes to product groups , which are then assigned to items and SKUs , or to zones and bins that can accommodate the storage conditions required by the warehouse class codes .
# # To set up a zone in your warehouse
When you change a zone parameter , all bins created thereafter in that zone will have the new characteristics , but the original bins will not be changed .

title : Design Details - Reconciliation with the General Ledger
# Design Details : Reconciliation with the General Ledger
There are two ways to reconcile the inventory ledger with the general ledger :
* Automatically , every time that you post an inventory transaction .
# # Post Inventory Cost to G / L Batch Job
The posting dates of the general ledger entries are set to the posting date of the corresponding value entry , except when the value entry falls in a closed accounting period . In this case , the value entry is skipped , and you must change either the general ledger setup or the user setup to enable posting in the date range .
The entry type indicates which general ledger account to post to . This is determined either by the sign of the quantity on the item ledger entry or the valued quantity on the value entry , since the quantities always have the same sign . For example , a sales entry with a positive quantity describes an inventory decrease caused by a sale , and a sales entry with a negative quantity describes an inventory increase caused by a sales return .
The following example shows a bike chain that is manufactured from purchased links . This example shows how the various general ledger account types are used in a typical scenario .
The following table shows how the link is set up on the item card .
The following table shows how the chain is set up on the item card .

title : Design Details - Prioritizing Orders
# Design Details : Prioritizing Orders
Loaded demand and supply contribute to a profile for the projected inventory according to the following priorities :
# # Priorities on the Demand Side
1 . Already shipped : Item Ledger Entry
5 . Production Component Need
6 . Assembly Order Line
7 . Outbound Transfer Order
8 . Blanket Order ( that has not already been consumed by related sales orders )
9 . Forecast ( that has not already been consumed by other sales orders )
&gt; Purchase returns are usually not involved in supply planning ; they should always be reserved from the lot that is going to be returned . If not reserved , purchase returns play a role in the availability and are highly prioritized to avoid that the planning system suggests a supply order just to serve a purchase return .
# # Priorities on the Supply Side
3 . Inbound Transfer Order
# # Priority Related to the State of Demand and Supply
2 . Already in process in the warehouse ( Planning Flexibility = None )
4 . Firm Planned Production Order ( Planning Flexibility = Unlimited )

title : How to Subcontract Manufacturing
Subcontracting selected operations to vendor is common in many manufacturing companies . Subcontracting can be a rare occurrence or can be an integral part of all production processes .
The program provides several tools for managing subcontract work :
Subcontract Work Centers are set up the same as regular work centers with additional information . They are assigned to routings in the same manner as other work centers .
# # # Subcontract Work Center Fields
# # # Routings that use Subcontract Work Centers
Subcontract work centers can be used for operations on routings in the same way as regular work centers .
Once you have calculated the subcontracting worksheet , the relevant document , in this case a purchase order , is created .
# # # How to : Calculate Subcontracting Worksheets and Create Subcontract Purchase Orders
# # # To calculate the subcontracting worksheet
# # # To create the subcontract purchase order
If all subcontracted operations are sent to the same vendor location , then only one purchase order is created .
The worksheet line that was turned into a purchase order is deleted from the worksheet . Once a purchase order is created , it will not appear in the worksheet again .
# # Posting Subcontract Purchase Orders
Once the Subcontractor Purchase Orders have been created , they can be posted . Receiving the order posts a Capacity Ledger Entry to the production order and invoicing the order posts the direct cost of the purchase order to the production order .
When the purchase is posted as received , then an output journal entry is automatically posted for the production order . This only applies if the subcontract operation is the last operation on the production order routing .
&gt; Posting output automatically for an ongoing production order when subcontracted items are received may not be desired . Reasons for this could be that the expected output quantity that is posted may be different from the actual quantity and that the posting date of the automatic output is misleading .
# # To post a subcontract purchase order
2 . Open a purchase order that is created from the subcontracting worksheet .
When the purchase order is posted as invoiced , then the direct cost of the purchase order is posted to the production .

title : Automatic Breaking Bulk with Directed Put-away and Pick
# How to : Enable Automatic Breaking Bulk with Directed Put-away and Pick
To fulfill a task , the program automatically looks for an item in the same unit of measure . But if it cannot find this form of the item , and this field is selected , the program will suggest that you break a larger unit of measure into the unit of measure that is needed .
If the system can only find smaller units of measure , it will suggest that you gather items to fulfill the quantity on the shipment or production order . In effect , it breaks the larger unit of measure on the source document into smaller units for picking .
In the warehouse put-away , the program automatically suggests Place action lines in the put-away unit of measure , for example , pieces , even though the items arrive in a different unit of measure .
You can view the results of the conversion process from one unit of measure to another as intermediate breakbulk lines in the put-away , pick , or movement instructions .
&gt; If you want your units of measure to perform optimally in the warehouse , also in connection with the breakbulk functionality , you should wherever possible try to :
&gt; - Set up the base unit of measure for an item as the smallest unit of measure that you expect to handle in your warehouse processes .
&gt; - Set up your alternative units of measure for the item as multiples of the base unit of measure .

title : How to Enter Data in Fields
There are many general functions that help you enter data in a quick and easy way . The general functions for entering data are described in this article .
The examples in this article use the demonstration data .
When you enter data on pages , certain fields are marked with a red asterisk . The red asterisk means that the field must be filled to complete a certain process that uses the field , such as posting a transaction that uses the value in the field .
# # Finding Data As You Type
When you start to type characters in a field , a drop-down list is displayed and shows possible field values . The list changes as you type more characters , and you can select the correct value when it is displayed .
- Lookup - Displays information from another table that you can enter in the field . You can select one piece of data at a time .
- Drop-down - Displays the set of options that exist for the field . You can select only one of the options .
# # Entering Quantities by Calculation
- If you enter 41-9 , the field is calculated to 32 .
You can enter negative numbers in two ways . The number -20.5 can be entered as :
In both cases , the amount will be recorded in as -20.5 .
# # Entering Dates and Times
You can enter dates and times in all the fields that are specifically assigned to dates ( date fields ) . You can enter dates with or without separators .
In a date field you can enter two , four , six , or eight digits :
- If you enter only two digits , this is interpreted as the day , and it will add the month and the year of the work date .
- If you enter four digits , this is interpreted as the day and the month , and it will add the year of the work date .
Instead of entering a specific date , you can enter one of two codes .
When you enter times , you can insert any separator sign that you want between the units , but it is not required . You do not have to write minutes , seconds , or AM / PM .
The following table lists the various ways in which times can be entered and how they are interpreted .
You must enter two digits for each unit of time if you do not enter a separator .
When you enter datetimes you must enter a space between the date and the time .
The following table lists the various ways in which you can enter datetimes and how they are interpreted .
&#124; 1.12.02 &#124; 01-12-02 00 : 00 : 00 &#124;
&#124; t time &#124; today &apos;s date actual time &#124;
&#124; t 3 : 3 : 3 &#124; today &apos;s date 03 : 03 : 03 &#124;
&#124; w or workdate &#124; the working date 00 : 00 : 00 &#124;
&#124; m or Monday &#124; Monday of the current week 00 : 00 : 00 &#124;
&#124; we or Wednesday &#124; Wednesday of the current week 00 : 00 : 00 &#124;

&#124; tu 3 : 3 : 3 &#124; Tuesday of the current week 03 : 03 : 03 &#124;
You enter a duration as a number followed by its unit of measure .
Here are some examples .
To see what unit of measure is being used in a duration field , enter a number and see which unit of measure it is converted to .
The number 5 is converted to 5 hrs , if the unit of measure is hours .
A date formula is a short , abbreviated combination of letters and numbers that specifies how to calculate dates . You can enter date formulas in various date calculation fields and in recurring frequency fields in recurring journals .
Here are some examples of how date formulas can be used :
- The date formula in the recurring frequency field in recurring journals determines how often the entry on the journal line will be posted .
- The date formula in the Grace Period field for a specified reminder level determines the period of time that must pass from the due date ( or from the date of the previous reminder ) before a reminder will be created .
- The date formula in the Due Date Calculation field determines how to calculate the due date on the reminder .
&#124; Y &#124; Year ( s ) &#124;
You can construct a date formula in three ways .
The following example shows how current plus a time unit .
&#124; CW &#124; Current week &#124;
&#124; CM &#124; Current month &#124;
The following example shows how a number and a time unit . A number cannot be larger than 9999 .
&#124; 2W &#124; 2 weeks from today &#124;
The following example shows how a time unit and a number .
&#124; D10 &#124; The next 10th day of a month &#124;
&#124; WD4 &#124; The next 4th day of a week ( Thursday ) &#124;
The following example shows how you can combine these three forms as needed .
The following example shows how you can use a minus sign to indicate a date in the past .

2 . On the VAT Product Posting Groups page , set up a new VAT product posting group for import VAT .
# # To verify VAT registration numbers
&gt; To enable the EU VAT Reg . No . Validation Service , you must have administrator permissions .
&gt; There are a couple of things to note about the VIES VAT Number Validation service :
* The service uses the http protocol , which means that data transferred through the service is not encrypted .
Amounts in documents that are not yet posted are rounded and displayed to correspond with the final rounding of amounts that are actually posted . VAT is calculated for a complete document , which means that VAT is calculated based on the sum of all lines with the same VAT identifier in the document .
# # Understanding the VAT Rate Conversion Process
There are , however , a few things that the tool does not convert :
* Sales or purchase orders and invoices where shipments have been posted . These documents are posted using the current VAT rate .
* Drop shipments or special orders .
* Sales or purchase orders with warehouse integration if they are partially shipped or received .
# # # To prepare VAT rate change conversions
Before you set up the VAT rate change tool , you must make the following preparations .
* If you have transactions that use different rates , then they must be separated into different groups either by creating new general ledger accounts for each rate or by using data filters to group transactions according to rate .
* If you create new general ledger accounts , then you must create new general posting groups .
* To reduce the number of documents that get converted , post as many documents as possible and reduce unposted documents to a minimum .
# # # To set up the VAT rate change tool

title : How to Replan or Refresh Production Orders Directly
# How to : Replan or Refresh Production Orders Directly
Based on the changes you have made to the components and routing lines , the Replan function calculates and plans for any new demand for the production order .
The * * Refresh * * function on production orders is typically used after you have done one of the following :
- Created a production order header manually to calculate and create line data for the first time .
- Made changes to the production order header to recalculate all the line data .
The Refresh function calculates changes made to a production order header and does not involve production BOM levels . The function calculates and initiates the values of the component lines and routing lines based on the master data defined in the assigned production BOM and routing , according to the order quantity and due date on the production order ’ s header .
You can either insert the production order lines manually or use the function that calculates the production order lines from the header .
&gt; If you use the Refresh function to recalculate production order lines , the old production order lines are deleted and new lines are calculated .
# # To replan a production order

title : How to Calculate Order Promising Dates
# How to : Calculate Order Promising Dates
If you specify a requested delivery date on a sales order line , then that date is used as the starting point for the following calculations :
- requested delivery date - shipping time = planned shipment date
- planned shipment date - outbound whse. handling time = shipment date
If the items are available to pick on the shipment date , then the sales process can continue . If the items are not available to be picked on the shipment date , then a stock-out warning is displayed .
- shipment date + outbound whse. handling time = planned shipment date
- planned shipment date + shipping time = planned delivery date
- Verifies if the delivery date requested by the customer or promised to the customer is realistic .
- Shipment Date + Outbound Warehouse Handling Time = Planned Shipment Date
- Planned Shipment Date + Shipping Time = Planned Delivery Date
- Planned Delivery Date - Shipping Time = Planned Shipment Date
- Planned Shipment Date - Outbound Warehouse Handling = Shipment Date
The order processor finishes the CTP process by accepting the dates . This means that a planning line and a reservation entry are created for the item before the calculated dates to ensure that the order is fulfilled .

title : About Planning Functionality
The planning system takes all demand and supply data into account , nets the results , and creates suggestions for balancing the supply to meet the demand .
Planning has two elements : demand and supply . These must be held in balance to ensure that the demand is met in a timely and cost-efficient manner .
Another goal of the planning system is to ensure that the inventory does not grow unnecessarily . In the case of decreasing demand , the planning system will suggest that you postpone , decrease in quantity , or cancel existing replenishment orders .
# # Planning with Manual Transfer Orders
The following planning parameters exist on the item or SKU card :
- Maximum Inventory
- Lot Accumulation Period
- Rescheduling Period
- Minimum Order Quantity
- Maximum Order Quantity
Global planning setup fields on the * * Manufacturing Setup * * window include :
- Dynamic Low-Level Code
- Current Production Forecast
- Use Forecast on Locations
- Default Safety Lead Time
- Blank Overflow Level
- Components at Location
- Default Dampener Period
- Default Dampener Quantity
This specifies whether the supply represented by the production order line is considered by the planning system when calculating action messages .
The emergency warning is displayed in two situations :
- The inventory is negative on the planning starting date .
- Back-dated supply or demand events exist .
Any document lines with due dates before the planning starting date are consolidated into one emergency supply order for the item to arrive on the planning starting date .
The exception warning is displayed if the projected available inventory drops below the safety stock quantity .
The planning system will suggest a supply order to meet the demand on its due date . The warning text states the item ’ s safety stock quantity and the date on which it is violated .
Violating the safety stock level is considered an exception because it should not occur if the reorder point has been set correctly .
- The planning starting date is earlier than the work date .
- The planning line suggests to change a released purchase or production order .

4 . Confirm the subsequent message .
title : Multiple Contracts
Depending on your service level agreements with a customer , you may have to handle a service item under more than one service contract .
By handling a service item under multiple contracts , you can do the following :
* Issue different contracts for the same service item .
* Service parts separately .
* Consider different skills that are required to service different aspects of a service item , such as mechanical components and software .
* Specify different response times and frequencies in servicing different parts of a service item .
* Address different kinds of activities to be performed on a service item when the service item requires different types of service in different time periods .
* Select and assign an appropriate contract number to a service item line when you are creating a service order .
* Handle relevant financial information about service items and service level agreements .
You can consider the following examples of using the multiple contracts functionality .
# # Creating Multiple Contracts per Service Item
When you add a service item on a contract line that is registered in other service contracts or contract quotes , a warning message is displayed stating that the service item already belongs to one or more service contracts or contract quotes . If you confirm this message , all relevant service item information is copied to a newly created contract line .
You can manually create a service order for a service item that is registered in multiple active contracts . A service contract is active when it is signed and not expired .
The remittance system handles all error codes which can be sent through the return files . It is not required to manually cancel payments rejected by the bank .
# # Types of Errors
There are two types of remittance errors :
If errors occur during transfer and no return data is created , payments have not been received by the bank .
If the payment file cannot be sent to the bank , you must cancel the payment order in the remittance system .
If there is an error or information is missing with a payment that was sent to the bank , the return will contain a rejection of the payment .

title : Defining and Allocating Costs
Cost allocations move costs and revenues between cost types , cost centers , and cost objects . You can define as many allocations as you need . Each allocation consists of :
- An allocation source .
- One or more allocation targets .
For each allocation target , you define an allocation base . The allocation base can be either static or dynamic .
- Dynamic allocation bases depend on changeable values , such as the number of employees in a cost center or sales revenue of a cost object throughout a certain time period .
title : &quot; How to : Post Inventory Costs to the General Ledger &quot;
You can post inventory costs to the general ledger in two ways :
- Automatically , so that inventory costs are posted to the general ledger every time you post an inventory transaction .
- Manually , so that inventory costs are only posted to the general ledger when you run a batch job .
# # To post inventory costs automatically
For each inventory transaction that you post , the appropriate values are posted to the inventory account , adjustment account , and COGS account in the general ledger .
Even if you use automatic cost posting , it is still necessary to periodically run the Adjust Cost - Item Entries batch job to ensure that the costs of goods are forwarded to the appropriate outbound transactions , such as sales or transfers . This is especially important in situations where you sell goods before invoicing the purchase of those goods .
If an error occurs in the dimension setup while posting the inventory cost to the general ledger , the posting will end with an error .

title : How to Undo Assembly Posting
# How to : Undo Assembly Posting
Sometimes you may need to undo a posted assembly order , for example when the order was posted with mistakes that must be corrected , or because it should not have been posted in the first place and must be rolled back .
To recreate or restore assembly orders , the following conditions must apply to the assembly item that was output in the original posting :
- It must still be in inventory , that is , it is not sold or otherwise consumed by outbound transactions .
- It must not be reserved .
- It must exist in the bin that it was output to .
In addition , existing assembly orders can only be restored if the number of lines and the sequence of lines on the original assembly order are not changed .
&gt; To solve conflicts due to line changes , you can manually revert the changes on the lines in question before undoing the related posted assembly order . Alternatively , you can post the assembly order fully and then select to recreate it when undoing the posting .
# # To undo posting of an assembly order

title : About Cost Accounting
Cost accounting can help you understand the costs of running a business . Cost accounting information is designed to analyze :
- What types of costs that you incur when you run a business ?
- Who bears the costs ?
In cost accounting , you allocate actual and budgeted costs of operations , departments , products , and projects to analyze the profitability of your company .
# # Workflow in Cost Accounting
Cost accounting has the following main components :
- Cost types , cost centers , and cost objects
- Cost entries and cost journals
The following diagram shows the workflow in cost accounting .
# # Cost Types , Cost Centers , and Cost Objects
You define cost types , cost centers , and cost objects to analyze what the costs are , where the costs come from , and who should bear the costs .
You define a chart of cost types with a structure and functionality that resembles the general ledger chart of accounts . You can transfer the general ledger income statement accounts or create your own chart of cost types .
Cost objects are products , product groups , or services of a company . These are the finished goods of a company that carry the costs .
You can link cost centers to departments and cost objects to projects in your company . However , you can link cost centers and cost objects to any dimensions in the general ledger and supplement them with subtotals and titles .

Operational costs can be transferred from the general ledger . You can automatically transfer the cost entries from the general ledger to cost entries with each posting . You can also use a batch job to transfer the general ledger entries to cost entries based on daily or monthly summary posting .
The allocation base that is used and the accuracy of the allocation definition have an influence on the results of cost allocations . The allocation definition is used to allocate costs first from so-called pre-cost centers to main cost centers and then from cost centers to cost objects .
You can create as many cost budgets as you want . You can copy the cost budget to the general ledger budget and vice versa . You can transfer budgeted costs as actual costs .

title : Date Calculation for Sales
If the customer has requested a specific delivery date , then the date on which the items must be available to pick to meet that delivery date is calculated .
If the customer does not request a specific delivery date , then the date on which the items can be delivered is calculated , starting from the date on which the items are available for picking .
# # Calculating a Requested Delivery Date
If you specify a requested delivery date on the sales order line , then that date is used as the starting point for the following calculations .
If the items are available to pick on the shipment date , then the sales process can continue .
If the items are not available to be picked on the shipment date , then a stock-out warning is displayed .
# # Calculating the Earliest Possible Delivery Date
If you do not specify a requested delivery date on the sales order line , or if the requested delivery date cannot be met , then the earliest date on which that the items are available is calculated . That date is then entered in the Shipment Date field on the line , and the date on which you plan to ship the items as well as the date on which they will be delivered to the customer are calculated using the following formulas .
title : Design Details - Transfers in Planning
# Design Details : Transfers in Planning
A transfer order looks much like any other order in the program . However , behind the scene it is very different .
This means that when the system manipulates the supply side of the transfer , it must make a similar change on the demand side .
# # Transfers are Dependent Demand
The related demand and supply has some resemblance with components of a production order line , but the difference is that components will be on the next planning level and with a different item , whereas the two parts of the transfer is situated on the same level , for the same item .
An important similarity is that just as components are dependent demand , so is the transfer demand . The demand from a transfer line is dictated by the supply side of the transfer in the sense that if the supply is changed , the demand is directly affected .
Unless the planning flexibility is None , a transfer line should never be treated as independent demand in planning .
In the planning procedure , the transfer demand should only be taken into account after the supply side has been processed by the planning system . Before this , the actual demand is not known . The sequence of the changes made is therefore very important when it comes to transfer orders .
The following illustration shows what a string of transfers could look like .
In this example , a customer orders the item at location GREEN . Location GREEN is supplied through transfer from the central warehouse RED . The central warehouse RED is supplied by transfer from production on location BLUE .
In this example , the planning system will start at the customer demand and work its way backwards through the chain . The demands and supplies will be processed one location at a time .
# # Transfer Level Code
The sequence in which the locations are processed in the planning system is determined by the transfer level code of the SKU .
The transfer level code is an internal field which is automatically calculated and stored on the SKU when SKU is created or modified . The calculation runs across all SKUs for a given combination of Item / Variant and uses the location code and the transfer-from code to determine the route the planning will have to use when traversing through the SKUs to ensure that all demands are processed .
When updating a SKU , the planning system will detect if SKUs with replenishment system Transfer are set up with circular references .
# # Planning Transfers without SKU
To support manual transfers , the planning will analyze existing transfer orders and then plan the order in which the locations should be processed . Internally , the planning system will operate with temporary SKUs carrying transfer level codes .
If more transfers to a given location exist , the first transfer order will define the planning direction . Transfers running in the opposite direction will be canceled .
# # Changing Quantity with Reservations
When changing quantities on existing supply , the planning system takes reservations into account in the sense that the reserved quantity represents the lower limit for how much the supply can be reduced .
# # Changing Quantity in a Transfer Chain
Now the planner at PINK location chooses to reserve against the purchase .
When the planning system runs again , it should get rid of excess supply . However , the reservation will lock the purchase and the transfer to a quantity of 27 .
When calculating the due date of a transfer order different kinds of lead time will be taken into account .
The lead times that are active when planning a transfer order are :
* Outbound Warehouse Handling Time
* Inbound Warehouse Handling Time
* On the planning line , the following fields are used to provide information about the calculation .
The shipment date of the transfer line will be shown in the Transfer Shipment Date field , and the receipt date of the transfer line will be shown in the Due Date field .
The starting and ending dates will be used to describe the actual transportation period .
The following illustration shows the interpretation of the starting date-time and ending date-time on planning lines related to transfer orders .
In this example , it means that :
* Shipment date + Outbound handling = Starting Date
* Starting Date + Shipping time = Ending Date
* Ending Date + Inbound Handling = Receipt Date
# # Safety Lead Time
The Default Safety Lead Time field in the Manufacturing Setup window and the related Safety Lead Time field on the item card will not be taken into account in the calculation of a transfer order . However , the safety lead time will still influence the total plan like it will affect the replenishment order ( purchase or production ) in the beginning of the transfer chain when the items are put on the location from which they will be transferred .
On the production order line , the Ending Date + Safety Lead Time + Inbound Warehouse Handling Time = Due Date .
On the purchase order line , the Planned Receipt Date + Safety Lead Time + Inbound Warehouse Handling Time = Expected Receipt Date .
# # Serial / Lot Numbers in Transfer Chains
If demand is changed from 27 to 22 , the system will lower the quantity down through the chain , with the binding reservation also being reduced .
title : Walkthrough - Planning Supplies Automatically

# Using Dynamics NAV without Outlook
There are eight methods of depreciation available :
* DB1 / SL
* DB2 / SL
&gt; When you use this method , a fixed asset is depreciated by the same amount each year .
When you use the straight-line method , you must specify one of the following options in the fixed asset depreciation book :
* The depreciation period ( years or months ) or a depreciation ending date
* A fixed yearly percentage
* A fixed yearly amount
Remaining depreciation days are calculated as the number of depreciation days minus the number of days between the depreciation starting date and the last fixed asset entry date .
# # # Fixed Yearly Percentage
# # # Fixed Yearly Amount
If you enter a fixed yearly amount , the program uses this formula to calculate the depreciation amount :
# # # Example - Straight-Line Depreciation
For this example , the fixed asset ledger entry looks like this :
* Depreciation starting date
This accelerated depreciation method allocates the largest portion of the cost of an asset to the early years of its useful lifetime . If you use this method , you must enter a fixed yearly percentage .
The following formula calculates depreciation amounts :
The depreciable basis is calculated as the book value less posted depreciation since the starting date of the current fiscal year .
# # # Example - Declining-Balance 1 Depreciation
The following table shows how the fixed asset ledger entries look .
The calculation continues until the book value equals the final rounding amount or the salvage value that you entered .
# # # Example - Declining-Balance 2 Depreciation
* ND = Number of depreciation days
* DBP = Declining-balance percent
The formula for calculating the depreciation amounts is :
The depreciation values are :
DB1 / SL is an abbreviated combination of Declining-Balance 1 and Straight-Line . The calculation continues until the book value equals the final rounding amount , or the salvage value that you entered .
You can use various percentages to calculate declining-balance .
The fixed asset ledger entries look like this :
The declining-balance amount is used because it is the greater amount .
The straight-line amount is used because it is the greater amount .
The program has a facility that allows you to set up user-defined depreciation methods .
# # # Depreciation Based on Number of Units
# # # To set up user-defined depreciation methods
# # # Example - User-defined Depreciation
You use a depreciation method that allows you to depreciate assets in an accelerated manner for income tax purposes .
You would use the following depreciation rates for a fixed asset with a three-year lifetime for tax purposes :
The acquisition cost is LCY 100,000 , and the depreciable lifetime is five years . Depreciation is calculated annually .
# # Half-Year Convention Depreciation
This depreciation method can be used in conjunction with the following depreciation methods in the program :
# # # Example - Half-Year Convention Depreciation
# # Example - DB1 / SL Depreciation Using Half-Year Convention
* Straight-line amount = 28,800 / 1.5 = 11,520.00 *
# # Duplicating Entries to More Depreciation Books
&gt; You cannot duplicate in the same journal and journal batch as you are duplicating from . If you post entries in the fixed asset G / L journal , you can duplicate them in the fixed asset journal or in the fixed asset G / L journal using another batch .

# How to : Work with Intercompany Documents and Journals
You use intercompany documents or journals to post transactions with your intercompany partners . When you post an intercompany document or journal line in your company , a corresponding document or journal line is created in your intercompany outbox that you can transfer to your partner . Your partner can then post the corresponding transaction in their company , without having to re-enter the data .
For sales and purchase documents , the intercompany partner code on the involved customer or vendor ensures that all orders and invoices generated pertaining to transactions with these companies will produce corresponding documents in the partner company , resulting in correct balancing of the accounts .
# # To fill in and send an intercompany sales order
You can send sales and purchase orders and return orders before posting . Invoices and credit memos cannot be sent until they are posted .

# How to : Run Full Planning , MPS or MRP
Proper planning results depend on the set up done on item cards , assembly BOMs , production BOMs , and routings .
# # Methods for Generating a Plan
&gt; The Calculate Regenerative Plan function is the most common process . The Calculate Plan and Carry out Action Messages functions , however , can be used to run the Calculate Net Change Plan process .
&gt; The Get Action Messages Plan function can be run between regenerative and net change planning runs to obtain an immediate view of the effect of schedule changes , but it is not intended as a replacement of full regenerative or net change planning processes .
# # To calculate the planning worksheet
# # To perform action messages
The batch job deletes the lines in the planning worksheet after it has performed the action message . The other lines remain in the planning worksheet until they are either accepted at a later date or else deleted . You can also delete the lines manually .
Action messages are issued by the order tracking system when balance is unattainable in the existing order network . They can be viewed as a suggestion for you to process changes that reestablish equilibrium between supply and demand .
To avoid small , superfluous , or unimportant action messages , the user can establish dampeners , which serve to restrict the generation of action messages to only those changes that exceed the defined quantity or number of days .
In response to any supply / demand imbalances , the following action messages are generated .
title : Design Details - Planning Parameters
# Design Details : Planning Parameters
The way in which the planning system controls item supply is determined by various settings on the item card or SKU , and settings in manufacturing setup . The following table shows how these parameters are used for planning .
&#124; Define if the item is to be planned &#124; Reordering Policy = Blank &#124;
# # Define How Much to Reorder
If the planning system detects the need to reorder , the selected reordering policy is used to determine when and how much to order .
Independent of the reordering policy , the planning system usually follows this logic :
The following reordering policies affect the quantity that is being reordered .
# # Optimize When and How Much to Reorder
The timing of rescheduling period , dampener period , and lot accumulation period is based on a supply date . The time bucket is based on the planning start date , as shown in the following illustration .
# # Modify the Supply Orders
When the quantity of the order proposal has been calculated , one or more of the order modifiers can adjust it . For example , the maximum order quantity is larger than or equal to the minimum order quantity , which is larger than or equal to the order multiple .
The quantity is decreased if it exceeds the maximum order quantity . Then , it is increased if it is below the minimum order quantity . Finally , it is rounded up so that it matches a specified order multiple . Any remaining quantity uses the same adjustments until the total demand has been converted into order proposals .
The * * Manufacturing Policy * * option defines which additional orders the MRP calculation will propose .

title : Walkthrough - Setting Up and Invoicing Sales Prepayments
# Walkthrough : Setting Up and Invoicing Sales Prepayments
This walkthrough will take you through the following scenarios :
- Setting up prepayments
- Creating an order that requires a prepayment
- Correcting the prepayment requirements on an order
- Applying prepayments to an order
- Invoicing the final amount on an order with prepayment
- Accounts Receivable Administrator ( Arnie )
Arnie works in the Accounts Receivable department , where he posts invoices and payments .
In this scenario , Phyllis sets up prepayment requirements for the customer Selangorian , based on their credit history , and gives Susan instructions for how to handle their orders .
When the customer calls , Susan negotiates with the customer until they reach an agreement . She can then choose to calculate the prepayment in several different ways .
After Susan sends the prepayment invoice , the customer orders an extra item . Susan updates the order and creates a second prepayment invoice .
Arnie registers the customer &apos;s payment and applies it to the invoices , and then sends the final invoice .
Phyllis sets up the system to handle prepayments for customers .
- Phyllis decides to have the same number series for prepayments as the one used for sales invoicing .
- Phyllis sets the program to check if prepayments are required before final invoicing on an order .
- Phyllis sets up default values for a required prepayment percentage for particular items and customers .
The following procedures describe how to complete Phyllis &apos; tasks :
# # # # To set up number series for prepayments
# # # # To block shipments for unpaid prepayment
Now you cannot ship or invoice an order that has an unpaid prepayment amount .
# # # # To assign default prepayment percentages to customers and items
9 . Close all windows .
# # Creating an Order that Requires a Prepayment
Susan creates the prepayment invoice and sends it to the customer .
5 . Accept the overdue balance warning that is displayed .
6 . Fill in two sales lines with the following information .
By default , the prepayment fields on the sales line are hidden , so you must display them .
In this scenario , Susan has been instructed to suggest a total prepayment of 2000 for the order .
The recalculation includes all lines that have a prepayment percentage that is greater than 0 .
Now the customer asks if the prepayment percent can be set to 35 % . Susan &apos;s supervisor approves the change .
14 . Verify that the lines have been updated accordingly .
# # Creating a Prepayment Invoice
After entering the correct prepayment values on the order , Susan creates the prepayment invoice and sends it to the customer .
# # Creating an Additional Prepayment Invoice
# # # # To create an additional prepayment invoice
The customer pays the prepayments amount and Arnie , who works in the accounts department , registers the payment and applies it to the prepayment invoices .
2 . Fill in a journal line with the following information .
5 . Repeat the previous step for the second prepayment .
The amount field has now been filled in with the sum of the two prepayment invoices .
# # Invoicing the Remaining Amount
Now Arnie has been informed that the items on the order have been shipped and that the order is ready for invoicing . Arnie creates the invoice for the order .
1 . Open the sales order .
&gt; Normally , the shipping department would have already posted the shipment .
Arnie can view the history to verify that the sales invoice was created as intended .
You have also posted a prepayment invoice , created a second prepayment invoice when the order has changed , and posted the final invoice for the remaining amount .
title : Design Details - Item Tracking and Reservations
# Design Details : Item Tracking and Reservations
The concept of Late Binding ensures that a nonspecific reservation of a serial number or a lot number remains loosely coupled until posting . At posting time , the reservation system can reshuffle nonspecific reservations to ensure that fixed application is possible against the serial or lot number that is actually picked . Meanwhile , the serial or lot number is made available for specific reservation in other documents that request that particular serial or lot number .
A nonspecific reservation is one in which the user does not care which specific item is picked , and a specific reservation is one in which the user does care .
&gt; The Late Binding functionality relates only to items that are set up with specific item tracking , and it applies only to reservations against inventory , not against inbound supply orders .
Reservation of item tracking numbers falls into two categories , as shown in the following table .
The main difference between specific and nonspecific reservation is defined by the existence of serial or lot numbers on the demand side , as shown in the following table .
&gt; On a nonspecific reservation the lot number or serial number field is blank in the reservation entry that points at the demand , such as the sale .
When a user posts an outbound document after picking the wrong serial or lot number , other nonspecific reservations are reshuffled to reflect the actual serial or lot number that is picked . This satisfies the posting engine with a fixed application between supply and demand .
For all supported business scenarios , reshuffling is possible only against positive item ledger entries that carry reservation and serial or lot numbers but without defined serial or lot numbers on the demand side .
The Late Binding functionality supports the following business scenarios :
* Entering a specific serial or lot number on an outbound document with nonspecific reservation of a wrong serial or lot number .
* Reserving a specific serial or lot number .
* Posting an outbound document with nonspecific reservation of a serial or lot number .
# # # Entering Serial or Lot Numbers on an Outbound Document with Wrong Nonspecific Reservation
# # # Reserve Specific Serial or Lot Numbers
# # # Posting an Outbound Document with Nonspecific Reservation of Serial or Lot Numbers
This business scenario is supported with Late Binding functionality that enables fixed application and outbound posting of what is actually picked by reshuffling another nonspecific reservation of a serial or lot number . If reshuffling is not possible , then the following standard error message appears when the user tries to post the shipment :

2 . Open the vendor card for a vendor that will be eligible for invoice discounts .
&gt; Invoice discount codes are represented by existing vendor cards . This enables you to quickly assign invoice discount terms to vendors by picking the name of another vendors who will have the same terms .
Proceed to set up new the purchase invoice discount terms .
# # To choose a principle for posting purchase discounts
# # Purchase Invoice Discounts and Service Charges
Before you can use invoice discounts with purchases , you must specify the vendors that offer you the discounts .
In addition to a discount percentage , you can link a service charge amount to a specific invoice amount .
You can define the terms of the invoice discount in LCY for domestic vendors and in foreign currency for foreign vendors .
&gt; The following describes how the best price is calculated for sales . The calculation is the same for purchases .
- Does the customer have a price / discount agreement , or does the customer belong to a group that does ?
- Is the item or the item discount group on the line included in any of these price / discount agreements ?
- Is there a minimum quantity requirement in the price / discount agreement that is fulfilled ?
If no special price can be calculated for the item on the line , then either the last direct cost or the unit price from the item card is inserted .

title : Work with Bills of Material to Manage Components
You use bills of materials ( BOMs ) to structure parent items that must be assembled or produced by resources or machine centers from components . An assembly BOM can also be used to sell a parent item as a kit consisting of its components .
# # Assembly BOMs or Production BOMs
Assembly BOMs are described in this topic .
Both assembly orders and production orders may be linked directly to sales orders . However , you can only use assembly orders to customize the end item directly for a customer request with the sales order .
# # To create an assembly BOM
To define a parent item that consists of other items , and potentially of resources required to put the parent together , you must create an assembly BOM .
Assembly BOMs usually contain items but can also contain one or more resources that are required to put the assembly item together .
There are two parts to creating an assembly BOM :
- Setting up a new item
- Defining the BOM structure of the assembly item .
Proceed to enter components or resources on the assembly BOM .
# # To view the components of an assembly item indented according to the BOM structure
# # To replace the assembly item with its components on document lines
From any sales and purchase document that contains an assembly item , you can use a special function to replace the line for the assembly item with new lines for its components . This function is useful , for example , if you want to sell the components as a kit that represents the assembly item .
The following procedure is based on a sales invoice . The same steps apply to other sales documents and to all purchase documents .
2 . Open a sales invoice that contains a line for an assembly item .
# # To calculate the standard cost of an assembly item
You calculate the unit cost of an assembly item by rolling up the unit cost of each component and resource in the item ’ s assembly BOM .
The unit cost of an assembly BOM always equals the total of the unit costs of its components , including other assembly BOMs , and any resources .

# Design Details : Maximum Qty .
The Maximum Quantity policy is a way to maintain inventory using a reorder point .
Everything regarding the Fixed Reorder Qty. policy also applies to this policy . The only difference is the quantity of the suggested supply . When using the maximum quantity policy , the reorder quantity will be defined dynamically based on the projected inventory level and will therefore usually differ from order to order .
# # Calculated per Time Bucket
The system will ensure that the projected inventory at least reaches the reorder point level – in case the user has forgotten to specify a maximum inventory quantity .
# # Combines with Order Modifiers
Depending on the setup , it may be best to combine the Maximum Quantity policy with order modifiers to ensure a minimum order quantity or round it to an integer number of purchase units of measure , or split it into more lots as defined by the maximum order quantity .
title : How to Cross-Dock Items
# How to : Cross-Dock Items
Cross-docking functionality is available to you if you have set up your location to require warehouse receive and put-away processing .
If you have calculated cross-dock quantities , put-away lines to the cross-dock bin for cross-dock calculations are created when you post the receipt . Other put-away lines are created as usual .
The program does not keep separate records about items that have been cross-docked , but registers them as ordinary put-away instructions .
1 . Set up at least one cross-dock bin , if you are using bins . Set up a cross-dock zone , if you are using directed put-away and pick .
&gt; Cross-docking is only possible if your location is set up to require warehouse receive and put-away processing .
# # To cross-dock items without viewing the opportunities
If you have bins , the cross-docked items have been assigned to the default cross-dock bin defined on the location card .
# # To cross-dock items after viewing the opportunities
You want to view the source document lines that are requesting the item before you post the receipt .
&gt; In the warehouse put-away , you can continue to change the quantities that are being put away in storage or cross-docked , as necessary . For example , you might decide to cross-dock an extra quantity to expedite the cross-dock registration .
# # To view cross-docked items in a shipment or pick worksheet
If you are not using bins , you must remember to check the cross-dock area from time to time , or rely on notifications from receipts that items for production have arrived .
title : Process Incoming and Outgoing IC Transactions
# How to : Manage the Intercompany Inbox and Outbox
All of the intercompany transactions that you receive electronically from your intercompany partners are listed in the intercompany Inbox .
What you can do with a transaction depends whether it was :
- Created by your intercompany partner
- Rejected by your intercompany partner and returned to you
# # # # Created by Intercompany Partner
When you receive a new transaction that was created by your partner , you can choose to either :
- Accept the transaction
- Reject the transaction ( Return to partner )
# # # # Returned from Intercompany Partner
If the transaction was rejected by your intercompany partner , your only choice is to cancel the transaction in the inbox . Then you must create correction lines or reverse the journal or document in your company .
If you accepted a transaction in your inbox but then deleted the document or journal instead of posting it , you can re-create the inbox entry and accept it again .
# # Getting an Overview of Intercompany Transactions for a Period
# # To import intercompany transactions from a file
The transactions are imported into the inbox and you can now process them .
# # To process incoming intercompany transactions
When your intercompany partners send you intercompany transactions , the transactions end up in your intercompany inbox . You must evaluate each transaction in your inbox and act upon it .
# # To process outgoing intercompany transactions
When you post an intercompany journal or document , or send an intercompany order confirmation , the transactions are sent to your intercompany outbox . In order for them to be sent on to your intercompany partners , you must open the outbox and process them .
Lines that you processed with the * * Return to Inbox * * action will be moved to the inbox where you can then accept them to create documents or journal lines in your company .
Occasionally , you may want to re-create a transaction in the inbox or outbox . For example , if you accepted a transaction in your inbox but then deleted the document or journal instead of posting it , you can re-create the inbox entry and accept it again .

title : Apply Payments to Unpaid Sales Documents
# How to : Reconcile Customer Payments Manually From a List of Unpaid Sales Documents
# # To set up the payment registration journal
# # To reconcile payments individually
5 . Repeat steps 2-4 for other lines that represent posted documents for which payments are made .
Payments entries are posted to general ledger , bank , and customer accounts . Each payment is applied to the related posted sales document .
# # To reconcile lump payments
&gt; This date must be the same on all lines that will be posted as a lump payment .
# # To process customer payments with discounts manually
If you have agreed on a payment discount with your customer , then the payment amounts can be lower than the invoice amounts if payment occurs before the agreed discount date .
The following procedures explains four different ways to post discounted payments in the * * Payment Registration * * window .
* The payment amount is equal to the remaining discounted amount , and the payment date is before the discount date . You post the payment as is .
* The payment amount is lower than the remaining discounted amount . You post the payment as partial . The document remains open to collect / pay the remaining amount .
* The payment amount is more than the remaining discounted amount . You post the payments as is . Only the remaining amount is posted . The additional amount is credited to the customer .
# # # To process a payment amount that is equal to the discounted amount but where the payment date is after the discount date
&gt; If you want to make an exception and grant the discount even though the payment is late , follow these steps :
The error message and the red font disappear , and you can proceed to process the discounted payment .
The related document remains open .
# # # To process a payment that is lower than the remaining discounted amount
# # # To process a payment that is more than the remaining discounted amount
The related document is closed , and the customer is credited the excess payment amount .
# # To find a specific sales document that is not fully invoiced
* Amount or amount range
The following procedure explains how to find a specific document by using both search criteria .
&gt; The value that you enter in this field is enclosed in hidden wildcard characters . This means that the function searches for all document numbers that contain the entered value .
The Search function searches among documents that are not fully invoiced based on the specified criteria .
# # To record or post a payment without a related document
Proceed to record an undocumented payment .
You can either post the journal line to update the total on the balancing account . Alternatively , you can leave the journal line unposted , and perhaps append it with a note that the payment needs more analysis .
title : How to Allocate Resources
# How to : Allocate Resources
# # To see an overview of service orders and service quotes
You may often need to see the list of service orders or service quotes that meet certain requirements to be able to perform specific actions with them one by one . For example , you may need to allocate resources to service orders that belong to a specific customer .
3 . Choose the entry with the service task to which you want to allocate a resource .
7 . Specify a date on which the resource has enough available hours for the task , and which is close to the response date of the service order .
Repeat these steps for each date that you want to allocate the resource to the service task .
# # To allocate a resource using a service order
3 . Choose the service item line corresponding to the service task you want to allocate a resource to .
&gt; For a service item in a service order , there can only be active allocation entries with one resource or resource group at a time .
# # To reallocate resources on a service order
You can reallocate resources directly from a service order or service quote when you are working with it . The original entry will still exist , but its status is updated as follows :
2 . Open the relevant service order .
# # To reallocate a resource using the dispatch board
4 . Select the allocation entry with the service task you want to reallocate a resource to .
&gt; The old entry still exists but the status is updated in the following ways :
# # To register resource hours
If the same resource works on all the service items in the service order , you can register the total resource hours for one service item only and then split the resource line to assign the resource hours to the other service items .
# # To assign a resource to all service items in an order
The following procedure shows how to split resource lines in the * * Service Invoice Lines * * window .
Resource lines for the other service items in the order are created with the same resource number as the line you split . The quantity is the quantity for the line you split divided by the number of service items in the order .
You can cancel resource allocations for service tasks without reallocating the tasks .
3 . Choose the allocation entry with the service task that you want to cancel allocation for .

title : How to Work with Responsibility Centers
Using multiple locations together with responsibility centers provides the ability to manage business operations in the most flexible , yet optimal way .
# # To set up a responsibility center
If you are using responsibility centers to administer your company , it can be useful to have a default responsibility center for your company .
&gt; When you enter a responsibility center code on a document , it affects the address , dimensions , and prices on the document .
# # To assign responsibility centers to users
You can set up users so that in their daily routines the program retrieves only the documents relevant for their particular work areas . Users are usually associated with one responsibility center and work only with documents related to specific application areas at that particular center .
To set this up , you assign responsibility centers to users in three functional areas : Purchases , Sales , and Service Management .
&gt; Users will still be able to view all posted documents and ledger entries , not just those related to their own responsibility center .
title : Create a Sales Order Linked to a Purchase Order for a Direct Shipment
# How to : Make Drop Shipments
A drop shipment is the shipment of items from one of your vendors directly to one of your customers .
# # To create a sales order for drop shipment
To prepare a drop shipment , you create a sales order for an item as normal , except you must indicate on the sales line that the sale requires drop shipment .
# # To create the purchase order for drop shipment
To prepare a drop shipment for the item to be sold , you create a purchase order as normal , except you must indicate on the purchase order that it must be shipped to your customer , not to yourself .
The line information from the sales order is inserted on the purchase order line ( s ) .
You can now instruct the vendor to ship the items to your customer , for example , by mailing the purchase order as a PDF .
# # To view the linked purchase order from the sales order
# # To post a drop shipment

If you do not specify a requested receipt date , then the order date on the line is used as the starting point for calculating the date on which you can expect to receive the items and the date on which the items are available for picking .
# # Calculating with a Requested Receipt Date
If there is a requested receipt date on the purchase order line , then that date is used as the starting point for the following calculations .
- requested receipt date - lead time calculation = order date
- requested receipt date + inbound whse. handling time + safety lead time = expected receipt date
If you entered a requested receipt date on the purchase order header , then that date is copied to the corresponding field on all the lines . You can change this date on any of the lines , or you can remove the date on the line .
- order date + lead time calculation = planned receipt date
- planned receipt date + inbound whse. handling time + safety lead time = expected receipt date
If you change the order date on the line , such as when items are not available at your vendor until a later date , then the relevant dates on the line are automatically recalculated .

title : Design Details - Assembly Order Posting
# Design Details : Assembly Order Posting
The following journal postings occur during assembly order posting :
- The item journal posts positive item ledger entries , representing output of the assembly item , from the assembly order header
- The item journal posts negative item ledger entries , representing consumption of assembly components , from the assembly order lines .
- The resource journal posts usage of assembly resources ( time units ) , from the assembly order lines .
- The capacity journal posts value entries relating to the resource usage , from the assembly order lines .
The following diagram shows the structure of item and resource ledger entries that result from assembly order posting .
&gt; Machine and work centers are included to illustrate that capacity ledger entries are created from both production and assembly .
The following diagram shows how assembly data flows into ledger entries during posting :
The posting of an assembly order occurs in the following order :
1 . The assembly order lines are posted .
2 . The assembly order header is posted .
The following table outlines the sequence of actions .
&gt; Unlike for production output , which is posted at expected cost , assembly output is posted at actual cost .
# # # Detecting the Adjustment
- Cost adjustment is detected by marking the order whenever a material / resource is posted as consumed / used .
- Cost is forwarding by applying the costs from material / resource to the output entries associated with the same order .
The following graphic shows the adjustment entry structure and how assembly costs are adjusted .
# # # Performing the Adjustment
This is enabled by the following data structure .
In addition , posting group fields on the assembly order header and assembly order lines are populated by default as follows .
&#124; Assembly Order Header &#124; Item &#124; Inventory Posting Group &#124; Gen. Prod . Posting Group &#124;
&#124; Assembly Order Line &#124; Item &#124; Inventory Posting Group &#124; Gen. Prod . Posting Group &#124;
&#124; Assembly Order Line &#124; Resource &#124; &#124; Gen. Prod . Posting Group &#124;
The item ledger entry that results from posting an assemble-to-order sale is fixed applied to the related item ledger entry for the assembly output . Accordingly , the cost of an assemble-to-order sale is derived from the assembly order that it was linked to .
Posting sales order lines where a part is inventory quantity and another part is assemble-to-order quantity results in separate item ledger entries , one for the inventory quantity and one for the assemble-to-order quantity .

# Design Details : Warehouse Setup
The following warehouse-related granules exist :
- Internal Picks and Put-aways ( 4630 )
# # Bin and Bin Content
A bin content can be given a property of Fixed , Dedicated , or Default to define how the bin content can be used . Bins with none of these properties are referred to as floating bins .
A fixed bin holds items that are assigned to the bin code in question . The Fixed bin property ensures that even if the bin content is momentarily emptied , the bin content does not disappear , and the bin is therefore selected again as soon as it has been replenished .
&gt; If the outbound items are placed in several bins , then items are first taken from the non-default bins , to empty that bin content , and then the remaining items are taken from the default bin .
There can only be one default bin per item per location .
In WMS installations , you can restrict the warehouse activities that are allowed for a bin by assigning a bin type to it . The following bin types exist :
&#124; RECEIVE &#124; Items posted as received but not yet put away . &#124;
&#124; SHIP &#124; Items picked for warehouse shipment lines but not yet posted as shipped . &#124;
&gt; Only movement can be made to bins of type RECEIVE and QC . Similarly , only movements can be made from bins of type SHIP and QC .
In advanced warehousing , you can automate and optimize how items are collected in put-away and pick worksheets by ranking bins so that items are suggested taken or placed according to rank criteria to use warehouse space optimally .
Put-away processes are optimized according to bin ranking by suggesting higher-ranking bins before lower-ranking bins . Similarly , pick processes are optimized by first suggesting items from bin content with high bin ranking . Furthermore , bin replenishments are suggested from lower-ranking bins to higher-ranking bins .
Bin ranking together with bin content information are the basic properties that allow users to slot items in the warehouse .
In advanced warehousing , bins can be set up with capacity values , such as quantity , total cubage , and weight to control which and how items are stored in the bin .
Before you set capacity restrictions for bin contents on a bin , you must first make sure that the UOM and dimensions of the item have been set up on the item card .
&gt; It is only possible to operate with multiple UOMs in WMS installations . I all other configurations , bin contents can only be in the base UOM . In all transactions with a UOM higher than the item ’ s base UOM , the quantity is converted to the base UOM .
In advanced warehousing , bins can be grouped in zones to manage how the workflow of warehouse activities is directed .
Most properties assigned to a zone will by default be assigned to the bin that is created from that zone .
When you work with warehouse classes and a default receiving / shipping bin , you must manually fill in the appropriate bins in the warehouse receipt and shipment lines .
In inbound flows , the class code is only highlighted on inbound lines where the item class code does not match the default receiving bin . If the correct default bins are not assigned , then the quantity cannot be received .

To minimize database access when handling production orders , the planning line can be maintained in three levels , while aiming to perform the least demanding maintenance level :
* Create only the planning line with the current due date and quantity but without the routing and components .
* Include BOM explosion : this can wait until just before the supply event is closed .
This concludes the descriptions of how demand and supply is loaded , prioritized , and balanced by the planning system . In integration with this supply planning activity , the system must ensure that the required inventory level of each planned item is maintained according to its reordering policies .
title : Overview of Tasks to Deliver Service
title : Count , Adjust , and Reclassify Inventory
# How to : Count , Adjust , and Reclassify Inventory
# # To perform a physical inventory
Apart from the physical counting task , the complete process involves the following three tasks :
- Calculate the expected inventory .
- Print the report to be used when counting .
# # # To calculate the expected inventory in basic warehouse configurations
# # # To calculate the expected inventory in advanced warehouse configurations
3 . Fill in the batch job request window with the numbers of the items you want to count and with your location .
If you do not do this before you perform the warehouse physical inventory , the results you post to the physical inventory journal and item ledger in the second part of the process will be the physical inventory results combined with other warehouse adjustments for the items that were counted .
The program creates a line for each bin that fulfills the filter requirements . You can at this point still delete some of the lines , but if you want to post the results as a physical inventory , you must count the item in all the bins that contain it .
9 . Open the report request page and print the lists on which you want employees to record the quantity of items that they count in each bin .
When you register the journal , the program creates two warehouse entries in the warehouse register for every line that was counted and registered :
# # # To print the report to be used when counting
Employees can now proceed to count inventory and record any discrepancies on the printed report .
# # # To enter and post the actual counted inventory in basic warehouse configurations
The related fields are updated accordingly .
Both item ledger entries and physical inventory ledger entries are created . Open the item card to view the resulting physical inventory ledger entries .
# # # To enter and post the actual counted inventory in advanced warehouse configurations
4 . Post the journal without changing any quantities .
# # To perform cycle counting
# # # To set up counting periods
# # # To assign a counting period to an item
2 . Select the item to which you want to assign a counting period .
# # # To initiate a count based on counting periods in basic warehouse configurations
# # # To initiate a count based on counting periods in advanced warehouse configurations
# # To adjust the inventory of one item
# # # To adjust the inventory quantity of multiple items in basic warehouse configurations
# # # To adjust bin quantities in advanced warehouse configurations
2 . Fill in the header information .
4 . Enter the bin in which you are putting the extra items or where you have found items to be missing .
# # To synchronize the adjusted warehouse entries with the related item ledger entries
At appropriate intervals as defined by company policy , you must post the warehouse adjustment bin records in the item ledger . Some companies find it appropriate to post adjustments to the item ledger every day , while others may find it adequate to reconcile less frequently .
2 . Fill in the fields on each journal line .
6 . Post the journal lines to enter the quantity differences in the item ledger . The inventory in the warehouse bins now corresponds precisely to the inventory in the item ledger .
# # To reclassify an item &apos;s lot number
The program creates an order-to-order link , which acts as a preliminary connection between the supply , a supply order or inventory , and the demand that it is going to fulfill .
Apart from using the Order policy , the order-to-order link can be applied during planning in the following ways :
* When using the Make-to-Order manufacturing policy to create multi-level or project type production orders ( producing needed components on the same production order ) .
* When using the Sales Order Planning feature to create a production order from a sales order .

title : How to Create Routings
# How to : Create Routings
Manufacturing companies use routings to visualize and direct the manufacturing process .
The routing is the basis of process scheduling , capacity scheduling , scheduled assignment of material needs , and manufacturing documents .
Proceed to fill in the routing lines .
&gt; Setup time is calculated per production order , whereas run time is calculated per produced item .
12 . Continue to fill in lines for all operations involved in producing the item in question .
# # To create routing links
Another important benefit is that linked components and operations are displayed in a logical process structure when you use the * * Production Journal * * window for output and consumption posting .
2 . Open the routing that contains the operations that you want to link .
4 . Proceed to add different routing link codes to other operations in the routing , if relevant .
&gt; You should not use the same routing link code in different operations on a routing because you may incorrectly link a component to two different operations , so that it is consumed two times .
&gt; It is a good idea to name the routing link code after the operation in order to ensure operation-specific routing links .
Routing link codes are now assigned to operations . Next , you must create the actual link by assigning the same codes to specific components in the relevant production BOM .
# # To assign personnel , tools , and quality measures to routing operations .
# # To create a new versions of a routing
The version principle enables you to manage several versions of a routing . The structure of the routing version corresponds to the structure of the routing consisting of the routing version header and the routing version lines . The basic difference is defined by the starting date .

title : Planning With or Without Locations
Concerning planning with or without location codes on demand lines , the planning system operates in a straight forward way when :
- demand lines always carry location codes and the system fully uses stockkeeping units , including the relevant location setup .
- demand lines never carry location codes and the system does not use SKUs or any location setup ( see last scenario below ) .
However , if demand lines sometimes have location codes and other times do not , the planning system will follow certain rules depending on setup .
When the planning system detects demand at a location ( a line with a location code ) , it will behave in different ways depending on 3 critical setup values .
During a planning run , the system checks for the 3 setup values in sequence and plans accordingly :
If yes , then :
2 . Does SKU exist for the item ?
The item is planned according to planning parameters on the SKU card .
If no , then :
&gt; This minimal alternative only covers the exact demand . Any planning parameters defined are ignored .
See variations in the scenarios below .
# # Demand at &quot; Blank Location &quot;
See variations in the setup scenarios below .
# # # Setup 1 :
- SKU is set up for * RED *
- Component at Location = * BLUE *
The item is planned according to planning parameters on the SKU card ( including possible transfer ) .
The item is not planned because no location is defined on the demand line .
# # # Setup 2 :
- No SKU exists
# # # Setup 3 :
# # # Setup 4 :
- Component at Location = * BLANK *
Therefore , if you often plan for demand at locations , it is strongly advised to use the Stockkeeping Units feature .

# How to : Set Up Bin Types
You can direct the flow of items through bins that you have defined for particular warehouse activities . You give each bin its basic flow activities , and thereby define the way the way a bin is used , by assigning it a bin type .
# # To set up the bin types you want to use
3 . Select the activities that can be performed with each bin type .
&gt; Bin types are only applicable if you are using directed put-away and pick for your location .
The bin type determines only how a bin is used when processing the flow of items through the warehouse . You can always override the suggestions for any warehouse document , and you can move items in or out of any bin by performing a warehouse movement .
The bin types that you can create are listed below .
&#124; RECEIVE &#124; Items registered as posted receipts but not yet put away . &#124;

# Design Details : Planning Assignment Table
* Consumption of items other than planned .
* Output of items other than planned .
* Unplanned changes in inventory .
For these direct supply-demand displacements , the order tracking and action messaging system maintains the Planning Assignment table and states a planning reason as an action message .
The following changes in master data can also cause a planning imbalance :
* Deleted line ( child item ) .
* Changes in the following item card fields .
* Safety Stock Quantity or Safety Lead Time .
* Lead Time Calculation .
* Production BOM No . ( and all children of old BOM reference ) .

title : Design Details - Staying Under the Overflow Level
# Design Details : Staying under the Overflow Level
# # Calculating the Overflow Level
The overflow level is calculated in different ways depending on planning setup .
# # # Maximum Qty. reordering policy
# # # Fixed Reorder Qty. reordering policy
Overflow level = Reorder Quantity + Reorder Point
&gt; If the minimum order quantity is higher than the reorder point , then it will replace as follows : Overflow Level = Reorder Quantity + Minimum Order Quantity
If an order multiple exists , then it will adjust the overflow level for both Maximum Qty. and Fixed Reorder Qty. reordering policies .
# # Creating the Planning Line with Overflow Warning
# # # Calculating the Planning Line Quantity
Planning Line Quantity = Current Supply Quantity – ( Projected Inventory – Overflow Level )
&gt; As with all warning lines , any maximum / minimum order quantity or order multiple will be ignored .
# # # Defining the Action Message Type
- If the planning line quantity is higher than 0 , then the action message is Change Qty .
- If the planning line quantity is equal to or lower than 0 , then the action message is Cancel
# # # Composing the Warning Message
- The projected inventory level that triggered the warning
- The calculated overflow level
- The due date of the supply event .
Example : “ The projected inventory 120 is higher than the overflow level 60 on 28-01-11 ”
&#124; Reordering Policy &#124; Maximum Qty . &#124;
# # # Situation before sales decrease
&#124; Event &#124; Change Qty . &#124; Projected Inventory &#124;
&#124; Change &#124; Change Qty . &#124; Projected Inventory &#124;
# # # Resulting Planning Lines
&gt; Without the Overflow feature , no warning is created if the projected inventory level is above maximum inventory . This could cause a superfluous supply of 30 .
title : Design Details - Fixed Reorder Qty .
# Design Details : Fixed Reorder Qty .
If the planning system detects that the reorder point has been reached or crossed in a given time bucket ( reorder cycle ) – above or on the reorder point at the start of the period and below or on the reorder point at the end of the period – it will suggest to create a new supply order of the specified reorder quantity and forward schedule it from the first date after the end of the time bucket .
The bucketed reorder point concept reduces the number of supply suggestions . This reflects a manual process of frequently walking through the warehouse to check the actual contents in the various bins .
# # Creates only Necessary Supply
Before suggesting a new supply order to meet a reorder point , the planning system checks if supply has already been ordered to be received within the item ’ s lead time . If an existing supply order will solve the problem by bringing the projected inventory to or above the reorder point within the lead time , the system will not suggest a new supply order .
# # Should Not be Used with Forecast
Because the anticipated demand is already expressed in the reorder point level it is not necessary to include a forecast in the planning of an item using a reorder point . If it is relevant to base the plan on a forecast , use the lot-for-lot policy .
# # Must Not be Used with Reservations

title : Walkthrough - Tracing Serial-Lot Numbers
This walkthrough demonstrates how to identify which items are defective , which vendor supplied them , and where they are used so that those orders can be stopped or recalled .
- Tracing origin to usage .
- Searching for all current records which hold the traced serial / lot number .
- To create new items and several business transactions by following the &quot; Prepare Sample Data &quot; section , later in this walkthrough .
- Which lot of racing frames was faulty .
- On which purchase order the faulty lot was received .
You must create the following new items :
- 1002 , Racing Bike : serial number-specific tracking
Then you must create various purchase , production , and sales transactions with the two items .
# # # To create the items
4 . All other fields have acceptable default data or do not have to be filled in .
Next , define the item &apos;s manufacturing setup .
Next , purchase racing frames from Custom Metals Incorporated .
# # # To purchase components
Next , purchase racing frames from Coolwood Technologies .
Next , produce two racing bikes , SN1 and SN2 .
# # # To produce end items
3 . Create a new released production order by filling in the following fields .
Next , post consumption of racing frames from LOT1 .
Next , produce two more racing bikes , SN3 and SN4 .
Next , post more consumption of racing frames from LOT1 .
20 . Close the production journal and the production orders .
Next , sell racing bikes . First sell the racing bike with SN1 to Selangorian Ltd ..
# # # To sell the end items
Next , sell the racing bike with SN2 to The Cannon Group PLC .
Finally , sell some racing frames separately . The Cannon Group PLC. also orders four separate racing frames for their own assembly line .
&gt; Do not post the last sales order for five racing frames .
This completes the preparation of data to demonstrate the Item Tracing and Navigate features .
# # Tracing from Usage to Origin
# # # To determine which lot included the faulty frame and who supplied it
Note that one sales shipment header matches the search criteria . Before you continue the trace , verify that the shipment is the one that shipped the faulty racing bike to Selangorian Ltd .
Now continue to trace the origin of the sales shipment of the racing bike with number SN1 .
6 . Choose the + icon on the trace lines to gradually expand and trace backward in the chain of transactions that the sales shipment originates from .
You can trace the following transaction history :
- The first posted document backward in the chain of transactions is the output posting of SN1 from the first released production order .
- The next posted document backward after that is the consumption posting from the first released production order . Here the quality controller sees that a racing frame from LOT1 was used .
- The lowest posted document in this chain is the posted purchase receipt on which racing frames with LOT1 entered inventory .
The quality controller has now established which lot of racing frames was faulty and he can search for the last trace line to see which vendor supplied them , namely Custom Metals Incorporated .
&gt; Do not make any additional modifications to the trace result , as you will use it in the next section .
The quality controller has established that the faulty racing frames came from LOT1 . He must now find any other racing bikes that contain racing frames from the faulty lot so that those bikes can be stopped or recalled .
# # # To find all usage of the faulty lot
To obtain an overview of all usage of item 2000 with LOT1 , continue to expand all trace lines .
The quality controller immediately informs the sales department so that they can initiate a recall of the defective racing bike from the customer , Cannon Group PLC .
# # Finding All Records of a Serial / Lot Number
# # # To find all occurrences of LOT1 in non-posted records , such as open orders
Here the quality controller sees one open sales line for the faulty racing frames . He immediately suggests to the sales department that this order be canceled and a new production order , based on good racing frames , be initiated .

2 . Choose the contract or contract quote .
# # Distributing Differences Between New and Calculated Annual Amounts
If you change the annual amount of a service contract or contract quote , you may want to distribute the difference between its new and calculated ammual amounts on the contract lines . There are three ways to distribute amounts :
* Even distribution
* Distribution based on line amounts
If you change the annual amount of the service contract or contract quote , you may want to distribute the difference between its new and calculated annual amounts on the contract lines . Even distribution is one of the automatic distribution methods that can help you spread equally the new and calculated annual amounts difference between line amounts on the contract lines . The following list of distribution procedure steps describe the main idea of this method :
* Line Discount Amount = Line Value - Line Amount .
* Profit = Line Amount - Line Cost .
The steps are repeated for each contract line .
The * * Allow Unbalanced Amounts * * check box is not selected in the service contract that contains three contract lines with such information .
Finally , the contract lines will contain this data .
# # # Distribution Based on Line Amount
* Line Discount Amount = Line Value - Line Amount

title : How to Put Away Production Output
# How to : Put Away Production or Assembly Output
In advanced warehouse configurations where the location requires both put-away and receive processing , you create either an internal put-away document or a movement document to put away the output .
The first step in creating putting output away is to create the inbound warehouse request . This request informs the warehouse that the production or assembly order output is ready to be put away .
# # To create the inbound warehouse request
# # To put output away with an inventory put-away
4 . Fill in the put-away lines as appropriate .
If you only need to post setup or run time on the last operation , then set the output quantity on the last operation to 0 . Alternatively , you can choose not to post the last line at all by simply deleting it

title : Set Up Special Sales Prices and Discounts for Customers
# How to : Record Special Sales Prices and Discounts
The different price and discount agreements that apply when selling to different customers must be defined so that the agreed rules and values are applied to sales documents that you create for the customers .
Concerning discounts , you can set up and use two types of sales discounts :
Because sales prices and sales line discounts are based on a combination of item and customer , you can also perform this configuration from the item card of the item where the rules and values apply .
# # To set up a sales price for a customer
# # To set up a sales line discount for a customer
When you have decided which customers are eligible for invoice discounts , enter the invoice discount code on the customer cards and set up the terms for each code .
2 . Open the customer card for a customer that will be eligible for invoice discounts .
&gt; Invoice discount codes are represented by existing customer cards . This enables you to quickly assign invoice discount terms to customers by picking the name of another customer who will have the same terms .
Proceed to set up new the sales invoice discount terms .
# # To work with sales invoice discounts and service charges
When you use invoice discounts , the size of the invoice amount determines the size of the discount that is granted .
Before you can use invoice discounts with sales , you must enter certain information in the program . You must decide :
- which customers will be granted this type of discount .
- which discount percentages you will use .
In addition to ( or instead of ) a discount percentage , you can link a service charge amount to a specific invoice amount .

title : Design Details - Monitoring the Projected Inventory Level and the Reorder Point
# Design Details : Monitoring the Projected Inventory Level and the Reorder Point
Inventory is a type of supply , but for inventory planning , the planning system distinguishes between two inventory levels :
* Projected inventory
* Projected available inventory
The projected available inventory is the part of the projected inventory that at a given point in time is available to fulfill demand . The projected available inventory is used by the planning engine when monitoring the safety stock level .
The projected available inventory is used by the planning system to monitor the safety stock level , since the safety stock must always be available to serve unexpected demand .
Having a tight control of the projected inventory is crucial to detect when the reorder point is reached or crossed and to calculate the right order quantity when using the Maximum Qty. reordering policy .
# # Determining the Projected Inventory Level
The following sequence describes how the projected inventory level is determined :
* When a supply event , such as a purchase order has been totally planned , it will increase the projected inventory on its due date .
* When a subsequent supply event is planned and placed on the time line , the posted decrease reminders are investigated one by one up until the planned date of the supply while updating the projected inventory . During this process , the reorder point level of the internal increase reminder may be reached or crossed .
* If a new supply order is introduced , the system checks if it is entered before the current supply . If it is , the new supply becomes current supply and the balancing procedure starts over .
The following shows a graphical illustration of this principle :
In case of B , the reorder point is reached and a new order is created .
title : Assign Item Charges to Sales and Purchases
# How to : Use Item Charges to Account for Additional Trade Costs
In addition to recording the added cost in you inventory value , you can use the Item Charges feature for the following :
- Identify the landed cost of an item for making more accurate decisions on how to optimize the distribution network .
- Break down the unit cost or unit price of an item for analysis purposes .
- include purchase allowances into the unit cost and sales allowances into the unit price .
For both purchase and sales documents , you can assign an item charge in two ways :
- On the document where the items that the item charge relates to are listed . This you typically do for documents that are not yet fully posted .
- On a separate invoice by linking the item charge to a posted receipt or shipment where the items that the item charge relate to are listed .
You use item charge numbers to distinguish between the different kinds of item charges that are used in your company .
# # To assign an item charge directly to the purchase invoice for the item
If you know the item charge at the time when you post a purchase invoice for the item , follow this procedure .
3 . Make sure the purchase invoice has one or more lines of type Item .
10 . If there are more than one invoice lines of type Item , choose one of the four distribution options .
The item charge is now assigned to the purchase invoice . When you post the receipt of the purchase invoice , the items &apos; inventory values are updated with the cost of the item charge .
# # To assign an item charge from a separate invoice to the purchase invoice for the item
If you received an invoice for the item charge after you posted the original purchase receipt , follow this procedure .
The item charge on the separate purchase invoice is now assigned to the item on the posted purchase receipt , thereby updating the item &apos;s inventory value with the cost of the item charge .

title : General Journal Post Line Overview
The old architecture had the following features :
* There was extensive use of global variables , which increased the possibility of hidden errors due to use of variables with the wrong scope .
* Several procedures that were only used locally and were only meant to be used locally were not marked as local .
* Most procedures had no parameters and used global variables . Some used parameters and overrode global variables with locals .
* Code patterns for searching the general ledger accounts and creating general ledger and VAT entries was not standardized and varied from place to place . In addition , there was a lot of code duplication and broken symmetry between customer and vendor code .
* Standardized patterns for the search of general ledger accounts have been implemented by using helper functions from Posting Group tables .
* A Posting Engine Framework has been implemented to manage the start and finish of transactions and to isolate the creation to general ledger and VAT entries , the collection of VAT adjustment , and the calculation of additional currency amounts .
* Code duplication has been eliminated .
* Many helper functions have been transferred to corresponding customer and vendor ledger entry tables .

&gt; VAT is calculated separately for the main account and the balancing account , so they can use different VAT percentage rates .
# # Working with Recurring journals
# # Working with Standard Journals
When you have created journal lines which you know you are likely to create again later , you can save them as a standard journal before you post the journal . This functionality applies to item journals and general journals .
&gt; The following procedure refers to the item journal , but the information also applies to the general journal .
# # # To save a standard journal
2 . Enter one or more journal lines .
3 . Select the journal lines that you want to reuse .
If you have already created one or more standard item journals and you want to replace one of these with the new set of item journal lines , in the Code field , select the code you want .
When you have finished saving the standard item journal , the Item Journal window is displayed so you can proceed to post it , knowing that it can easily be recreated next time you need to post the same or similar lines .
# # # To reuse a standard journal
The Standard Item Journals window opens showing codes and descriptions for all existing standard item journals .
Now the item journal is filled with the lines you saved as the standard item journal . If journal lines already existed in the item journal , the inserted lines will be placed under the existing journal lines .
If the inserted item journal lines contain saved unit amounts that you do not want to post , you can quickly adjust it to the current value of the item as follows .

title : How to Create Blanket Sales Orders
# How to : Work with Blanket Sales Orders
A blanket sales order represents a framework for a long-term agreement between you and your customer .
On the blanket order , each separate shipment can be set up as an order line , which can then be converted into a sales order at the time of shipping .
An example of when a blanket sales order could be used is if a customer calls and places an order of 1000 units of an item and they want the items to be delivered in 250 units every week over the next month .
&gt; Blanket purchase orders work in a similar way as blanket sales orders . This documentation does not cover blanket purchase orders .
# # To create a blanket sales order
The following applies to sales orders after they have been created from blanket sales orders :
- It is important to remember that the sales order line quantity must not exceed the quantity of the associated blanket order line . Otherwise , posting of the sales order will not be possible .
- The blanket order number and line number are recorded as properties of the sales lines when created from a blanket order .
# # To view the status of a blanket purchase order
# # To view unposted and posted blanket sales order lines
The link between the blanket sales order and the originating sales order , and any other sales document , is retained after posting as a list of posted and unposted sales order invoice lines .

title : How to Create a Production Forecast
# How to : Create a Production Forecast
You can create sales and production forecasts with the * * Production Forecast * * window .
# # Sales Forecasts and Production Forecasts
- The production forecast is the production planner &apos;s projection of how many end items and derived subassemblies to produce in specific periods to meet the forecasted sales .
In most cases , then , the production planner modifies the sales forecast to fit the conditions of production , yet still satisfies the sales forecast .
The component forecast can be seen as an option forecast in relation to a parent item . This can , for example , be useful if the planner can estimate the demand for the component .
The forecast period is valid from its starting date until the date the next forecast starts . The time interval window gives you multiple choices to insert the demand at a specific date in a period . It is therefore recommended not to change the forecast period scope unless you want to move all forecast entries to the starting date of this period .
It can be stated in the manufacturing setup if . Note , though , that if location-based forecasts are viewed in isolation , the overall forecast may not be representative .

# Understanding Assemble to Order and Assemble to Stock
Assembly items can be supplied in the following two processes :
You typically use * assemble to order * for items that you do not want to stock because you expect to customize them to customer requests or because you want to minimize the inventory carrying cost . The supporting functionality includes :
- Ability to customize assembly items when taking a sales order .
- Overview of availability of the assembly item and its components .
- Ability to reserve assembly components immediately to guarantee order fulfillment .
- Function to determine profitability of the customized order by rolling up price and cost .
- Integration to the warehouse to make assembly and shipping easier .
- Ability to assemble to order at the point of making a sales quote or a blanket sales order .
- Ability to combine inventory quantities with assemble-to-order quantities .
In the assemble-to-order process , the item is assembled in response to a sales order and with a one-to-one link between the assembly order and the sales order .
An example why you would want to modify the quantity to assemble is that you want to partially post shipment of inventory quantities before the assembly output can be shipped .
&#124; &#124; Sales Order Line &#124; Assembly Order Hheader &#124;
Based on the above situation , you can only modify the * * Quantity to Assemble * * field as follows :

title : Revalue Fixed Assets
# How to : Revalue Fixed Assets
Revaluation of fixed assets can consist of appreciations , write-downs , or general value adjustments .
When the value of a fixed asset has increased , you post a journal line with a higher amount , an appreciation , to the depreciation book . The new amount is recorded as an appreciation according to the fixed asset posting setup .
When the value of a fixed asset has decreased , you post a journal line with a lower amount , a write-down , to the depreciation book . The new amount is recorded as a write-down according to the fixed asset posting setup .
# # To post an appreciation from the fixed asset G / L journal
# # To post a write-down from the fixed asset G / L journal
# # To perform general revaluation of fixed assets
&gt; If the index figures are for simulation purposes only , you can create a special depreciation book to store them in . Then these entries will not affect any of the other depreciation books .
# # To post additional acquisition costs
The depreciation percentage is calculated as :
# # # Example - Posting Additional Acquisition Costs
A machine is purchased on August 1 , 2000 . The acquisition cost is 4,800 . The depreciation method is straight-line over four years .
On September 15 , 2000 , an invoice is posted for painting the machine . The invoice amount is 480 .
15 days of depreciation ( from 09 / 01 / 00 to 09 / 15 / 00 ) is calculated as :
title : Design Details - Loading the Inventory Profiles
To sort out the many sources of demand and supply , the planning system organizes them on two timelines called inventory profiles .
- Released production orders where consumption or output has been posted .
- Assembly orders where consumption or output has been posted .
- Transfer orders where shipment has been posted .
- Purchase orders where receipt has been posted .
Apart from loading demand and supply types , certain types are loaded with attention to special rules and dependencies that are described in the following .
# # Item Dimensions are Separated
# # Serial / Lot Numbers are Loaded by Specification Level
Attributes in the form of serial / lot numbers are loaded into the inventory profiles along with the demand and supply that they are assigned to .
&gt; There are no dedicated prioritization rules for serial / lot-numbered demand and supply , other than the level of specification defined by their combinations of serial and lot numbers and the item tracking setup of the involved items .
Another reason that serial / lot numbered supply is inflexible is that serial / lot numbers are generally assigned so late in the process that it would be confusing if changes are suggested .
# # Order-to-Order Links are Never Broken
&gt; Forecasts should not lead to creating supply orders that are bound by an order-to-order link . If the forecast is used , it should only be used as a generator of dependent demand in a manufacturing environment .
# # Component Need is Loaded according to Production Order Changes
When handling production orders , the planning system must monitor the needed components before loading them into the demand profile . Component lines that result from an amended production order will replace those of the original order . This ensures that the planning system establishes that planning lines for component need are never duplicated .
The safety stock quantity is primarily a demand type and is therefore loaded into the inventory profile on the planning starting date .
# # Forecast Demand is Reduced by Sales Orders
The production forecast expresses anticipated future demand . While actual demand is entered , typically as sales orders for produced items , it consumes the forecast .
A user is required to define a valid forecast period . The date on the forecasted quantity defines the start of the period , and the date on the next forecast defines the end of the period .
# # Blanket Order Demand is Reduced by Sales Orders
The planning calculation considers open sales orders linked to the specific blanket order line , but it does not consider any valid time period . Nor does it consider posted orders , since the posting procedure has already reduced the outstanding blanket order quantity .
title : Set Up Resource Costs , Prices , and Capacity
# How to : Set Up Resources
When resources are used or sold in a job , the prices and costs associated with them are retrieved from the information that you set up .
# # To set up a resource
Create a card for each resource that you want to use in projects .
# # To set up a resource group
You can combine several resources in one resource group . All capacities and budgets of resource groups are accumulated from the individual resources . It is also possible to enter capacities for resource groups either independently of the accumulated values or in addition to them .
# # To set capacity for a resource
4 . For each resource on a line , specify for each period on the columns the number of hours that the resource is available .
# # To set up alternate resource costs
4 . Repeat step 3 for each alternate resource cost that you want to set up .
# # To set up alternate resource prices
In addition to price specified on the resource card , you can set up alternate prices for each resource . These alternate prices can be conditional . They can depend on whether the resource is used with a specific job or work type .
4 . Repeat step 3 for each alternate resource price that you want to set up .
title : Manually Adjust the Costs of Items
# How to : Adjust Item Costs
If you use the FIFO costing method , then an item ’ s unit cost is the actual value of any receipt of the item . Inventory is valuated with the assumption that the first items placed in inventory are sold first .
# # To make general changes in the direct unit cost
# # Understanding Unit Cost Calculation
# # Unit Cost Calculation for Purchases
# # # Costing Method Standard
When you post the purchase , the unit cost from the purchase line or item journal line is copied to the purchase item invoice entry , and it can be seen on the entry list for the item .
# # # All Costing Methods
# # Unit Cost Calculation for Sales
When you sell items , the unit cost is copied from the Unit Cost field on the item card to the sales line or the item journal line .

title : Financial dimensions and posting
# # Chart of accounts and financial dimension components
# # # Default / fixed financial dimensions on the main account
# # Order in which default dimensions are applied during posting
People often have questions about the order that the various components run in . It &apos;s very important that you understand the order that default dimensions are applied in , because this behavior affects the approach that you take to setup .
&#124; Main account &#124; Business unit &#124; Department &#124; Cost center &#124;
&#124; Main account &#124; Name &#124; Legal entity &#124; Department &#124;
When the same journal header setup is used , and the same transaction is posted , the fixed dimension is applied first . Then the balancing logic is applied to help guarantee that every department has a balanced entry . The following illustration shows voucher transactions that include the balancing entry after the fixed dimension is applied .

title : Data import and export jobs
# Data import and export jobs
# # Data import / export process
Here are the steps to import or export data .
- Define the project category .
- Identify the entities to import or export .
- Set the data format for the job .
- Sequence the entities , so that they are processed in logical groups and in an order that makes sense .
- Determine whether to use staging tables .
2 . Validate that the source data and target data are mapped correctly .
3 . Verify the security for your import or export job .
4 . Run the import or export job .
5 . Validate that the job ran as expected by reviewing the job history .
6 . Clean up the staging tables .
The remaining sections of this topic provide more details about each step of the process .
# # Create an import or export job
A data import or export job can be run one time or many times .
# # # Define the project category
We recommend that you take the time to select an appropriate project category for your import or export job . Project categories can help you manage related jobs .
# # # Identify the entities to import or export
# # # Set the data format for the job
&#124; File Format &#124; Row / Column delimiter &#124; XML Style &#124;
# # # Sequence the entities
- Entities in different execution units are processed in parallel .
- In each execution unit , entities are processed in parallel if they have the same level .
- In each level , entities are processed according to their sequence number in that level .
- After one level has been processed , the next level is processed .
You might want to resequence your entities in the following situations :
- If there are no dependencies at all , you can sequence entities at different execution units for maximum optimization .
Use can use the * * Sort by * * option to view the entity list in sequential order .
For import projects , you can choose to truncate records in the entities prior to import . This is useful if your records must be imported into a clean set of tables . This setting is off by default .
# # Validate that the source data and target data are mapped correctly
Mapping is a function that applies to both import and export jobs .
- In the context of an import job , mapping describes which columns in the source file become the columns in the staging table . Therefore , the system can determine which column data in the source file must be copied into which column of the staging table .
- In the context of an export job , mapping describes which columns of the staging table ( that is , the source ) become the columns in the target file .
# # Verify the security for your import or export job
# # # Secure a job by roles and users
You can also restrict a job to specific users . When you secure a job by users instead of roles , there is more control if multiple users are assigned to a role .
# # # Secure a job by legal entity
A job can be secured by roles , users , and legal entity at the same time .
# # Run the import or export job
# # Validate that the job ran as expected
Each job run provides the following details :
Execution details show the state of each data entity that the job processed . Therefore , you can quickly find the following information :
- Which entities were processed
- For an entity , how many records were successfully processed , and how many failed
- The staging records for each entity
You can download the staging data in a file for export jobs , or you can download it as a package for import and export jobs .
From the execution details , you can also open the execution log .
# # Clean up the staging tables
You can also combine the options to further restrict the record set that is deleted .

title : Absence registration in Time and attendance
# Absence registration in Time and attendance
This topic describes the concepts for absence and explains how to handle absence in Time and attendance .
# # Absence that is based on regular work hours
In this case , workers are prompted to enter a reason for their absence . They can specify a reason by selecting an absence code .
Absence codes define the various types of absence . Absence codes are defined by the company .
Various rules can be applied to absence codes . For example , an absence code can be configured to deduct or grant pay .
You can set up automatic absence codes . These absence codes can be used to calculate a worker &apos;s time when no absence is registered . The worker &apos;s time profile determines whether the absence code for standard time or flex time is used .
# # # Set up standard time and flex time
# # # Set up planned absence
# # Examples of the use of absence in a flex profile
The following three examples show how absence is calculated in a profile that has flex periods .
The examples use the following profile .
# # # Example 2 : Signing out in during Standard time period
# # Absence in the calculation and approval process
Worker time registrations must be calculated and approved before they can be transferred to a payroll system as pay items .
# # # Calculate and approve absence
title : Production order cost estimation
This article provides information about production cost estimation . Production cost estimation provides the projected material and capacity consumption costs of producing an item in the planned production order quantity .
Estimates of production costs are based on the following information :
- The quantity on the production order
- The components on the production bills of materials ( BOMs )
- The routing operations in the production route
- The active cost data as of the calculation date
# # View the estimated costs
# # Other uses of cost estimation
A cost estimate also provides the following information :
- Meaningful price quotations
- Estimates of the profitability of the order
- Estimates of raw material usage
- Comparisons of cost information from previous productions
- Budget and forecasting information
- Estimates of the production size that is required in order to maintain a particular cost
title : Nomenclature of product variant numbers and names
# Nomenclature of product variant numbers and names
# # Nomenclature of predefined product variants
Product variants are generated for product masters according to one of three configuration technologies :
- Predefined variants
- Product master name
- Configuration ID or name
- Color ID or name
- Size ID or name
1 . Product master number
In this case , the product variant number for a red , small , polo T-shirt will be TS1234-Red-Small-Polo .
# # Nomenclature of constraint-based configurations
Each component in a product configuration model can have its own configuration nomenclature . Only attributes that belong to the component can be used . Attributes from subcomponents or user requirements can &apos;t be used .
A product configuration model has a root component that has two attributes :
You create a configuration nomenclature that has the following segments :
In this case , the configuration ID for wood material that has a length of 78 will be WoodAAA78 .
# # Nomenclature of dimension-based configurations
You can define a configuration nomenclature for a bill of materials ( BOM ) .
A BOM has four BOM lines that are divided into two configuration groups :
- Configuration group : Cabinet
- BOM line : M0021 , Front grill cloth
- Configuration group : Front grill
- BOM line : M0022 , Front grill metal
3 . Configuration group : Front grill
# # Nomenclature for a combination of product variants and configurations
When you use either the constraint-based configuration technology or the dimension-based configuration technology to configure product variants for a product master , the product variant numbers of the product variants can include the nomenclature from the configuration dimension . Follow these steps to configure variants .
2 . Assign the nomenclature to a product dimension group that has the configuration dimension .
3 . Define a configuration nomenclature for the components or BOMs that will be used to configure the product variants .
# # # Example for constraint-based configurations
For this example , you use a product variant number nomenclature that consists of the following segments :
The configuration nomenclature consists of the following segments :
You enter the following values for segments :
In this case , the product variant number will be M0099 \ _ PlasticAAA12 .
# # # Example for dimension-based configurations
An error occurs if you try to manually create or automatically generate product variants , and more than one product variant ends up with the same product variant number . To avoid this scenario , you should use all active product dimensions in the product dimension group . Alternatively , include a number sequence to help guarantee that the product variant numbers are unique .

title : Production process overview
This topic gives an overview of the production processes . It describes the various stages of production orders , batch orders , and kanbans , from order creation to closing of the financial period .
The choice of the cost measurement methods also defines the requirements for reporting about material and resource consumption during the production process . Typically , actual cost methods require accurate reporting on the job level , whereas periodic costing methods allow for less granular reporting of material and resource consumption .
To select the manufacturing principle that best applies to a particular product and related market , you must consider the requirements of production and logistics , and also customer expectations about delivery lead times .
# # Overview of the production life cycle
The following steps in the production life cycle can occur for all order types of mixed mode manufacturing . However , not all of them are represented as an explicit order status .

This topic describes the various elements that make up a workflow .
A workflow consists of elements . The sections that follow describe each type of element .
A * task * is a unit of work that must be performed . Two types of tasks can be added to a workflow : manual tasks and automated tasks .
A * manual task * is a unit of work that must be performed by a user . For example , an expense report workflow can have manual tasks that require the assigned users to complete the following actions :
- Review the receipts that are submitted together with an expense report .
- Call an employee &apos;s manager .
An * automated task * is a unit of work that must be performed by the system . No human interaction is required . For example , a sales order workflow can have automated tasks that require the system to complete the following actions :
- Perform a credit check .
- Create a customer record for the customer , if a record doesn &apos;t already exist .
- Reject the document .
- Request a change to the document .
- Assign the document to another user for approval .
In this scenario , you might want to create the following line-item workflows :

title : Improvements to statement posting functionality
# Improvements to statement posting functionality
Finance and Operations includes the following validations that are related to these configuration keys :
- Both configuration keys can &apos;t be turned on at the same time .
The following sections describe some of the major improvements for the statement posting feature that appear in the user interface for retail statements and posted statements .
A new state model has been introduced in the statement posting routine across the calculation and posting processes .
The following table describes the various states and their order during the calculation process .
The following table describes the various states and their order during the posting process .
- The user has complete visibility into the state where the error occurred .
- The first section shows the current status of the statement , together with the error code and a detailed error message , if an error occurred .
- The second section shows the various states of the calculation process . Visual cues indicate states that have been successfully run , states that could not be run because of errors , and states that haven &apos;t yet been run .
Additionally , the header of the second and third sections shows the overall status of the relevant process .
The * * Sales order detail * * tab of an aggregated transaction shows the following information :
The aggregated transaction view provides the following benefits :
- The user has visibility into the aggregated transactions that failed during sales order creation and the sales orders that failed during invoicing .
- The user has visibility into how transactions are aggregated .
- Aggregated XML file make it easier to identify issues during sales order creation and invoicing .
Currently , the program shows this data only for posted statements .
Other , back-end improvements that users can see have been made to the statement posting feature . Here are some examples :
- The occurrence of deadlock on retail transaction tables is reduced by introducing additional extension tables and by doing insert operations instead of update operations on the retail transaction tables .
- Statements are efficiently queued for processing by prioritizing the statements that have the maximum number of transactions .
# # General guidance about the statement posting process
- We recommend that you run the statement posting process in a batch , because batch runs take advantage of the power of the batch framework in terms of multithreading . Multithreading is required in order to handle the huge volumes of transactions that are normally seen in statement postings .
- We recommend that you use aggregation while you calculate and post statements . Therefore , the following settings are recommended for some of the aggregation parameters :

# # # Determining the legal entity for an invoice
Invoices that are imported via data packages can be associated with the legal entity that they belong to in two ways :
This list page includes the following fields that come in via the feed :
&gt; The line reference isn ’ t the invoice ID .
This list page also has a preview pane that you can used in the following ways :
+ View the whole list of attachments for the invoice , if any attachments came with the invoice .
# # # Exception details page
In the preceding illustration , there weren ’ t any lines for the vendor invoice header that came in . Therefore , the lines section is empty .
The exception details page supports the following operation :
# # # Shared service vs. organization-based exception processing
+ By user role
+ By user
+ By legal entity
If security is configured for the invoice import job , the exceptions list page honors those settings . Users will be able to see only the invoice exception records that this setup allows them to see .
To help you easily view the attachments for vendor invoices , the following pages that are used in the invoicing process now provide an attachment viewer :
Here is the main functionality that the attachment viewer provides :
+ View multi-page TIFF files .
+ Perform the following actions on image files :
+ Highlight parts of the image .
+ Block parts of the image .
+ Add annotations to the image .
+ Zoom in and out on the image .
+ Pan the image .
+ Undo and redo actions .
+ Fit the image to size .
# # # Show / hide invoice attachments

title : Quality management processes
This article provides information about the quality management process for nonconforming products . It describes how you can use quality control functionality , how to define and maintain nonconformances , and how to handle corrections .
# # Controlling the quality management process
Here are some of the ways that you can control the quality management process :
- Create quality orders that are based on trigger points such as “ at product receipt ” for inbound operations or “ at product pick-up ” for outbound operations .
- Document test results , and determine whether the results meet the established test criteria and acceptable quality levels .
- Use document management for detailed product specifications and user-specific notes as part of reporting during the inspection process .
- Maintain nonconforming products , and correlate these products with additional nonconformance information to track down the original cause of a problem .
- Schedule error correction processes by using correction handling that is linked to quality orders .
# # Product testing and quality orders
Product testing is typically referred to as quality control and uses quality orders . By using the quality control functionality , you can do the following :
- Record the test results in a quality order , validate the test results against the AQL , and print a certificate of analysis that displays the test results .
The following table lists the six default nonconformance types and describes the information that must be recorded for each type .
&#124; Nonconformance type &#124; Source information &#124;
&#124; Production &#124; The production order number or a lot number of a production order transaction . For example , the nonconformance might be related to a specific batch that was produced . &#124;
&#124; Internal &#124; The quality order number or a lot number of a quality order transaction . For example , the nonconformance might be related to the tests that are performed as part of a quality order or to an employee &apos;s concern about product quality . &#124;
&#124; Co-product production &#124; A co-product production order nonconformance that is related to batch production orders . &#124;

title : Demand forecasting overview
Demand forecasting is used to predict independent demand from sales orders and dependent demand at any decoupling point for customer orders . The enhanced demand forecast reduction rules provide an ideal solution for mass customization .
# # Key features of demand forecasting
Here are some of the main features of demand forecasting :
- Generate a statistical baseline forecast that is based on historical data .
- Use a dynamic set of forecast dimensions .
- Visualize demand trends , confidence intervals , and adjustments of the forecast .
- Authorize the adjusted forecast to be used in planning processes .
- Remove outliers .

title : Movement of inventory with associated work in Warehouse management
# Movement of inventory with associated work in Warehouse management
Using movement of inventory , you can decide which warehouse workers are allowed to move reserved inventory . This provides a flexibility in regulated warehouses where you can decide to not allow a worker to choose a new pick location for pick work that is already created . It also allows a warehouse manager to control which capabilities some less experienced workers should have .
The flexibility to manage the daily operations of warehouse workers can be useful in scenarios such as these :
A company has a relatively small receiving area , and it ’ s congested with pallets and boxes awaiting put away . A large shipment is expected on the current day , so the receiving clerk decides to clear up the receiving area by moving some of the pallets to a secondary inbound staging area .
An experienced warehouse worker notices an opportunity in a warehouse to consolidate items in one location instead of having them divided across 3 nearby locations with little quantity on each . The worker wants to consolidate the quantity by moving items from each of these locations into the same location and onto the same license plate .
Only the ad hoc movement is currently supported . That means that you will not be able to move reserved inventory through the movement by template mobile device menu items .
# # # Set up permission to move reserved inventory for individual workers
It can also be downloaded individually through KB number 3192548 .

title : Replenishment with withdrawal kanbans
This topic describes how the withdrawal kanban is used for material replenishment for manufacturing activities .
The following scenario shows a pull-based replenishment system where a pull signal triggers the creation of a kanban to replenish material for a production process .
1 . Withdrawal kanban
2 . Kanban “ from ” location and put location for warehouse work
3 . Kanban “ to ” location and production input location
5 . Warehouse work for kanban picking
6 . Warehouse locations for raw material
# # Configure warehouse work for kanban picking for the withdrawal kanban
# # Configure the withdrawal kanban
The empty signal can be configured to occur automatically when a kanban is completed . Alternatively , the empty signal can be set up as a manual interaction that is given either from the Kanban transfer board or from a menu on the hand-held device . The Kanban transfer board is the workspace where all activities in the kanban life cycle are managed .
In this scenario , the picking work in the material warehouse is processed as one activity . The transfer activity between the material warehouse and the production warehouse is processed as a separate activity . This approach can be useful if , for example , there is a large physical distance between the two warehouses . In this case , the kanban transfer activity can represent a truck load .
# # Scenario 2 : Automatically complete the transfer activity when kanban picking work is processed
In the following scenario , the transfer activity of the withdrawal kanban is configured to transfer between two locations in the same warehouse . The transfer activity of the withdrawal kanban is set up so that it ’ s completed automatically .
1 . Shared warehouse for raw materials and production
2 . Warehouse locations for raw materials
3 . Kanban “ from ” location and put location for warehouse work
4 . Withdrawal kanban
5 . Production input location

title : Immediate replenishment
Immediate replenishment lets you replenish inventory immediately after a location directive line fails to allocate inventory . The replenishment is based on a single line in the setup of the location directive . If inventory isn &apos;t on hand in the unit of measure that is specified by that line , replenishment of that unit of measure occurs immediately .
Immediate replenishment provides an alternative to the method where the allocation of inventory is based on more lines in the location directive , and where the demand is summed at the end of the allocation and replenished in the unit of measure that is specified by the last line in the location directive .
The benefits of using immediate replenishment are that replenishment can be limited by specific units and the quantity can be directed to specific locations .
Immediate replenishment is used during wave execution if allocation fails for a location directive line that a replenishment template is set for .
# # Set up immediate replenishment
The replenishment template is applied if the location directive line fails to allocate a dedicated unit of measure .
- Make sure that there is enough on-hand inventory at the locations where the demand replenishment template searches for on-hand inventory for replenishment .

title : Packing slip updates for returns
# Packing slip updates for returns
The packing slip update can be processed in either the item arrival journal or the return order .
As part of the process for posting packing slips , the packing slip reference number from the customer ’ s shipping documents can be associated with the order lines . This association is optional and for reference only . It does not create any transactional updates .
If not all of the expected return items have arrived , you should include only the quantity that has been received in the packing slip update . Leave the remaining items on the order until the rest of the return shipment has arrived .
When you update a packing slip for a returned item that is from a sales agreement , the sales agreement commitment for that item is automatically updated to reflect the change in the quantity or the amount .
title : Consolidated batch orders
This article describes the concept of consolidated batch orders .
A bulk item that is produced is considered a parent item , whereas a packed item is considered a child item . The relation between the bulk item and the packed item is expressed in a bulk item conversion . This bulk item conversion is defined on the bulk item itself .
Packed items can be packaged into containers of either a single size or multiple sizes that are considered one unit . By consolidating the orders for a bulk item , you can see all the related batch orders in a single view that can help you determine any remaining work that must be completed .
A consolidated batch order can contain any combination of the following orders :
- A single bulk order and multiple packed orders
- Multiple bulk orders and multiple packed orders
- Multiple bulk orders and a single packed order
- Only packed orders

This article provides information about purchasing policies . A purchasing policy is a collection of rules that control the requisition process . Purchasing policies help procurement administrators implement their procurement strategy by creating a policy structure that is aligned with the organization ’ s strategic purchasing requirements .
# # Assigning policies to organizations
# # Determining which rule to apply
Depending on how you configure your purchasing policies , multiple rules can affect the users in an organization . The following examples illustrate different ways that you can configure purchasing policies and specify how policies are applied when a transaction occurs .
# # # Example 1 : Simple purchasing policy configuration
Organizations that are small and less complex can set up purchasing policies by legal entity , and can use only the Companies organization hierarchy .
When an employee in legal entity 2222 creates a purchase requisition , the policy rules are derived from policy B .
# # # Example 2 : Complex purchasing policy configuration
Therefore , policy 456 is applied to the purchase requisition that Sam creates , and no minimum order quantity is required for the purchase requisition .
# # # Catalog policy rule
# # # Category access policy rule
The category access policy rule determines which categories users have access to when they create purchase requisitions . If no rule is specified , all the procurement categories can be added to the purchase requisition .
# # # Category policy rule
The category policy rule defines how users can select vendors for each category . It also defines requirements for the receiving and invoicing processes .
# # # Re-approval rule for purchase orders
The re-approval rule is an optional rule that defines the criteria for requiring re-approval when a purchase order is changed . The selected fields are evaluated in the purchase order workflow when the &quot; Requires purchase order re-approval &quot; condition is set up in the workflow .
# # # Purchase requisition control rule
The purchase requisition control rule is an optional rule . When you create rules of this type , you can set options on various tabs :
- On the * * Dates * * tab , you can configure whether the accounting date is the same as the requested date
# # # Requisition purpose rule
# # # Replenishment category access policy rule
# # # Replenishment control rule
# # # Purchase order creation and demand consolidation rule
The purchase order creation and demand consolidation rule defines the policy rules to use when a purchase order is generated from an approved purchase requisition . When you create rules of this type , you can set options on various tabs :
# # Data flow in Prospect to cash
The following synchronization tasks are required before synchronization of sales invoice headers and lines can occur :
&#124; CDS sales order headers &#124; SalesOrders &#124;

&#124; Sales manager &#124; Mng-people – Manage people who report to you . &#124;
# # # Areas of responsibility
# # # Position creation and maintenance
- You can view a history of position-related system changes in an easy-to-access list page .
- You can create reason codes that your users can select when they create or modify positions .
- You can create personnel action types and assign a number sequence to personnel actions .
- You can set up workflow so that position additions and changes can require approval .
Every position has a length of time that the position is effective . This length of time is referred to as duration . For example , summer positions might have duration of May 1 , 2015 until August 31 , 2015 .
When you assign a worker to a position , you fill that position . You can assign workers to multiple positions , but only one worker can be assigned to a position at the same time .
1 . Create a custom position hierarchy type called “ Widget ” to create a hierarchy that includes positions responsible for working on the widget cleaner product .

This article provides an overview of the bonus depreciation functionality .
You can calculate bonus depreciation by using the proposal process , or you can create manual bonus depreciation transactions . You can &apos;t create bonus depreciation transactions if depreciation transactions or depreciation adjustment transactions exist for that asset book .
When you use the proposal process to calculate bonus depreciation , all existing bonus transactions are included in the calculation of the basis . The calculation also includes any previous bonus depreciations that you manually entered for the asset .
The following bonus depreciations are associated with an asset book :
The next bonus depreciation amount , for the Liberty Zone depreciation , is calculated as follows :
If the bonus depreciation amount is more than the remaining acquisition cost , the bonus depreciation amount is either the result of the bonus depreciation calculation or the remaining acquisition cost , whichever amount is less .
If the remaining acquisition cost is 0 ( zero ) or less , bonus depreciation transactions isn &apos;t generated .
When bonus depreciation is calculated by using the proposal process , a bonus depreciation transaction is created for all applicable bonus depreciation records that are associated with the asset book .
You can create an unlimited number of bonus depreciation records . After you assign those records to the asset group book , they are applied to the asset book .
Bonus depreciation is entered as either a percentage or a fixed amount . When you post depreciation proposals , bonus depreciation transactions are posted to the book as separate transactions from the depreciation transactions .

- Rates for interest earnings − These represent revenue that is earned by charging interest on invoices or interest notes .
- Rates for interest payments − These represent a cost that is paid for interest on credit notes .
Both of these rate types can exist at the same time and in the same interest code . Interest rates can be based on three calculation types :
- Interest by percentage .
- Interest by amount .
- Interest by range , which results in a single percentage or amount .
# # Interest rates based on a percentage
You can set up interest rates that calculate a specified percentage .
- Interest amount applies to all currencies .
- Optional interest amount limits can be entered .
# # Interest rates based on amounts
You can set up interest rates that calculate a specified amount per currency .
- An interest amount is specified for each currency in the interest code .
# # Interest rates based on ranges
You set up the range information as follows .

This article describes , at a high level , how purchasing professionals can set up and maintain procurement catalogs . Procurement catalogs define the items and services that company employees can order for internal use .
- Configure your procurement category hierarchy before you create the catalog .
Several factors determine the products that employees can order and the procurement categories that they can use when they create purchase requisitions :
- The category access policy rule in the purchasing policy determines which procurement categories are available in the purchase requisition . If no rule is defined , all procurement categories are available .
- The catalog policy rule specifies the catalog that is used . If no catalog policy rule is defined , the category access rule alone determines the products that an employee can order on the requisition .
The following table describes the tasks that must be completed before a purchasing professional can create a procurement catalog .
# # Setting up a catalog
title : Sales tax calculation methods in the Origin field
# Sales tax calculation methods in the Origin field
This article explains the options in the Origin field on the sales tax codes page and how sales tax is calculated based on the selected option for a sales tax code .
For each sales tax code that you create in the Sales tax codes page , you must select the method of calculation to apply to the tax base amount in the Origin field .
# # Percentage of net amount
The Percentage of net amount calculation method is the default value in the Origin field . The sales tax is calculated as a percentage of the purchase or sales amount , excluding any other sales taxes .
# # Percentage of gross amount
If you select the Percentage of gross amount method , the sales tax is calculated as a percentage of the gross sales amount . The gross amount is the line net amount plus all taxes and fees for the line except the one tax with Origin = Percentage of gross amount .
The tax authority has imposed special duties on an item . The duty amounts are added to the net amount before sales tax is calculated . Given the following sales tax codes :
- SALESTAX = 25 % , using the Percentage of gross amount calculation method
When you select Percentage of sales tax in the Origin field , sales tax is calculated as a percentage of the sales tax that is selected in the Sales tax on sales tax field . The sales tax that is selected in the Sales tax on sales tax field is calculated first . The second sales tax is then calculated based on the first sales tax amount .
Given the following sales tax codes :
- SALESTAX = 25 % , using the Percentage of gross amount method
&#124; Multilevel tax on tax calculations are not possible . A tax cannot be calculated based on a tax which already is calculated based on another tax . Multiple single level tax on tax codes can be calculated on a transaction . &#124;
# # # Amount per unit , additional option
On the Calculation tab , you can select whether an amount per unit calculated tax is calculated before other tax codes and added to the net amount before other tax codes with Origin = Percentage of net amount are calculated .
Assume we calculate 2 tax codes on a transaction :
We sell 1 piece of an item at a unit price of 10.00
# # # # Example 1
# # # # Example 2
# # # # Example 3
# # # # Example 4
# # Calculated percentage of net amount
The Calculated percentage of net amount handles tax calculation differently depending on the setting of the Amounts include sales tax parameter for the document or journal .

title : Solver strategy for product configuration
# Solver strategy for product configuration
This topic describes how you can use the solver strategy to improve the performance of product configuration .
The solver strategy concept now consists of the following strategies :
Real customer implementation studies have shown that a change in the solver strategy for a product configuration model can reduce the response time from minutes to milliseconds . Therefore , it &apos;s worth the effort to try different solver strategies to find the most efficient strategy for your product configuration model .
# # Change the settings for the solver strategy
Currently , there is no logic that automatically detects which solver strategy will be the most efficient strategy for constraint-based product configuration . Therefore , you must try the solver strategies one by one .
The following table provides recommendations about the solver strategy to use in various scenarios .
&#124; Solver strategy &#124; Use the strategy in this scenario &#124;
The following examples show how to use segments to create number sequence formats . In particular , the examples demonstrate the effects of using scope segments .
# # # Expense report numbers
* * Example of formatted number * * : CS-EXPENSE-0039
# # # Sales order numbers
# # # Purchase requisition numbers
In the following example , purchase requisition numbers are organization-wide .
Performance considerations for number sequences
Consider the following information about how the configuration of number sequences can affect system performance before you set up number sequences .
# # # Continuous and non-continuous number sequences
Unless there is a regulatory requirement that you use continuous number sequences , we recommend that you use non-continuous number sequences for better performance .
# # # Automatic cleanup of number sequences
Carefully consider server usage when you plan the cleanup process . We recommend that you perform the cleanup as a batch job during non-peak hours .

title : LIFO Date with physical value and marking
# LIFO Date with physical value and marking
We recommend a periodic inventory closing when you use the LIFO Date inventory model .
The following examples show the effect of using LIFO Date in three configurations :
- LIFO Date without the * * Include physical value * * option
- LIFO Date with the * * Include physical value * * option
- LIFO Date with marking
# # LIFO Date without the Include physical value option
In this example , the item model group isn &apos;t marked to include physical value . The illustration that follows shows these transactions :
The new running average cost price reflects the average of the financially updated transactions at USD 15.00 .
- Inventory transactions are represented by vertical arrows .
- Receipts into inventory are represented by vertical arrows above the timeline .
- Issues out of inventory are represented by vertical arrows below the timeline .
- Above ( or below ) each vertical arrow , the value of the inventory transaction is specified in the format Quantity @ Unitprice .
- An inventory transaction value that is enclosed in parentheses indicates that the inventory transaction is physically posted into inventory .
- An inventory transaction value that isn &apos;t enclosed in parentheses indicates that the inventory transaction is financially posted into inventory .
- Each new receipt or issue transaction is designated by a new label .
- Inventory closings are represented by a red vertical dashed line and the label * Inventory Close * .
# # LIFO Date with the Include physical value option
In this example , the item model group is marked to include physical value .
The illustration that follows shows these transactions :
The new running average cost price reflects the average of the financially updated transactions at USD 20.00 .
# # LIFO Date with marking
Marking is a process that lets you link , or mark , an issue transaction to a receipt transaction . Marking can occur either before or after a transaction is posted . You can use marking when you want to be sure of the exact cost of inventory when the transaction is posted or the inventory close is performed .
Before inventory close is performed , these two transactions can still be marked to each other .
You can also mark an issue transaction to a receipt after the transaction is posted . You can match or mark an issue transaction for an open receipt transaction for an inventoried item from a posted inventory adjustment journal .
The new running average cost price reflects the average of the financially and physically updated transactions at USD 27.50 .

# Customer payment insights ( preview )
Payment predictions allow organizations to improve their business processes by helping to :
- Easily identify the invoices that are predicted to be paid late .
- Take appropriate measures to improve chances of getting paid on time .
For each open invoice , Customer payment insights ( preview ) predicts three payment probabilities :
- Probability of payment being made on time ( within the invoice due date ) .
- Probability of payment being made within 30 days of the invoice due date .
- Probability of payment being made beyond 30 days of the invoice due date .
The probability of payments can be viewed in the prediction section .
Each invoice is also assigned a winning probability of payment using one of the three predicted payment probabilities scenarios defined above . The scenario with the highest probability of payment is the winning scenario .
In addition to payment predictions , the Customer Payment Insights ( preview ) can use optimization strategies to improve the chances of getting paid on time . This lets organizations do &apos; What if &apos; analysis by allowing users to adjust invoice and customer parameters and then compare the corresponding effect on the probability of receiving payment on invoices on time .
&gt; Currently , only discount is available as an optimization strategy for Customer payment insights ( preview ) .

# # # # Planned breaks
# # # # Registered breaks
# # # # Paid and unpaid breaks
# # # Example of a planned break
Consider the following time profile that includes an unpaid break for lunch .
&gt; The system calculated 0.5 hours of unpaid break time , and that time isn &apos;t part of the pay time .
# # # Example of a registered break
Consider the following time profile that doesn &apos;t include planned breaks .
When the registrations are calculated , the time for the activities is calculated .
If the planned break had been paid instead of unpaid , the calculation result would look like this .
# # # Pay items and paid breaks
Consider the following time profile .
&#124; Wage type &#124; Pay type &#124; Pay units &#124; Rate &#124;
# # How the cost of paid breaks is allocated to projects and production orders
The hourly cost on project activities and production jobs can be set up so that it &apos;s determined either by the pay rates that are calculated in Time and attendance or by the cost categories that are defined for the activities .
# # # Cost calculation based on pay rates that are calculated in Time and attendance
The following example shows how the hourly cost is calculated when the cost is set up so that it &apos;s calculated based on pay rates .
Consider the following registrations that use the same time profile as the previous example .
&#124; Registration type &#124; Time &#124; Cost price per hour &#124;
# # Scenarios based on various combinations of work hour registrations
The following scenarios show the pay items and entries for approval that are generated for workers based on their registrations . All the scenarios are based on the following time profile .
Here is the resulting pay item after the registrations are transferred .
The following example shows how a worker &apos;s flex account can be reduced by converting the absence period to a Flex- period .
If the worker selects an absence code for illegal absence , here is how the resulting pay item will look after the registration is transferred .
If the worker selects an absence code for legal absence , and the absence code is set up to reduce her flex account , here is how the resulting pay items will look after the registrations are transferred .

The article provides information about the key concepts in modeling a lean organization .
# # Production flows in lean manufacturing
# # Semi-finished products ( non-BOM levels )
# # Products and material in work in progress
# # Value streams and value stream mapping
The value stream itself is modeled as an operating unit . Therefore , the value stream can be used as a financial dimension .
# # Costing for lean manufacturing based on the production flow
The periodic consolidation of the cost for a production flow corrects the related WIP account and enables variances to be determined for the products that are supplied by the production flow .

title : Calculations for product configuration models FAQ
# Calculations for product configuration models FAQ
This topic describes calculations for product configuration models and explains how to use calculations together with constraints .
# # What is a calculation ?
A calculation is an element that you can use in a product configuration model . Calculations complement constraints by letting you use decimal numbers to calculate values when you configure a product . Additionally , calculations have a larger set of available operators than constraints have .
A calculation consists of a target attribute and a calculation expression .
# # What is a target attribute ?
A target attribute is an attribute that receives the result of the calculation expression .
In the following expression , the target attribute is a tablecloth measurement :
# # What attribute types can be set to target attributes ?
All attribute types that the product configurator supports can be set to target attributes , except text without a fixed list .
# # Can the value of a target attribute restrict the values of the input attributes in a calculation ?
In the following expression , the target for the calculation is the length of a power cord , and the input value is a color :
# # When do calculations occur ?
Calculations occur when a value has been provided for all input attributes .
You can overwrite the value that is calculated for the target attribute , unless the target attribute is set as hidden or read-only .
# # How do I set a target attribute as hidden or read-only ?
To set an attribute as hidden or read-only , follow these steps .
# # Can a calculation overwrite the values that I set ?
No . The values that you set when you configure a product are the values that are used . The calculation that occurs when the input values in a calculation are changed can ’ t overwrite the values that you provide for a specific attribute .
# # What happens if I remove an input value in a calculation ?
If you remove an input value in a calculation , the value of the target attribute is also removed .
# # Why do I receive an error message that says that my model is in contradiction ?
- A value is divided by 0 ( zero ) .
- A conflict exists between the following two elements :
- The values that are available for an attribute and are limited by a constraint
- A value that is generated by a calculation
# # Why do I receive an error message even though I successfully validated my product model ?
Calculations aren &apos;t included in the validation . You must test the product configuration model to find errors in calculations . To test a product configuration model , follow these steps .

title : Transportation management overview
# # Planning transportation in Finance and Operations
In Transportation management , transportation planning can be based either on orders or on the shipments that are created based on those orders . The shipments always exist at some point in time but aren &apos;t required for transportation planning . Transfer orders are part of the outbound scenario and can be planned together with sales orders .

# # Monitoring and controlling warehouse work
Additionally , you can use the estimated time in the rules for automatically splitting work during work creation . In this way , you can load balance work , based on the expected time to complete the tasks .
Analysis of the time that is used to process work items can help drive improvements in the warehouse workers ’ efficiency . The following reports are available to help with this analysis :
title : Dual currency
Transaction currency amount \ &gt; Accounting currency amount \ &gt; Reporting currency amount
Here is the new calculation :
Transaction currency amount \ &gt; Accounting currency amount
Transaction currency amount \ &gt; Reporting currency amount
Various reports and inquiries now show both reporting currency amounts and accounting currency amounts . Not every report and inquiry has been updated . For example , reports that show amounts only in the transaction currency haven &apos;t changed .
The changes follow one of two patterns :
- If the report or inquiry had enough space to show amounts in both the accounting currency and the reporting currency , the reporting currency amounts were added .
- If the report or inquiry didn &apos;t have enough space to show amounts in both currencies , an option was added so that users can select which currency is shown .
For various reports and inquiries , logic was also added to suppress the reporting currency amounts if the reporting currency is the same as the accounting currency , or if the reporting currency wasn &apos;t defined on the ledger for the legal entity .
The following modules use the reporting currency as a second accounting currency :
If a reporting currency was defined on the ledger , the general ledger already tracked reporting currency amounts on every accounting entry . However , those amounts are now translated from the transaction currency amounts .
The following additional changes were made in the * * General ledger * * module :
# # # Accounts payable and Accounts receivable
- The aging process has been updated so that an organization can view the aging buckets in either the accounting currency or the reporting currency .
# # # Cash and bank management
- No processes in Cash and bank management were changed , but various reports and inquiries were updated so that they show reporting currency amounts . The cash flow forecasting reports are an exception . They weren &apos;t updated to include the reporting currency amounts .
In addition , major changes have been made to the depreciation process . These changes require user action after an upgrade . It &apos;s important that you read and understand the following changes , even if you aren &apos;t yet using Fixed assets .
- The way that the depreciation process determines the reporting currency amount has changed . The following scenario compares how depreciation previously determined the reporting currency amount and how it determines the reporting currency amount now .
An asset is acquired and posted with the following amounts . Note that the reporting currency amount is posted in the general ledger , but it isn &apos;t stored in the Fixed asset subledger tables .
The depreciation process has been changed so that the reporting currency amount is also calculated by using the depreciation method . Here are the results when depreciation is run on the asset .
When the depreciation proposal is run , it calculates both the accounting currency amount and the reporting currency amount by using the depreciation method . The amounts are then used in the accounting entry in the general ledger . No translation is done to determine the reporting currency amount .
- The exchange rate and reporting currency amounts can be changed . If the exchange rate is changed , the reporting currency amount is recalculated by using the new rate .
- If a deprecation transaction type is entered in the Fixed asset journal , the reporting currency amounts will appear in the new columns . Those amounts can be changed .

title : Accounts payable invoice matching
Accounts payable invoice matching is the process of matching vendor invoice , purchase order , and product receipt information .
When matching documents , differences among these documents are called matching discrepancies . Matching discrepancies are compared with the tolerances that are specified . If a matching discrepancy exceeds the tolerance percentage or amount , match variance icons are displayed on the Vendor invoice page and on the Invoice history and matching details page .
You can use the following types of Accounts payable invoice matching :
- Invoice totals matching – Match the total amounts on the invoice to the total amounts on the purchase order . This type of invoice matching includes the least amount of detail , so you can use this option to set up controls that minimize the staff time that is required to review invoice matching information .
- Two-way matching – Match the price information on the invoice to the price information on the purchase order .
- Three-way matching – Match the price information on the invoice to the price information on the purchase order . Also match the quantity information on the invoice to the quantity information on the product receipts that are selected for the invoice .
&gt; Other forms of invoice validation can be done using vendor invoice policies .
Two-way matching and three-way matching always match price information by the unit price . You can also configure these matching policies to match price information by the price total .
# # Two-way , price totals matching
Price totals matching can be based on a percentage , an amount , or a percentage and amount .
Use two-way matching to help make sure that the variance between the price information on the purchase order and the invoice is within acceptable tolerances . You can compare price information for the net unit price of each item on the invoice . This is called net unit price matching .
# # Two-way , price totals matching and net unit price matching
You can use price totals matching and net unit price matching together . This example assumes the following configuration :
- The net unit price tolerance for the USB Drive item is 10 % .
The purchase order contains the following line .
&#124; Item number &#124; Quantity &#124; Unit price &#124; Net amount &#124;
&#124; USB Drive &#124; 1,000 &#124; 10.00 &#124; 10,000.00 &#124;
Use three-way matching to help make sure that the variance between the price information on the purchase order and the invoice is within acceptable tolerances , and to make sure that the quantity on the invoice matches the quantity on the corresponding product receipts .
&#124; Line field &#124; Invoice value &#124; Match status &#124;
&#124; Total product receipts matched &#124; 0.00 &#124; Failed &#124;
&gt; A variance percentage of 99,999,999,999.99 % means that the expected amount based on the purchase order is zero and the actual amount on the invoice is a positive value .
Charges matching is controlled for the legal entity by the Match charges toggle on the Accounts payable parameters page . You can set up variance tolerance percentages for charges on the Charges tolerances page .
&gt; Charges matching is performed only on charges codes for which the Compare purchase order and invoice values toggle is selected on the Charges code page .
Vendor invoices are often based on product receipts that represent actual shipments , instead of on purchase orders . Sometimes the invoiced amounts do not match the purchase order amounts , and sometimes the shipped quantities do not match the invoiced quantities . You can help manage this information in the following ways :
- View and approve quantity differences between the invoiced quantity on the invoice and the received quantity on the product receipt . If there is a difference , you can save the invoice and later match it to a different product receipt , or change the invoiced quantity to match the received quantity .

title : Depreciation effects with reversals
This article discusses potential implications of reversing a fixed asset transaction .
You can reverse fixed asset transactions , and the transactions that are associated with a fixed asset . You can also revoke a reversed transaction .
The following examples show the calculations that occur if you continue beyond the message without first reversing the depreciation transactions .
# # Example 1 : Depreciation is overstated
An asset is set up with a 5-year useful life and straight line depreciation ( 60 depreciation periods ) . In this example , depreciation is overstated .
# # # # Asset transaction history
&#124; January 1 &#124; Acquisition &#124; 59,000.00 &#124;
# # # # Reversal action
&#124; January 1 &#124; Acquisition adjustment reversal &#124; – 1,000.00 &#124;
Depreciation is overstated by 16.95 ( 1,000 - 983.05 ) .
# # Example 2 : Depreciation is understated

When a user rejects a document , the workflow process ends .
Sam can then resubmit the expense report . He can make changes first , or he can resubmit the original version . If Sam resubmits the expense report , the workflow process starts at the manual review task .
When a user delegates a task , the task is assigned to another user .
When a user requests a change to a document that was submitted , the document is sent back to the originator .
Sam can resubmit the expense report . He can make the requested changes first , or he can resubmit the original version . If Sam resubmits the expense report , a member of the work item queue must review the expense report and the receipts again .
The members of a work item queue can reassign documents that are in that queue to another queue .
Occasionally , a member of a work item queue might accept a task , but then decide that he or she can &apos;t complete the task . In this case , the person who accepted the task can release the document back to the work item queue .
# # Actions that a decision maker can perform
When a decision maker delegates a decision , the document is assigned to another user who must make the decision .
# # Actions that an approver can perform
When an approver approves a document , the document is assigned to the next user in the workflow , if there is a next user . If no additional processing is required , the workflow process ends .
When an approver rejects a document , the workflow process ends .
Sam can resubmit the expense report . He can make changes first , or he can resubmit the original version of the expense report . If Sam resubmits the expense report , the workflow process starts at the approval process .
When an approver delegates a document , the document is assigned to another user for approval .
For example , Sam has submitted an expense report for USD 12,000 , and this document is assigned to Frank . Frank delegates the expense report to Ann .
When an approver requests a change to a document , the document is sent back to the originator .
title : Analyze store performance
This report provides a snapshot of following summaries as part of store performance :

This topic provides information about the various types of product identifiers and explains how you can add product identifiers in your product data .
# # Unique product number / product ID
# # Item number and product dimensions
# # Product name and description
For product variants , the product name can be generated through a product nomenclature template . Because there is no requirement that product names be unique , you might find multiple products that have the same name .
# # Product and item search names
# # External product identifiers ( Customer and vendor identifiers )
You can maintain the external product identifiers by released product , released product variant , customer or customer group , or vendor or vendor group .
&#124; Field &#124; Corresponding customer information &#124; Corresponding vendor information &#124;
&#124; External item number &#124; The customer &apos;s item number &#124; The vendor &apos;s item number &#124;
&#124; Description &#124; The name that the customer associates with the item &#124; The name that the vendor associates with the item &#124;
&#124; External item text &#124; The customer &apos;s item description &#124; The vendor &apos;s item description &#124;
Unfortunately , there is no standard functionality that lets you search for products by external codes .
# # Data entities that are used to import and export product identifiers
&#124; Entity name &#124; Import identifiers &#124; Export identifiers &#124; Comments &#124;
# # # Product and item number sequences
In Finance and Operations , you can define two different number sequences :
- Settings of the * * Product number * * number sequence
- Settings of the * * Item number * * number sequence
- The mapping of the item number
- The mapping of the product number
The following table provides an overview of the results of import and manual creation when specific combinations of the number sequence and field mapping settings .
# # Product entity identifier ( Export all product identifiers )
This process assumes that product master data is primarily maintained in one central legal entity . ( However , this legal entity can be a virtual legal entity that is used only to maintain global master data . )
Follow these steps to configure the environment .

As part of the process to settle issue transactions with receipt transactions , you can also choose to have the general ledger updated to reflect the adjustments that have been made .
How often the inventory close process is run varies by company . However , transaction volume should help determine how often you decide to run inventory close . In general , most companies run inventory close as part of their month-end close and reconciliation procedures .
# # Inventory recalculation and the general ledger
If adjustments to inventory and the general ledger are required during a month or other inventory period , you can run inventory recalculation instead of inventory close . Inventory recalculation makes adjustments but doesn &apos;t make settlements to inventory transactions .
During inventory recalculation , on-hand inventory is adjusted , inventory transactions are adjusted , and inventory recalculations and inventory closes are run . These tasks affect any ledger account that is linked to the original inventory transaction .
After the update is completed , you can review the ledger voucher that is posted because of one of these tasks .
# # Effects of the inventory close process on the general ledger
- Inventory close isn &apos;t required if you use the Standard cost valuation method .
- Before you run the closing procedure , you can view a list of items that can &apos;t be settled during the update .
# # The inventory close log
After the inventory close process has been completed , a message in the message center might inform you that a unit cost price might be incorrect because a transaction could not be fully settled .
For each run of the closing procedure , the system indicates whether a log that contains the warnings is stored and can be viewed .
If you receive many warnings in the message , we recommend that you perform the following actions :
- Update receipts financially .
- Advance the closing date .
- Reevaluate the business procedures .
In some circumstances , you might not be able to do anything about the warnings . For example , if marking is used , and the marked purchase order has a financial date that is after the closing date , the closing date can &apos;t be changed .

title : Routes and operations
A simple route is sequential , and there is only one starting point for the route .
If you enable the more complex route networks in the Production control parameters , you can define routes that have multiple starting points and operations that can be run in parallel .
- Each operation can have only one successor operation , and the whole route must end in a single operation .
Both the primary operation and the secondary operations must have the same operation number ( 30 in the preceding illustration ) .
# # # Approval of routes
The following operational properties of an operation are maintained on the operation relation :
- Notes and instructions
Operation relations give you lots of flexibility when you define your routes . Additionally , the ability to define default properties helps reduce the amount of master data that you must maintain . However , this flexibility also means that you must be aware of the context that you modify an operation relation in .
# # # Modifying product-specific routes
You can also manually create an operation that is specific to a route and released product by using the * * Copy and edit relation * * function .
# # # Maintaining operation relations per route
# # # Maintaining operation relations per operation
In the Production control parameters , you can require that the validity period of a route version always be specified .
# # # Approval of route versions
# # # Activating the default route version
# # # Product change that uses case management
The product change case for the approval and activation of new or changed routes and route versions gives you an easy way to see an overview of the route version constraints . You can also approve and activate all routes that are related to a specific change in one operation and document the results in the product change case .
Depending on your business requirements , you might be able to reduce the effort that is required in order to maintain your process definitions .
# # # Making routes independent of resources
# # # Sharing routes across sites
# # # Standard operation relations
If you also express resource requirements in terms of skills and capabilities , and make your routes site-independent , you can help keep the ongoing maintenance of your business processes to a minimum .

title : Determine the BOM version
# Determine the BOM version
During a demand explosion , if an item has a default order type of Production , the planning engine finds a valid BOM version based on the site .
The site dimension is always known and is stated on the demand transaction . The following process is used to determine the BOM version to use :
- If there is a BOM version defined for the item at the demand site , the site-specific BOM is used .
- If there is no general BOM version to use , the demand explosion stops at this point .
A valid BOM version , whether site-specific or general , must meet the required criteria for date and quantity .
title : Retail sales price management
The following terms are used in this topic .
&#124; Term &#124; Definition , usage , and notes &#124;
In the retail industry , it &apos;s very typical to have different prices in different channels . The two primary factors that affect channel-specific prices are costs and local market conditions .
Loyalty programs can have multiple tiers , and the discounts can differ for different tiers . In this way , retailers can give frequent customers larger rewards without having to manually put those customers into a special group .
Loyalty programs have additional functionality besides prices and discounts . However , from the perspective of pricing and discounts , they are the same as affiliations .
# # # Best practices for price groups
Avoid setting price groups directly on a customer . Instead , use an affiliation . In this way , you can assign all types of prices and discounts to customers , not just sales price trade agreements .
The price and a discount can come from two different pricing priorities , because pricing priorities apply to prices and discounts independently .
To use pricing priority for prices , you must assign a pricing priority to a price group and then create a sales price trade agreement for that price group .
# # # Pricing priority example
Let &apos;s look at an example where store prices override other prices .
&#124; Product &#124; North East price &#124; NYC price &#124; Store price &#124;
In Microsoft Dynamics 365 , you can set the price of a product in three places :
- Directly on the product ( base price )
- In a sales price trade agreement
- In a price adjustment
If a retail channel &apos;s currency differs from the company currency , the base price in that retail channel is determined by using currency conversion on the price that is set on the product .
# # # Sales price trade agreement
&gt; A trade agreement price is always used before the base price .
# # Determining price for a product in a transaction
The retail pricing engine returns three prices for every product : the base price , the trade agreement price , and the active price .
# # Category price rules
The category price rules feature in Retail gives you an easy way to create new trade agreements for all the products in a category . This feature also lets you automatically find existing trade agreements for the products in the category and expire them .
To easily update the prices of various products from different product categories , you can use the supplemental product categories together with the category price rules .
# # Prices that include tax vs. prices that exclude tax
# # Differences between retail pricing and non-retail pricing
A single pricing engine is used to calculate retail prices across all channels : Call center , Retail store , and Online stores . This helps in enabling the unified commerce scenarios .
Retail pricing is designed to work with retail entities instead of non-retail entities . Specifically , it &apos;s designed to set prices by store , not by warehouse .
The retail pricing engine doesn &apos;t support the following pricing features :
- Setting price by using the Site and Warehouse storage dimensions
- Attribute-based pricing
In addition , * * only * * the retail pricing engine supports the following pricing features :
- The same price group can be used to control pricing and discounts .

title : Budget control overview
Expenditures can be recorded by using main accounts and financial dimensions . You can configure control of the overall expenditure to meet the organization ’ s policies and requirements by grouping combinations of financial dimensions and main accounts .
The following chart shows the place of budget control in the stages of a typical budget cycle .
You can configure budget control according to several factors :
# # # Budget cycle time span
The next steps in the configuration are completed on the various tabs on the * * Budget control configuration * * page .
Based on the financial dimensions that are enabled for the budget , you can use all the financial dimensions for budget control or a subset of them .
In addition , an organization ’ s culture , as it &apos;s related to budgeting and budgetary control , also helps define the configuration .
# # # Over budget permissions
# # # Budget funds available

This article provides information about job scheduling , which is a more detailed form of scheduling than operations scheduling . You can use job scheduling to schedule individual jobs or shop orders , and to control the manufacturing environment .
# # Tasks in the job scheduling process
The job scheduling process includes the following tasks :
- Split operations into jobs .
- Schedule jobs , based on the dates and times for the resources that are specified for the related operation .
- Calculate start times and end times for each job . You can use finite capacity to make sure that there are no overlapping times .
You can schedule jobs either forward or backward .
Job scheduling that is based on special properties requires that properties be specified for the operations on the production route . These properties must be fulfilled to reserve capacity .

title : Configuration keys and data entities
# Configuration keys and data entities
Before you use data entities to import or export data , we recommended that you first determine the impact of configuration keys on the data entities that you are planning to use .
# # # Configuration key assignments
Configuration keys can be assigned to one or all of the following artifacts .
The following table summarizes how configuration key values on the different artifacts that underlie an object change the expected behavior of the object .
&gt; If an entity has another entity as a data source then , the above semantics are applied in a recursive manner .
# # # Entity list refresh
# # # Data entity list page
# # # Using data entities
After understanding the full impact , if any , of configuration keys on the data entities that you would like to use , you can now proceed to using the data entities by adding them to data projects .
# # # Run time validations for configuration keys
Using the configuration key metadata built during entity refresh list , run time validations are performed in the following use cases .
- When a data entity is added to a job
- When user clicks &apos; validate &apos; on the entity list
- When the user loads a data package into a data project
- When the user loads a template into a data project
- When an existing data project is loaded
- When a template is loaded into a data project
- When the user generates mapping
- When the user maps fields in the mapping UI
- When the user adds only &apos; importable fields&apos;
# # # Managing configuration key changes
# # Allow managers to update time off requests

# # Results of posting a reversal
When you post a check reversal , the following events occur :
- The reversal voucher is posted against the bank account that the check was issued from , to increase the bank account balance .
- The voucher is posted to General ledger .
- The original payment from the invoice that the payment was settled against is unapplied ( the settlement is reversed ) .
If the check that was reversed was issued for a customer refund , the following events also occur :
title : Straight line service life depreciation
This article gives an overview of the Straight line service life method of depreciation .
When you set up a fixed asset depreciation profile and select Straight line service life in the Method field in the Depreciation profiles page , the assets that have this depreciation profile assigned to them are depreciated based on the total service life of the asset . This generally is the same depreciation amount in each depreciation period .
The difference in the depreciation amount that is calculated between straight line service life remaining and straight line service life is when there is an adjustment posted to the asset .
To set up straight line service life depreciation , you must also select options in the Depreciation year and Period frequency fields in the Depreciation profiles page .
You can select either Calendar or Fiscal in the Depreciation year field in the Depreciation profiles page . The selection defines the options that are available in the Period frequency field . The default option is Calendar .
If you select Calendar , a year of January 1 to December 31 is assumed , even if you have defined the fiscal calendar differently .
If you select Calendar , the following options are available in the Period frequency field , which defines the depreciation accrual posting dates and amounts throughout the calendar year :
- Yearly posts an amount on December 31 .
- Monthly posts a monthly amount at the end of each calendar month .
- Half-Yearly posts a half-yearly amount at the end of each calendar half year ( June 30 and December 31 ) .
- Daily posts the depreciation amount for the daily depreciation method using one transaction for each day .
If you select Fiscal , the following options are available in the Period frequency field :
- Yearly posts the total amount of the depreciation that is calculated for the fiscal year as one amount on the last day of the fiscal year .
# # Example : Straight line depreciation of an unchanged fixed asset
Suppose that a fixed asset has the following characteristics .
&#124; Salvage value &#124; 1,000 &#124;
&#124; Yearly depreciation &#124; 2,000 &#124;
You get the same depreciation amount each year . ( Acquisition cost - Salvage value ) / Service life years
&#124; Period &#124; Calculation of yearly depreciation amount &#124; Net book value at the end of the year &#124;
Suppose that you add an acquisition adjustment of 4,000 in year 2 to the same fixed asset .
\ * Because the remaining amount is less than the depreciation amount , only the remaining amount minus the salvage value is taken .
Before synchronization of project tasks can occur , you must synchronize project contracts and projects .
&#124; Project Tasks &#124; Integration entity for project task &#124;
- You have resource-specific records in a project task .
If you must use Power Query , follow this guideline :
title : Depreciation methods and conventions
You can select various depreciation methods and conventions . The purpose of the methods is to allocate the depreciable value of the fixed asset into fiscal periods . The depreciable value of the fixed asset is the acquisition price , reduced by a scrap value , if any .
You can select from the following depreciation conventions .
- Full month
- Mid quarter
- Mid month ( 1st of month )
- Mid month ( 15th of month )
- Half year ( start of year )
- Half year ( next year )
You can select from the following depreciation methods .
- Straight line service life
- Straight line life remaining

&gt; Wondering about upcoming and recently released capabilities in any of our business apps or platform ?
In an omni-channel retail world , many retailers provide the option of customer orders , or special orders , to meet various product and fulfillment requirements . Here are some typical scenarios :
- A customer wants products to be delivered to a specific address on a specific date .
- A customer wants to pick up products from a store or location that differs from the store or location where the customer purchased those products .
- A customer wants someone else to pick up products that the customer purchased .
Retailers also use customer orders to minimize lost sales that stock outages might otherwise cause , because the merchandise can be delivered or picked up at a different time or place .
# # Set up customer orders
Here are some of the parameters that can be set on the * * Retail parameters * * page to define how customer orders are fulfilled :

title : Simulate cost changes by using a costing version for planned costs
# Simulate cost changes by using a costing version for planned costs
This article explains how you can simulate the effects of cost changes on a manufactured item ’ s calculated costs by using a separate costing version for planned costs .
# # Guidelines for defining the simulation costing version
Use the following guidelines when you define the costing version for simulations :
- Allow the entry of cost records . Don &apos;t block the entry of pending costs .
- Allow the entry of cost records for all sites . If you specify a site , you will limit the entry of cost records to that site .
- Prevent the activation of pending costs . Only pending costs must be entered for cost records in the simulation costing version .
- Don &apos;t enter a &quot; from &quot; date . A calculation date will be entered for each BOM calculation that uses the simulation costing version .

# Track running average cost per inventory dimension
An inventory dimension group is attached to every inventory item . Therefore , the running average cost price of an item is calculated based on the selected inventory dimensions that are being tracked financially .
If the storage dimension group that is attached to the item is financially tracked by warehouse , the running average cost price is calculated per warehouse . The following purchase orders have been invoiced :
title : Retail peripherals
This topic explains the concepts that are related to retail peripherals . It describes the various ways that peripherals can be connected to the point of sale ( POS ) and the components that are responsible for managing the connection with the POS .
Cloud POS is a browser-based version of the Modern POS program that can be accessed in a web browser .
POS peripherals are typically divided into classes . This section describes and gives an overview of the devices that Modern POS supports .
Personal identification number ( PIN ) pads are supported through OPOS , but they must be managed via a payment connector .
- When Windows drivers are used , images are rendered before printing occurs . Therefore , printing tends to be slower than it is on printers that use OPOS controls .
- Devices that are connected through the printer ( “ daisy-chained ” ) might not work correctly when Windows drivers are used . For example , the cash drawer might not open , or the slip printer might not word as you expect .
- OPOS also supports a more extensive set of variables that are specific to retail receipt printers , such as paper cutting or slip printing .
# # Hardware station deployment options
The network designation for devices in the hardware profile enables cash drawers , receipt printers , and payment terminals to be connected via a network connection .
# # # Hardware station installation
# # # OPOS device setup and configuration
Within the ServiceOPOS registry location , configured devices are organized according to the OPOS device class . Multiple device drivers are saved .
# # Supported scenarios by hardware station type
# # # Client support – IPC hardware station vs. IIS hardware station
The following table shows the topologies and deployment scenarios that are supported .
&#124; Client &#124; IPC hardware station &#124; IIS hardware station &#124;
&#124; Cloud POS &#124; No &#124; Yes &#124;
# # Supported device types by hardware station type
1 . Create a hardware profile where all the required peripherals are configured .
2 . Map the hardware profile to the POS register .
This configuration can be used for all Modern POS clients that have a hardware station that is used exclusively by one POS register . To set up this configuration , follow these steps .
12 . On the hardware station management page , set the option to turn on the hardware station .
15 . On the hardware station selection page , click the recently selected hardware station to make it active .
This configuration can be used for all Modern POS clients that share hardware stations with other devices . To set up this configuration , follow these steps .
1 . Create a hardware profile where the required peripherals are configured .
3 . On the shared hardware station , set the following properties :
13 . On the hardware station management page , set the option to turn on the hardware station .
- No additional network ports should be open , unless they are required for known , specified reasons .
- Cross-origin resource sharing must be disabled and must specify the allowed origins that are accepted .
- Only trusted certificate authorities should be used to obtain certificates that will be used on computers that run the hardware station .
# # # IPC ( built-in ) hardware station
The following peripherals were tested by using the IPC hardware station that is built into Modern POS for Windows .
# # # # Bar code scanner
# # # # PIN pad
# # # # Payment terminal
# # # # Cash drawer
# # # # Line display
# # # # Signature capture
# # # Dedicated IIS hardware station
# # # Shared IIS hardware station
- On the computer that runs the hardware station , the port that will be used by the hardware station is opened in the firewall .
- The hardware station has correctly installed merchant account information through the Install merchant information tool that runs at the end of the hardware station installer .
# # # Modern POS can ’ t detect the hardware station in its list for selection
- The hardware station hasn ’ t been set up correctly in headquarters . Use the steps earlier in this topic to verify that the hardware station profile and the hardware station are correctly entered .
- The jobs haven ’ t been run to update the channel configuration . In this case , run the 1070 job for channel configuration .
# # # Modern POS doesn &apos;t reflect new cash drawer settings
- If the retail peripheral is shared with multiple POS devices , make sure that it belongs to one of the following categories :
If the peripheral doesn &apos;t belong to one of these categories , the hardware station isn &apos;t designed to enable the peripheral to be shared among multiple POS devices .

# Electronic reporting ( ER )
The ER engine has the following capabilities :
# # # # Data model components
A data model component is an abstract representation of a data structure . It &apos;s used to describe a specific business domain area with enough detail to satisfy the reporting requirements for that domain . A data model component consists of the following parts :
- A data model , as a set of domain-specific business entities and a hierarchically structured definition of relations between those entities .
- Company \ &gt; Vendor \ &gt; Payment transactions of the AP domain
- Customer \ &gt; Company \ &gt; Payment transactions of the AR domain
Note that business entities such as company and payment transactions are designed one time . Different mappings then reuse them .
A model mapping that supports outgoing electronic documents has the following capabilities :
A model mapping that supports incoming electronic documents has the following capabilities :
# # # # Format components for outgoing electronic documents
A format component is the scheme of the reporting output that will be generated at run time . A scheme consists of the following elements :
- A format that defines the structure and content of the outgoing electronic document that is generated at run time .
- Data sources , as a set of user input parameters and a domain-specific data model that uses a selected model mapping .
A format component supports the following functions :
- Creation of multiple files separately and encapsulation of those files into zip files .
A format component lets you attach specific files that can be used in the reporting output :
- Excel workbooks that contain a worksheet that can be used as a template for output in the OPENXML worksheet format
- Word files that contain a document that can be used as a template for output in the Microsoft Word document format
- Other files that can be incorporated into the format &apos;s output as predefined files
The following illustration shows how the data flows for these formats .
To run a single ER format configuration and generate an outgoing electronic document , you must identify the mapping of the format configuration .
# # # # Format components for incoming electronic documents
A format component is the scheme of the incoming document that is imported at run time . A scheme consists of the following elements :
Versioning is supported for ER components . The following workflow is provided to manage changes in ER components :
- The component can be serialized in XML format and exported as a file in XML format .
# # # # Component date effectivity
# # # # Component access
Each model configuration contains a data model component . A new format configuration can be derived from a specific data model configuration . In the configuration tree , the format configuration that is created appears as a child of the original data model configuration .
An ER configuration is shared for Finance and Operations companies .

- Should party records be deleted from the address book when the role record is deleted ? For example , if a customer record is deleted , should the party record also be deleted ?
- If the DUNS number is included in a party record , should the uniqueness of the number be checked ?
- Which user roles should have access to the private addresses and contact information of party records ?
- How many additional address books will you create ?
# # # Address book security
- Which teams should have access to each new address book that you will create ?
# Formula designer in Electronic reporting ( ER )
ER supports the formula designer . Therefore , at design time , you can configure expressions that can be used for the following tasks at runtime :
You can open the * * Formula designer * * page when you perform any of the following actions :
- Bind data source items to data model components .
- Bind data source items to format components .
- Complete maintenance of calculated fields that are part of data sources .
- Define the visibility conditions for user input parameters .
- Design a format &apos;s transformations .
- Define the enabling conditions for the format &apos;s components .
- Define the file names for the format &apos;s FILE components .
- Define the conditions for process control validations .
- Define the message text for process control validations .
- From Finance and Operations data sources and runtime parameters to an ER data model
- From an ER data model to an ER format
# # # Process flow control
The ER formula designer can be used to define expressions that control the process flow of generating electronic documents . You can perform the following tasks :
- Define conditions that determine when a document creation process must be stopped .
- Specify expressions that either create messages for the user about stopped processes or throw execution log messages about the continuing process of report generation .
- Specify the file names of generating electronic documents , and control the conditions of their creation .
Each rule of the process flow control is designed as an individual validation . The following illustration shows a validation of this type . Here is an explanation of the configuration in this example :
- The validation returns an error message that includes the text of Finance and Operations label SYS70894 in the user &apos;s preferred language .
The ER formula designer can also be used to generate a file name for a generating electronic document and control the file creation process . The following illustration shows the design of a process flow control of this type . Here is an explanation of the configuration in this example :
- The output creates a zip file that contains one file in XML format for every batch that was created .
- An expression returns a file name for generating electronic documents by concatenating the file name and the file name extension . For the second batch and all subsequent batches , the file name contains the batch ID as a suffix .
ER expressions can contain any or all of the following elements :
The following table shows the arithmetic operators that you can use to do basic mathematical operations , such as addition , subtraction , multiplication , and division .
The following table shows the comparison operators that are supported . You can use these operators to compare two values .
# # # # # Operator precedence
If the methods of Finance and Operations data sources have parameters , the following syntax is used to call those methods :
- Quotation marks aren &apos;t required when a method name contains only alphanumeric symbols . However , they are required for a method of a table if the name includes brackets .
You can limit the way that values are passed to the parameters of this type of method :
- Only constants can be passed to methods of this type . The values of the constants are defined at design time .
The following tables describe the data manipulation functions that you can use to design ER data models and ER reports . The list of functions isn &apos;t fixed . Developers can extend it . To see the list of functions that you can use , open the functions pane in the ER formula designer .

There are three types of allocation bases in Cost accounting :
- Predefined dimension member allocation bases
The predefined dimension member allocation bases are created automatically when a dimension member of one the following types is created :
- Statistical dimension members
- Cost element dimension members
&gt; The predefined dimension member allocation bases that are based on a cost element dimension member consider the values only from the data source provider , such as the general ledger or budget .
In the general ledger , the chart of account is defined as follows .
&#124; Chart of account &#124; Main account &#124; Description &#124; Main account type &#124;
Define a cost element dimension , and configure the data connector . After the data is imported , the following entries are created in Cost accounting .
* * Cost element dimension members * *
* * Predefined dimension member allocation bases * *
&#124; Name &#124; Description &#124; Cost element dimension &#124;
In the general ledger , the following entries have been posted :
- The entries that show the Salaries main account come from the Payroll system and are posted to cost centers .
- The expense for employee insurance is manually posted to a default cost center .
After the general ledger source data is processed , the following entries are created in Cost accounting .
&#124; Cost object dimension hierarchy node &#124; Cost element dimension hierarchy node &#124; Cost behavior &#124; Allocation base &#124;
After cost element 10001 ( Salaries ) is applied as the allocation base , the result of the overhead calculation is as follows .
* * Cost object balance journal entries * *
Statistical dimension members can be used as allocation bases to define policies or report non-monetary consumption by cost objects . You can manually create statistical dimension members or import them from a file by using the Data management import / export tool .
When a statistical dimension member is saved , a corresponding record is created in the predefined dimension member allocation bases .
Statistical measures can come from various sources :
- Electricity consumption can be measured by meters that are installed in different areas of the company .
&#124; Name &#124; Cost center &#124; Description &#124; Worker type &#124;
&gt; All the tables that contain financial dimensions can be used as sources for statistical measures .
Cost accounting supports a collection of statistical measures by using the following data connections :
- Data management import / export tool
- Statistical measures
* * Statistical measure provider templates * *
After the statistical measure source data is processed , the following entries will be created in Cost accounting .
Here is an example of a cost distribution rule if the FTE ’ s predefined dimension member allocation basis is assigned as the allocation base in it .
&#124; Cost object &#124; Description &#124; Magnitude &#124; Allocation factor &#124;
&#124; Accounting date &#124; Dimension member &#124; Magnitude &#124; Source identifier &#124;
Here is an example of a cost distribution rule if the Electricity predefined dimension member allocation basis is assigned as the allocation base in it .
# # Hierarchy allocation bases
Cost accountants can manually create the hierarchy allocation bases by applying a cost object dimension hierarchy node to an existing allocation base . In this way , you can limit the range of the original predefined dimension member allocation basis . One predefined dimension member allocation basis can be used to create several hierarchy allocation bases . Ranges can be maintained in the cost object dimension hierarchy that is associated with the hierarchy allocation bases .
# # # Example : Hierarchy allocation bases that are based on full-time employees in the organization
Here is an example of a cost object dimension hierarchy that can be created to describe a simplified organization .
The FTE ’ s predefined dimension member allocation basis that was created in the previous section holds the following entries .
&#124; Name &#124; Allocation base &#124; Cost object dimension hierarchy &#124; Cost object dimension hierarchy node &#124;
Here is an example of a cost distribution rule if the Number of FTEs in CFO hierarchy allocation basis is assigned as the allocation base in it .
# # Formula allocation bases
Formula allocation bases let you define advanced formulas to achieve the correct allocation basis . You can manually create formula allocation bases .
When you create a formula allocation base , you select which statistical dimension and cost element dimension should be the basis for the formula . All allocation bases that come from the previously selected dimensions can be used in a formula allocation base .
&gt; Previously defined formula allocation bases can be used to define a new formula allocation base .
In formula allocation base factors , you create an alias , and associate it with either an allocation base or a constant . The aliases are then used to define the formula .
You can use the following operators to define your formula .
# # # Example 1 : A simple formula
Electricity bills often consist of two parts :
- A fixed fee for being connected to grid
- A cost that is associated with consumption per kWh
The Electricity predefined dimension member allocation basis has already been defined and holds these values .
If the fixed fee must now be evenly spread over cost objects that consume electricity , you have two options for allocating the costs :
- Create a new predefined allocation base , Electricity fixed , and then apply a statistical measure of 1.00 for each cost object that consumed electricity .
&#124; Name &#124; Cost element dimension &#124; Statistical dimension &#124; Formula &#124;
Note that 0 ( zero ) isn &apos;t supported as a constant .
A Preview function lets you validate the formula allocation base that is created , based on statistical entries in the system .
Here is an example of a cost distribution rule if the Electricity formula allocation base is assigned as the allocation base in it .
* * Cost object magnitude allocation factor * *
# # # Example 2 : An advanced formula
For this example , the cost of electricity should not just follow the actual electricity that is consumed in kWh . Management wants to incorporate incentive for lowering electricity usage .
A new formula allocation base , Electricity usage , is created .
Here is an example of a cost distribution rule if the Electricity fixed formula allocation base is assigned as the allocation base in it .

title : Generate printable FTI forms
# # Create customized configurations for FTI printable forms
As part of your customized solution for printable FTI forms , you must create a set of ER configurations .
# # # Configure the ER data model
# # # Configure the ER model mapping
The mapping must contain the following data sources :
- It must refer to the CustInvoiceJour application table .
- It &apos;s used at runtime to pass from the application to the ER model mapping details of the print management settings for the ER format that is running .
# # # Configure the ER format
In your application instance , you must have the ER format configuration that will be used to generate FTI forms .
3 . Select the document level to specify the scope of invoices for processing .
4 . Select the ER format for the specified document level .
FTI forms are generated in the ER framework in the same way that SSRS reports are generated .
To generate FTI forms , you can select invoices either by range or by selection .
The ER framework currently supports the following destinations for generated documents :
&gt; You can &apos;t send the FTI forms that are generated directly to the printer , because direct printing that uses the Dynamics Printer Routing Agent isn &apos;t currently supported .
# # Download sample ER configurations to generate printable FTI forms
&gt; These configurations have been created as samples to help clarify possible scenarios . The future of these configurations depends on the results of this evaluation and any feedback that is received .
# # # Features that are implemented in the sample ER format
In the sample ER format configuration , an Excel file is used as a template to generate FTI forms .
Currently , this sample ER format supports the following features to generate FTI forms :
- FTI forms are generated for both original invoices that have been posted and original invoices that haven &apos;t yet been posted . Corrected invoices and credit notes aren &apos;t supported .
- FTI forms are generated in the invoice language . The format of values and dates in the generated forms is based on the settings of the user &apos;s client locale .
- Generated invoices show data unavailability notifications if there are no lines in the invoices that are processed .
- The generated invoice lines and invoice totals sections show the default invoice &apos;s monetary details in the invoice registration currency .
- Generated invoice forms include notes for the customer FTI form and the processing invoice language when they have been configured in the AR form notes list .
- The totals section of generated invoice forms includes any cash discount information that is available .
- The payment schedule section of generated invoice forms includes any payment schedule details that are available .
- The markup section of generated invoice forms includes any charges transactions that are available .
- Generated invoices show any prepayment details that are available for posted invoices .
- Generated invoice forms can be sent to an invoice customer as an email attachment . The appropriate ER file destination should be configured for the ER format that is being used .
# # # Country / region-specific features
The Enterprise register term is put on the header of the generated invoice form when the invoice is processed for a legal entity that is configured in the following manner :
- The special regime for the cash accounting method is enabled on the invoice processing date .
In addition to the generated invoice form , Giro money transfer slips can be generated as follows :
&gt; The sample ER format has been configured to optionally generate the Giro money transfer slips in the separate worksheet .
&gt; You must first install the font that is used to generate the bar code on the local machine where the generated invoice form in Excel format will be previewed .

title : Bills of materials and formulas
# Bills of materials and formulas
This topic provides information about bills of materials ( BOMs ) and formulas , which are a central part of the definition of products and product variants . BOMs and formulas specify the required materials or ingredients for a specific product . Formulas also specify the co-products and by-products that are received in a specific production context .
When it &apos;s combined with a route or production flow that describes the operations and resources that are required in order to build a product , the BOM forms the foundation for calculating the estimated cost of the product .
A BOM is an individual entity that is described by the following information :
- The BOM lines that describe the components and ingredients
- The BOM versions , which define the product and period that the BOM can be used for
A single BOM describes a single level that is identified by a unique ID . Components might have their own BOMs that are referenced by BOM versions . You can display and edit the complete hierarchy of BOMs for a specific product in the BOM designer .
# # # Formulas , co-products , and by-products
# # # BOMs in the product lifecycle
In the product lifecycle , many types of BOM might be created for various reasons :
# # # Approval of BOMs and formulas
Each BOM and formula can be separately approved or unapproved . Typically , approval of a BOM or formula occurs when the first relevant BOM version is approved . However , in some business scenarios , these approvals might be different steps in the process and might involve different process owners .
Note that , if a BOM is unapproved , all related BOM versions are also unapproved .
# # BOM and formula versions
# # # Approval of BOM and formula versions
# # # Activation of the default BOM or formula version
# # # Product change with case management
The product change case for approval and activation of new or changed BOMs and BOM versions provides an easy way to see an overview of the BOM version constraints . You can also approve and activate all BOMs and formulas that are related to a specific change for one activation date .
# # # Alternative BOM versions
# # BOM and formula lines
A BOM line is created for each material , service , or ingredient . The line defines the planned consumption of the specified product variant and also defines the various attributes that are related to the planned consumption .

# # # POS platform and form factor considerations
Retail supports the following POS options :
- The user interface ( UI ) is consistent , regardless of the platform or form factor .
- Customizations and extensions can easily be used across platforms and form factors . Because the core application code is shared , most customizations can be implemented one time instead of multiple times .
# # # MPOS vs. CPOS
Although MPOS and CPOS are largely the same , there are some important differences that you must understand .
MPOS on a Windows , iOS , or Android device is an application that is packaged , installed , and serviced on that device .
# # # Store deployment considerations
In addition to a platform and form factor , retailers must also choose a deployment option at the store . The following table shows the configurations that are available for each POS option .
&#124; POS application &#124; Retail server &#124; Available offline &#124;
# # # # Retail server
# # # # Offline mode
# # # POS peripheral / hardware considerations
Consider the following information as you plan your POS implementation in your retail stores :
- Use MPOS in Windows , and enable offline mode .
- Deploy an on-premises RSSU .

title : Three-way matching policies
This topic provides examples of three-way matching .
The invoice matching policies in this example help people in the following roles meet these goals :
- Ken sets the matching policy at the legal entity level to Three-way matching .
- For items that require three-way matching , the quantity on the invoice line matches the quantity that was received . The received quantity is indicated on the product receipt that is matched to the invoice .
The paper invoice from Contoso contains the following information .
&#124; Item &#124; Quantity &#124; Unit price &#124; Net amount &#124;
In Finance and Operations , the invoice line includes the following information .
Because this line passes the invoice matching process , the invoice can be posted .
# # Example : Three-way matching for item and vendor combinations
- Ken sets the matching policy at the legal entity level to Two-way matching .
Note the following items :
- For the PH2500 – Computer line , the Product receipt quantity match column has a warning icon because the invoice line is not matched to a product receipt .
- For the USB Drive line , the Product receipt quantity match column is blank because two-way matching does not match invoice line and product receipt line quantities .

title : Reason codes for inventory counting
# Reason codes for inventory counting
Reason codes let you analyze the results of a counting process and any discrepancies that occur during that process . You can specify the reason for doing the count , such as a broken pallet or a stock adjustment that is based on inventory samples .
Before you set up the system , we recommend that you define a strategy for working with reason codes . For example , try to answer the following questions :
- Should reason codes be mandatory on warehouses ?
- Should reason codes be mandatory or optional on some items ?
- How many reason codes do you require ?
- How should users of barcode scanners use reason codes ? Should the reason codes be preselected , mandatory , or not editable ?
- Do warehouse workers require different reason code behavior on mobile scanners ? If the answer is yes , you can create more menu items and assign them to different people .
# # Where reason codes apply
You can create multiple reason code policies , and each reason code policy can have two counting reason code policies . The counting reason code policies can be used at the warehouse level or the item level .
# # Set up reason code policies
- Cycle Count ( mobile device )
- Spot Count ( mobile device )
- Threshold Count ( mobile device )
- Adjustment In ( mobile device )
- Adjustment Out ( mobile device )
- Counting Journal ( rich client )
# # # Set up reason codes for products
# # # Use reason codes in counting journals
In a counting journal , you can add reason codes for counts of the following types :
- Adjustment In
- Adjustment Out
Reason codes are added to the journal lines in counting journals of the * * Counting journal * * type .
# # # View the counting history as it &apos;s recorded by reason codes
# # # Configure reason codes for mobile device menu items
You can configure reason codes for any type of count on a mobile device menu item . The configuration of the mobile device menu item includes the following information :
- Whether the reason code is shown to the mobile device worker during counting .
- The default reason code that is shown on a mobile device menu item .
- Whether the user can edit the reason code .
# # # Set up reason codes on a mobile device
Before a count is approved , the user can change the reason code that is associated with the count . When the count is approved , the reason code is entered on the counting journal lines .
# # # Modify cycle count approvals
# # # Modify the mobile device menu item for Adjustment in and Adjustment out
- Default counting reason code
- Display counting reason code
- Edit counting reason code

title : Expression constraints and table constraints in product configuration models
# Expression constraints and table constraints in product configuration models
# # What are expression constraints ?
# # What are table constraints ?
# # # Example of a table constraint
# # What syntax should be used to write constraints ?
# # Should I use table constraints or expression constraints ?
When you configure a product by using the following constraint setups , these combinations are allowed :
- A product in the color Black , and in size 30 or 50
- A product in the color Red and in size 20
# # # Table constraint setup
# # # Expression constraint setup
# # Should I use operators or infix notation when I write expression constraints ?
# # What operators and infix notation can I use when I write expression constraints ?
The following tables list the operators and infix notation that you can use when you write an expression constraint for a component in a product configuration model . The examples in the first table show how to write an expression by using either infix notation or operators .
The examples in the next table show how to write infix notation .
# # Why aren &apos;t my expression constraints validated correctly ?

This article provides information about order promising . Order promising helps you reliably promise delivery dates to your customers and gives you flexibility so that you can meet those dates .
Order promising calculates the earliest ship and receipt dates , and is based on the delivery date control method and transport days . You can select among four delivery date control methods :
ATP is calculated by using the following formula :
When there are no more issues or receipts to consider , the ATP quantity for the following dates is the same as the latest calculated ATP quantity .
Therefore , the ship date is set to 10 days from now , based on the ATP calculation . Therefore , you tell the customer that the requested quantity can be delivered 10 days from now .
title : System-defined and user-defined table constraints
# System-defined and user-defined table constraints
This article explains the two types of table constraints for components in a product configuration model - user-defined and system-defined . Table constraints represent matrices of the allowed attribute combinations , where each row defines one set of possible attribute values .
Table constraints represent matrices of the combinations of attributes that are allowed for components in a product configuration model . Each row in the table defines one set of possible attribute values . You can declare two types of constraints in a product configuration model :
This article describes user-defined and system-defined table constraints for components in a product configuration model .
&#124; Cabinet finish &#124; Front grill &#124;
User-defined table constraints are defined by static table input that works the same way as an expression constraint . When you use a user-defined table constraint , the advantage is that tables are often easier to create , understand , and maintain than long expression constraints .

# Deactivate a production flow version
When an active production flow version is no longer needed , it can be deactivated . You should only use this option if all kanban rules and activities have ended and will not be activated again . Note that the expiry date of all kanban rules related to this production flow version will be updated with the current date and time .
To modify an active production flow version , consider setting an expiry date for the active version and create a new version . This will allow you to continue your production operations while preparing the new version and related kanban rules .
To expire an active production flow version , you need to set an expiry date . In that sense , deactivation is more like an exception than a rule .
For this procedure you need a production flow with a version that can be deactivated . Do not try this in a production environment unless you are 100 % positive that the version is fully obsolete .
# # Deactivate a production flow version
* Do not proceed if you are not 100 % positive that this production flow version is obsolete . Clicking Ok will expire all active kanban rules and put an immediate stop to all production and replenishment activities of this production flow version .

title : Statistical dimension members and statistical measure provider templates
# Statistical dimension members and statistical measure provider templates
A statistical dimension and its members are used to register and control non-monetary entries in Cost accounting . Statistical dimension members can be used for two purposes :
- As an allocation base in policies such as cost distribution or cost allocation
- For reporting of non-monetary consumption
A statistical dimension has a unique name and a set of unique dimension members . The statistical dimension is assigned to a Cost accounting ledger ID . This relationship ties all corresponding statistical dimension members to the Cost accounting ledger . Therefore , all statistical entries will be created in the context of the Cost accounting ledger .
Here is an example of a statistical dimension .
&#124; Name &#124; Data connector for dimension members &#124;
&#124; Shared Statistical elements &#124; Imported dimension members &#124;
Here is an example of a statistical dimension that has been assigned to a Cost accounting ledger .
A statistical dimension member represents an entity that you want to register non-monetary measures for . These measures can be used either as an allocation base or just to report non-monetary values .
Statistical dimension members can be created manually . Alternatively , they can be imported from a file by using the Data management import / export tool .
A statistical dimension member automatically becomes a predefined allocation base . It can be used as an allocation base in policies or as input in other types of allocation bases .
Here are some examples of typical statistical dimension members .
&#124; Statistical dimension name &#124; Statistical elements &#124; Description &#124; Unit &#124;
&#124; Shared Statistical elements &#124; FTE &#124; Full time employees &#124; Ea . &#124;
&#124; Shared Statistical elements &#124; Pack CC &#124; Packaging Cost center &#124; Hrs . &#124;
The definition of a statistical measure provider template is generic and can be reused in multiple statistical dimension members .
&gt; All tables that contain financial dimensions can be used as sources for statistical measures .
The count of employees per cost center is a statistical measure that can be used for various purposes that provide managerial insight :
- A statistical reporting measure by cost center
- An allocation base for various types of expenses
- Internal cost rates by cost center :
- Cost by employee
- Revenue by employee
Here is an example of employees in the HcmEmployment table .
# # Using the Count function
For example , a statistical measure provider template can be set up as follows .
You can also add one or more ranges to narrow the measures from the source table .
&#124; Name &#124; Data connector &#124; Statistical dimension member &#124;
&#124; Statistical template name &#124;
After the source data for the statistical measure is processed , the following statistical entries are created in Cost accounting .
* * Statistical entry transfer journal entries * *
If the FTEs predefined dimension member allocation basis is assigned as an allocation base in a cost distribution rule , the cost will be distributed by using the following allocation factor .
# # Using the Sum function
The ProdRouteTrans table holds all production labor transactions per legal entity DataAreadID .
Here is an example of the ProdRouteTrans table .
You can also add ranges to narrow the measures from the source table .
The system recognizes that ProdRouteTrans is a table where each record belongs to a separate legal entity . Therefore , you will be asked to select the legal entity that transactions should be imported from .
&#124; Statistical template name &#124; Legal entity &#124;
If the Pack CC predefined dimension member allocation basis is assigned as an allocation base in a cost distribution rule , the cost will be distributed by using the following allocation factor .
&#124; Cost object &#124; Magnitude &#124; Allocation factor &#124;
You can import statistical measures into Cost accounting by using the Data management import / export tool .
The data entity that is used for the import is named Imported statistical measures .
The consumption of electricity is recorded in Microsoft Excel by using the predefined format of the data entity . Here is an example .
&#124; Electricity &#124; Imported statistical measures &#124; Electricity &#124;
If the Electricity predefined dimension member allocation basis is assigned as an allocation base in a cost distribution rule , the cost will be distributed by using the following allocation factor .
This topic explains the various types of financial dimensions and how they are set up .
Before you set up financial dimensions as legal entities , evaluate your business processes in the following areas to determine whether this setup will work for your organization :
- Sales and purchases between financial dimensions and legal entities
- Sales tax calculation and reporting
Here are some of the limitations :
- You can use sales tax functionality only with legal entities , not with financial dimensions .
- Some reports don &apos;t include financial dimensions . Therefore , to report by financial dimension , you might have to modify the reports .
To help maintain referential integrity of the data , financial dimensions can rarely be deleted . If you try to delete a financial dimension , the following criteria are evaluated :
- Has the financial dimension been used on any posted or unposted transactions , or in any type of dimension value combination ?
- Is the financial dimension used in any active account structure , advanced rule structure , or financial dimension set ?
- Is the financial dimension part of a default financial dimension integration format ?
- Has the financial dimension been set up as a default dimension ?
If any of the criteria are met , you can &apos;t delete the financial dimension .
If records already exist for the dimension , the master records are updated when you turn the feature on . However , existing documents and transactions aren &apos;t updated .
You can set up derived values on the dimensions page .
2 . Add the segments that should be derived . Each segment appears as a column .
Derived dimensions with this setting do not automatically replace the existing default dimensions values when dimension values are defaulted . Dimension values will only be overridden when you enter a new dimension value on a page and there are existing derived values for that dimension on the page .
# # # Preventing changes with derived dimensions
In all cases , the account value and all dimensions values will still be validated against the account structures after the derived dimensions values have been applied . If you use derived dimensions and they fail validation when used on a page , you must change the derived dimensions values on the derived dimensions page before you can use them in transactions .
# # # Derived dimensions and entities
You can set up the derived dimensions segments and values by using entities .
- The Derived dimensions entity sets up the driving dimensions and the segments that are used for those dimensions .
- The Derived dimensions value entity lets you import the values that should be derived for each driving dimension .
When you use an entity to import data , if that entity imports dimensions , the derived dimension rules are applied during the import unless the entity specifically overrides those dimensions .

The following comparison chart will help differentiate the two options :
- Income statement by region
- Income statement actual vs. budget
- 12-month trend income statement
- Expenses three-year trend
- Expenses by vendor
- Sales by customer
By default , when you first open workspaces , the active legal entity is used as the report-level filter . Depending on their security , users might be able to add other legal entities or change the default legal entity that is selected in the filter .
The * * Balance by bank account * * visual uses amounts in the bank accounts &apos; currency .
The following dimensions are used on the default reports . None of these dimensions are financial dimensions .
- State / province
To see the transaction details behind the summarized balances , you can select some amounts to drill back into Financial and Operations .
The following filters from the financial statements are sent to the ASE , so that the ASE shows the transactions that are aggregated :
Required fields for filtering :
- Legal entity
- Fiscal calendar
- Main account ID
Optional fields for filtering :
Currently , the financial statements don &apos;t support the organizational hierarchies , which let you aggregate data .
The financial statement visuals have a limit on the number of rows that can be shown . Currently , the limit is set to 30,000 . If you exceed this limit , the visual will have a warning symbol to notify you about this situation .
If the maximum is exceeded , the totals that appear on the financial statement will be incorrect , because not all the rows were loaded into the visual .
# # Additional resources for Power BI
# # Types of inventory journals
The following types of inventory journals are available :
When you use an inventory movement journal , you can add cost to an item when you add inventory , but you must manually allocate the additional cost to a particular general ledger account by specifying a general ledger offset account when you create the journal . This inventory journal type is useful if you want to overwrite the default posting accounts .
- An inventory issue at the &quot; from &quot; location .
- An inventory receipt at the &quot; to &quot; location .
Production input journals work like the item arrival journals but are used for production orders .
# # Posting journal lines
# # Data entity support for inventory journals
Data entities support the following types of integration scenarios :
- Asynchronous integration
Another difference between the journal data entities is the ability to use composite entities that include both the header and line data . Currently , you can use the composite entities for :

title : Purchase order overview
This article provides general information about purchase orders ( POs ) and links to additional articles that are related to the various stages that a PO goes through .
A purchase order ( PO ) is a document that represents an agreement with a vendor to buy goods or services . The document also helps keep track of product receipts that are made toward the order and , later , the accounting of vendor invoices that the vendor bills toward the order .
The following articles provide an overview of the various stages that a PO goes through :
# # Purchase order statuses
title : Inventory lookup in the point of sale ( POS )
# Inventory lookup in the point of sale ( POS )
# # Locations that inventory availability information is shown for
The list of locations includes two types of entities :
# # Opening the Dimension based matrix view to show all variants
You can also change the pivot for dimensions by selecting the new dimension to use .
- Sell an individual product variant to a customer by using cash and carry , in-store pickup , or shipment to an address .
- Provide the customer with ATP information for an individual product variant at a specific location .
The following table provides more information about the additional actions that are available .
- Calculate the cost of a manufactured item , and generate an associated item cost record within a costing version .
- Calculate the sales price of a manufactured item , and generate an associated item sales price record within a costing version .
- By default , the calculation quantity is set to the item &apos;s standard order quantity . However , you can override the default value .
- The calculation date or site can be mandated by the costing version , or user-specified values can be set when the date or site isn &apos;t mandated in the costing version . A future calculation date determines how pending cost records are used . BOM calculations use a pending cost record that has the nearest from-date that is on or before the calculation date .
- The calculation date or site can be mandated by the costing version , or user-specified values can be set when the date or site isn &apos;t mandated in the costing version .
Other variations in BOM calculations reflect the costing type and restrictions of the costing version :
# # # BOM calculations that use standard costs
- To help guarantee accurate and consistent calculation of standard costs , the explosion mode must be single-level .
- To help guarantee consistent results when the sales price of the items is calculated , the profit setting must be mandated . The profit setting can be used , and the item sales price records can be generated , only if the costing version allows for content of sales prices .
- The profit setting can be mandated , or it can be a default value . The profit setting can be used , and the item sales price records can be generated , only if the costing version allows for content of sales prices .
# # BOM calculations that use the fallback principle
The following situations illustrate two uses of the fallback principle :
# # BOM calculation of a suggested sales price
- An order-specific BOM calculation doesn &apos;t generate an item cost record within a costing version . Therefore , the BOM calculation policies aren &apos;t applied when an item cost record is created , or when a cost record is overwritten .
- An order-specific BOM calculation always uses the active cost records for components , cost categories , and indirect cost calculation formulas .

The type of project that you create for a project contract determines the method that is used to invoice project customers . You can change a project contract and the related project , but you can &apos;t change the project type .
By using a project contract , you can invoice one or more projects at the same time . The project contract also helps guarantee a consistent invoicing procedure for every subproject in a project structure .
Every project that will be invoiced must be associated with a project contract . The settings for a project contract apply to all projects and subprojects that are associated with that project contract .
# # Funding for project contracts
Some project contracts specify that multiple parties share the responsibility for funding the project costs . Here are some examples :
- A large customer that has multiple divisions requests that funding of a project be split by division .
- Your company shares the costs of a large project with an external organization .
- A road project is co-funded by two municipalities .
- A bridge project is funded by a government grant and a private corporation .
Here are some steps that you can take to make it easier to split the billing among multiple funding sources :
- Specify that all transactions that are entered for a project use the same sales currency as the project contract .
- Set up funding limits , so that a funding source isn &apos;t invoiced more than a specified amount toward a project .
- Select optional start and end dates to define the period when each funding rule is valid .
- Specify the percentage that each funding source is responsible for .
- Specify which funding source is responsible for rounding differences that are caused by funding allocation calculations .
- Set up rules that determine how project costs are invoiced to external customers and charged to internal organizations .
To determine which tax group to associate with a transaction , the project is searched for a tax group assignment . If no tax group assignment has been made at the project level , the project contract is searched .
The following table provides scenarios for managing funding allocation among multiple funding sources . These scenarios are based on the following assumptions :
- Priority settings are factored into the allocation of funds before other funding rule criteria are applied .
- No date range has been specified to define the period d when the funding rule is valid .
You have three funding sources that you want to use in the following order :
2 . Continue to use funding source 3 until it is exhausted .
3 . Use funding source 1 after funding source 3 is exhausted .
To accomplish this goal , you must do the following :
- Create the following funding rules :
This setup works because transactions are checked against rules and limits to determine whether any of them apply to the transaction . If no specific rules or limits apply to the transaction , the All transactions rule applies . The All transactions rule matches all transactions .
The following table examines this scenario in more detail .
You can set up the following types of billing rules :
When you are ready to invoice the customer , the amount to invoice for the project is calculated based on the billing rules , and a project invoice proposal is generated .
The following sections provide examples that show how to set up and manage billing rules for a project .
Your organization enters into an agreement to provide a total of five training sessions to a customer ’ s employees at a cost of 10,000 per training session . You invoice the customer after each training session .
When you set up the billing rules for the contract , you use the following values :
- The unit of delivery is one training session .
- The unit price is 10,000 per training session .
- The total number of units is five training sessions .
When you create a customer invoice for the first time , the invoice amount is automatically calculated based on the following information :
- You create an invoice for 8,667 and send it to the customer .
- Milestone 1 : Collect consumer data – March 31
- Milestone 2 : Analyze consumer data – April 30
- Milestone 3 : Present a product viability proposal – May 31
When you set up the project contract , you agree to bill the customer based on the milestone that has been completed . The billing rule setup includes the following steps :
- Define the project milestones .
- Define the amount to invoice the customer when each milestone is completed .
When you set up the project contract , create a billing rule to add a 10 percent management fee to the consulting hours that are charged to the project .
- 10 percent management fee = 2,000
- Total invoice amount = 22,000
If fees are taxable to a customer , and you select a sales tax group in the project contract , the sales tax group is automatically entered in a billing rule for fees .
When you set up the project contract , you agree to bill the customer each month for time and materials on the project . You create a billing rule that includes the following information :
- The contract period is six months .
- Consulting time is calculated at a rate of 150 per hour .
- Office supplies are invoiced at cost , and the total cost for the project must not exceed 10,000 .
- You create a customer invoice at the end of each calendar month during the project .

title : Row definitions in financial report designer
# Row definitions in financial report designer
A row definition is a report component , or building block , that specifies the contents of each row on a financial report . A row definition can be combined with column definitions , reporting tree definitions , and report definitions to create a building block group that can be used by multiple companies .
# # Create a row definition
# # Open a row definition
2 . Double-click the name of the row definition to open .
# # Contents of a row definition
A row definition can contain up to 20,000 financial dimension rows and can include the following information :
&gt; You can set up a row definition to pull data from the financial dimensions system every time that the report is generated .
- Row totals and formulas that are based on the linked financial data
- References to the financial dimensions system
- Totals or calculations that are based on the data
There are two methods for entering information in a row definition :
# # Add dimensions in a row definition
&#124; Dimension Range Start &#124; The first value for this dimension to add to the row definition . &#124;
&#124; Dimension Range End &#124; The last value for this dimension to add to the row definition . &#124;

title : Acquire assets through procurement
This topic describes how to set up the integration between Fixed assets and Accounts payable to automatically create fixed assets from purchase orders or vendor invoices , or automatically post acquisition and acquisition adjustment transactions for fixed assets .
The following methods are available for integrating Fixed assets and Accounts payable , and you must use the same method for all fixed assets :
- You manually create a fixed asset before you add the fixed asset number to the line on the purchase order or vendor invoice . An acquisition transaction automatically is posted for the asset when you post the vendor invoice . This is the default method .
- You manually create a fixed asset before you add the fixed asset number to the line on the purchase order or vendor invoice . No acquisition transaction is posted for the asset when you post the vendor invoice .
- A fixed asset automatically is created when you post a product receipt or vendor invoice that has the Create a new fixed asset check box selected . An acquisition transaction automatically is posted for the asset when you post the vendor invoice .
Whether you manually create fixed assets or use a more flexible approach , you must also decide whether an acquisition transaction can be posted only in Fixed assets , or whether it can be posted when you post a vendor invoice . Some organizations prefer that users manually create acquisition and acquisition transactions in Fixed assets by using manual journal entries or proposals .
This topic discusses the details of each method .
# # Methods for manually creating fixed assets
When you post a vendor invoice that has a fixed asset number entered in the lines , if the Allow asset acquisition from Purchasing option is selected in the Fixed assets parameters page , the acquisition is posted automatically , and the status of the asset changes to Open .
If an acquisition cannot be posted , you can either manually enter an acquisition transaction in Fixed assets , or use an acquisition proposal in the Fixed assets journal to create multiple acquisition transactions at the same time .
&gt; If Fixed assets is set up to limit acquisition transaction posting to a specific user group , you must be a member of that user group to post acquisition transactions from invoices .
# # Methods for automatically creating fixed assets
A capitalization threshold is a currency amount that determines whether assets are depreciated if they meet the specified amount . For example , if you purchase an asset and the purchase amount is less than the capitalization threshold , the asset is not designated to depreciate ; if the purchase amount meets or exceeds the threshold , the asset is designated to depreciate .
You can set up the capitalization threshold in the Fixed asset groups page .
The following scenario discusses a full cycle of a Fixed assets and Accounts payable integration . A sample setup is shown and the use of acquisition proposals is also described .
In this scenario , the system is set up as follows :
- Assets are automatically created during product receipt or vendor invoice posting , but Fixed assets is set up to prevent posting acquisition transactions from Accounts payable .
- Accounts are specified in the Account type field for the Fixed asset receipt and Fixed asset issue account types in the Item groups page .
The following transactions occurred .
The following are variations for this scenario :
- If the laptop cost is 1,400 instead of 1,600 , the capitalization threshold is not reached . Therefore , the asset is created and the Depreciation option is cleared .

title : Reporting tree definitions in financial reports
# Reporting tree definitions in financial reports
This article provides information about reporting tree definitions . A reporting tree definition is a report component , or building block , that helps define the structure and hierarchy of your organization .
# # Reporting tree best practices
Before you create a reporting tree , consider the following best practices :
- First determine which reporting dimensions your legal entity or company requires .
- Consider how you &apos;ve set up your structure , and then draw an organizational chart of your company . The organizational chart will help you visualize how to group the reporting units into one or more reporting trees .
- You must also consider the best way to build your trees . You can use an automated build process to generate a reporting tree , or you can manually create a reporting tree . It &apos;s important that you understand both methods before you design your trees .
- You can use the reporting units that are defined in your financial data system to add reporting units to the reporting tree definition .
# # Create multiple reporting trees
# # Create a reporting tree definition
A reporting tree definition contains the columns that are described in the following table .
&#124; Reporting tree column &#124; Description &#124;
&#124; External file &#124; The file path of the financial reporting worksheet to pull data from . &#124;
&#124; Page Options &#124; This column controls whether the details for the reporting unit are suppressed when the report is viewed or printed . &#124;
&#124; Additional Text &#124; Text that is included on the report . &#124;
# # # Open an existing reporting tree definition
2 . Double-click a name in the reporting tree list to open it .
When you use a reporting tree , you can aggregate amounts from child reporting units at the level of the parent reporting unit . This aggregation is known as rolling up the data . The following rules are used to roll up amounts to parent units in a reporting tree :
- In a reporting tree , child units must contain dimensions , unless the reporting tree is a single-level tree . Parent units usually don &apos;t contain dimensions in a reporting tree .
&gt; If you specify dimensions for both child units and parent units , you might cause duplication of data in the report .
# # # Manage reporting units
# # # Reporting unit structure
The following types of reporting units are used in financial reporting :
- A detail unit draws information directly from the financial data , from an Excel worksheet , or from another financial reporting worksheet .
- A summary unit summarizes data from lower-level units .
# # # Organize reporting units
You can rearrange the organizational structure of a reporting tree definition by moving reporting units in the graphical view . You can also promote reporting units to a higher level in the reporting tree or demote them to a lower level .
1 . In Report Designer , open the reporting tree definition to modify .
2 . In the graphical view of the reporting tree definition , select a reporting unit .
# # # Add text about a reporting unit
4 . To add more text entries for this reporting unit , enter the text in an empty row .
# # # Remove additional text from a reporting unit
# # # Restrict access to a reporting unit
You can prevent certain users and groups from accessing a reporting unit . You can also define restrictions so that they apply to child reporting units of the reporting unit .
# # # Link to reports
# # # Identify the report in a reporting tree
# # # Reporting unit structure – Example 1
Here is the structure of the reporting units in the following reporting tree :
- The higher-level summary units summarize information from the detail units .
# # # Reporting unit structure – Example 2
In the following diagram , the reporting tree has an organizational structure that is divided by business function .
# # # Example of the Insert Reporting Units from Dimensions dialog box
# # # Examples of data roll-up
The following examples show possible information that is used in a reporting tree definition for data that is rolled up .

Fixed assets can be integrated with General ledger , Inventory management , Accounts receivable , and Accounts payable . You can also set up Fixed assets so that it is integrated with purchase orders .
In the inventory journal for fixed assets , you can enter the acquisition of fixed assets that the legal entity has produced or constructed for itself . You can then transfer inventory items to fixed assets either as an acquisition or as part of an acquisition .
If you use specific receipt and issue accounts on item groups for fixed assets , you can use the same inventory item both for internal purchases and as stock for resale .
- The invoice line contains an existing fixed asset for internal purposes .
The accounts that fixed asset transactions are posted to depend on two factors : whether the assets are purchased or constructed by the legal entity , and the transaction type of the asset .
If the book includes a derived book , the derived book transaction is created when you post the customer invoice .
If the book includes a derived book , the derived book transaction is created when you post the vendor invoice .

Vendor rebates help companies better manage their supplier rebate programs by automating tasks that are required in order to administer , track , and claim rebates that are earned .
This topic provides an overview of the most common tasks that you might want to perform when you work with vendor rebates . The overview covers the following tasks :
- Review details of a rebate agreement .
- Identify orders that qualify for rebates , and generate rebate claims .
- Review and approve claims .
- Negotiate vendor price , discount , and rebate agreements .
- Manage staff that processes rebate claims and collects payments .
- Order inventory at the best possible prices .
People in these positions are looking for ways to achieve various goals . Here are some examples :
- Flexibly accommodate different types of vendor promotion programs and rebate conditions .
- Improve cash flow forecasts by accruing for future receivables .
- Have a quantified basis for ongoing and future negotiations with vendors about rebates .
# # Review details of a vendor rebate agreement
On the * * Vendor rebate agreements * * page , you can view details about the negotiated conditions of a vendor agreement .
The agreement ’ s header specifies the general conditions that qualify a company for rebates . In effect , the header information specifies that a vendor grants a rebate when a specific product is bought in a specific quantity . On the header , you also specify the unit of measure rebate option and the calculation date type .
On the agreement lines , you can specify the vendor rebate agreement in more detail .
# # Identify orders that qualify for rebates , and generate rebate claims
# # Review and approve claims
Rebate claims that are generated represent the future payments that can be expected from the vendor . Before a credit note is issued to the vendor , the agreement owner typically wants to review the claims and approve them . However , note that the status of a claim determines whether the claim is ready to go through the approval process .
# # # The status of claims and the effect on the approval process
# # # Approve claims , and view postings and invoice details
2 . Close the rebate claim .
A Rebate accrual journal is posted for the claim amount . This posting debits the Accrued Vendor Rebates Receivable account for the expected vendor credit and credits the interim Accrued Vendor Rebates Received account for the expected gain .
To move the claims to the regular A / P process , the A / P clerk must now complete the rebate claim handling by running the Process function .
The message bars and the fact that the status is changed to * * Completed * * indicate that the following events have occurred :
- A Rebate accrual journal posting has reversed the previous interim amounts on the accrual receivable and expense accounts .
- A vendor invoice ( credit note ) for the rebate amount has been created .
- When the vendor invoice is posted , either automatically or manually , the vendor ’ s Payable account has been debited , and the Discounts and Allowances Received account has been credited .
The process for handling vendor rebates involves multiple manual tracking tasks that are often tedious . By automating these tasks , the vendor rebate management feature can help you move through the following processes :
- Accruing the expected receivable and interim gain in the general ledger
- Updating the vendor balance and the income statement with the allowance that is due

# Amortize constant costs for a manufactured item
A manufactured item ’ s constant costs reflect the operation setup times and the components that have a constant quantity or a constant scrap amount .
The concept of a costing lot size is used to amortize these constant costs in the calculated cost of a manufactured item . This concept has several synonyms , one of which is accounting lot size . The concept of amortizing constant costs also has several synonyms , one of which is proportional constant costs .
The quantity of a costing lot size for a manufactured item is used in a bill of material ( BOM ) calculation . The quantity depends on how you initiate and perform the BOM calculation , as illustrated by the following :

# Waive , reinstate , or reverse interest fees
This article explains how to waive , reinstate , and reverse charges for interest and fees .
- Waived charges are forgiven . You might waive a charge if , for example , a customer disputes the charge , and you want to maintain a good business relationship with that customer .
- Reinstated charges become due again . You can reinstate charges that were previously waived . You might have to reinstate charges if you determine that they should not have been waived .
&gt; You can also use a separate process to write off bad debts . This process marks all customer transactions for settlement instead of waiving only the charges that are part of interest notes .
# # Adjust interest for invoices
In addition to adjusting interest notes , you can remove the interest charges on invoices by using one of the following processes . Both processes also make adjustments to the related interest notes .
# # # Correct an invoice that has associated interest
# # # Reverse a customer transaction that has associated interest
You can reverse a customer transaction on an invoice if an invoice was created incorrectly . If the reversed customer transaction has interest that is included on an interest note , and if the interest note was posted , interest on the transaction is also reversed on the interest note . The interest note is canceled if it hasn &apos;t been posted .
# # Waive or reinstate interest notes
You can waive or reinstate all the charges on interest notes that you select . When you waive charges , the total amount to waive can &apos;t exceed any amount limits that have been set . You can reinstate an interest note only if it was previously waived .
# # Waive or reinstate interest transactions
# # Waive or reinstate fees
You can waive or reinstate specific fees on an interest note , instead of adjusting all the charges on that interest note . When you waive charges , the total amount to waive can &apos;t exceed any amount limits that have been set . You can reinstate a fee only if it was previously waived .
You can reverse all the charges on interest notes that you select . Reversed charges are removed from a customer ’ s account and are no longer due . After the interest note is reversed , you can recalculate interest and create a new interest note .
You can reverse all the interest transactions that you select . Reversed charges are removed from a customer ’ s account and are no longer due . After the transactions are reversed , you can recalculate interest and create a new interest note .

title : Invoice matching and intercompany purchase orders
# Invoice matching and intercompany purchase orders
The purchasing legal entity that is involved in an intercompany trade transaction might be set up to use accounts payable invoice matching . In this case , the posting requirements for both intercompany trade and accounts payable invoice matching must be met before intercompany vendor invoices can be posted .
The examples in this topic use the following setup for intercompany trade :
- Fabrikam Purchase is the purchasing legal entity .
- Fabrikam Sales is the selling legal entity .
- Customer 4020 exists in Fabrikam Sales .
- Vendor 3024 exists in Fabrikam Purchase .
The examples use the following setup for accounts payable invoice matching for Fabrikam Purchase :
- On the Accounts payable parameters page , the Enable invoice matching validation option is selected .
- On the Accounts payable parameters page , the Post invoice with discrepancies field is set to Require approval .
- The price tolerance percentage for the legal entity is 2 percent .
# # Example : Price matching and intercompany trade

&#124; Rejected &#124; The PO was rejected during the approval process . &#124; No &#124;
&#124; Approved &#124; The PO was approved . &#124; Yes &#124;
There is also an option to generate a pro-forma confirmation for an order before the actual confirmation has been processed . This option just creates a report that you can share with the vendor . It doesn ’ t create any journal information .
- Accounting distributions are created , and order checks and budget checks occur if this functionality has been enabled . If either check fails , you receive an error message that states that changes must be made to the PO before it can be confirmed again .
After an order has been confirmed , you can no longer delete it . However , you can cancel the total quantity or any remaining quantity on an order , provided that the quantity hasn ’ t been received or invoiced .
This article provides information about different types of postings in the production process .

This article provides information about purchase agreements . A purchase agreement is a contract that commits an organization to buy a specified quantity or amount by using multiple purchase orders over time . In exchange for this commitment , the buyer receives special prices and discounts .
Purchase agreements can apply to a specific quantity of a product , a specific currency amount of a product , or a specific currency amount of the products in a procurement category . The prices and discounts of the purchase agreement override the prices and discounts that are specified in any trade agreements that exist .
Each line in a purchase agreement is a commitment to buy something . You can use lines from multiple purchase orders ( POs ) to fulfill the commitment . There are four types of commitments :
# # Pricing terms for purchase agreements
# # Policies for purchase agreements
The following policies affect the way that the link between a purchase agreement commitment and the corresponding PO lines works :
# # Fulfillment calculations for purchase agreements
The * * Fulfillment * * area shows the remaining amount or quantity that is required to fulfill the commitment .
You can access the PO lines and the invoice lines that contribute to the fulfillment calculation by selecting the * * Related information * * action on the lines or on the header of a purchase agreement .
# # Confirmations and version history for purchase agreements
# # Applying purchase agreements in the ordering process
You can select a purchase agreement only when you &apos;re creating a PO . You can &apos;t select a purchase agreement after the PO has been created .
# # Purchase agreements and intercompany trade
You can create a purchase agreement or sales agreement for one of the intercompany trading parties . You can then generate the corresponding sales agreement or purchase agreement for the other intercompany trading party in the other legal entity .
If you create an intercompany PO that uses the intercompany purchase agreement in one legal entity , the corresponding intercompany sales order uses the corresponding intercompany sales agreement in the other legal entity . The fulfillment of the sales agreement commitments and the fulfillment of the purchase agreements are synchronized , just as the intercompany sales order and the intercompany PO are synchronized .
# # Financial dimensions on purchase agreements
You can copy financial dimensions to document headers or to individual lines of a purchase agreement . If you change the dimensions in the agreement header or on the agreement line , the change doesn &apos;t affect any released orders , but it will be reflected on any new orders .

title : Accruing subscriptions
With service subscriptions , you manually accrue revenue in the periods following the date when you invoiced a fee transaction .
Accrual periods are created for the invoice period that you set up for the subscription fee , and the accrual periods are based on the period code of the subscription .
You can accrue and reverse accrued revenue .
# # Reverse accruals of credit amounts
If you credit invoiced subscription amounts , you can use two methods to reverse the accrual amounts :
- You can have the accrued amounts reversed on the date where the credit note is posted or on the original posting date of the accrual .
# # Set up accounts for accrual of subscription revenue
# # Enable revenue accrual on a subscription group
You must set up an invoicing period code . Unless you want to accrue revenue in the same time intervals as you use for invoicing , you must also set up an accrual period .

title : Trade allowance management
- Running the negotiated promotion contracts through ongoing sales and generating bill-back claims
- Calculating , approving , and processing the generated claims , and passing them on to Accounts receivable ( A / R ) as deductions for payment settlement
- Reconciling the customer ’ s short-pay with the deduction that is due
- Tracking use of the promotional fund , and evaluating program profitability and effectiveness
- High-level budgets and fund allocation
- Planning and analyzing sales promotions
- Managing staff that processes bill-back claims , runs payments based on merchandizing events , and settles short-pays and deductions
People in these roles are looking for ways to achieve these goals :
- Better use marketing promotional funds .
- Flexibly accommodate different types of promotion programs and allowances .
- Improve cash flow forecasts by accruing for future liability .
- Have a quantified basis for ongoing and future negotiations with customers about promotions .
# # Promotional fund and Trade allowance agreement
A trade allowance agreement is an incentive program where pay-for-performance monetary rewards are offered to customers that achieve specific volume targets and / or behavioral goals . Promotional funds are budgeted expenditures . In that way , the promotional campaigns can be captured .

When the sales invoice is posted , a corresponding bill-back claim is generated for each invoice line .
# # Process claims and pass them as deductions to A / R
The next steps in the process for handling bill-backs are to review , calculate , and approve claims , and then convert them into deductions .
The Bill back workbench is where the promotion agreement owner periodically reviews and processes the claims that are generated . It &apos;s also where the A / R administrator converts the approved claims into deductions or regular payments , depending on the payment method for the claim .
# # # Process claims and pass them to A / R
- The claims have been transferred to the temporary customer balance as deductions .
- The rebate accrual account has been credited to represent the future liability for the customer .
- The rebate expense account has been debited to recognize the cost that was incurred in connection with the sales .
To complete the process , the A / R clerk must now handle the accrual deductions by transferring them to the customers balance as a credit note ( liability ) .
- The customer &apos;s receivable account has been credited .
- The rebate accrual account has been debited .
# # Settle the deduction that is due and the customer short-pay by using the Deduction workbench
The collection manager is now responsible for settling the open credit note transaction and the short-pay transaction against each other in the Deduction workbench .

This topic provides information about dimension hierarchies . You use a dimension hierarchy to define the reporting structure , cost policies , and security setup in Cost accounting .
Dimension hierarchies are used in various places in Cost accounting . A dimension hierarchy lets you define the following information :
- The reporting structure that fits into the organization &apos;s requirements
Here is an example of a dimension hierarchy .
A dimension hierarchy can be created for the following types of dimensions :
&gt; - You can create multiple dimension hierarchies for the same dimension if different perspectives are required .
&gt; - A dimension hierarchy can be associated with only one dimension .
# # Dimension hierarchy type
# # # Dimension categorization hierarchy
- A dimension member can be associated more than one time in the hierarchy structure .
- You can put a cost element dimension member in different nodes by assigning a cost behavior to the leaf node .
# # # Dimension classification hierarchy
A dimension hierarchy is created as a tree structure that has node and leaf node relationships .
- A node can ’ t have both subnodes and leaf nodes assigned to it .
- A leaf node can be assigned only at the lowest level in the hierarchy .
A small company has the following organization structure , where Finance and Human resources are departments under Admin , and Assembly and Packaging are departments under Production .
A cost object dimension represents all the cost centers in the organization .
The cost object dimension that represents all the cost centers can be set up as shown here .
A cost element dimension represents all the cost elements in the organization .
The cost element dimension that represents all the cost elements can be set up as shown here .
A dimension hierarchy that meets the organizational reporting requirements can be set up as shown here .
&#124; Dimension hierarchy name &#124; Dimension &#124; Dimension hierarchy type name &#124; Access list hierarchy &#124;
&#124; Organization &#124; Cost centers &#124; Dimension classification hierarchy &#124; No &#124;
The dimension hierarchy for reporting can be set up as shown here .
&#124; Dimension hierarchy name &#124; Dimension &#124; Dimension hierarchy type name &#124;
&#124; Cost behavior &#124; Cost elements &#124; Dimension classification hierarchy &#124;
The dimension hierarchy for the policy can be set up as shown here .
# # # Copy a hierarchy
You can copy a current dimension hierarchy as the starting point for a new dimension hierarchy . This approach can be useful if you want to compare the previous dimension hierarchy to the new dimension hierarchy .
# # # Rearrange nodes in a hierarchy
# # Define dimension hierarchies for reporting
Dimension hierarchies are available in the following reporting tools . This approach helps guarantee consistency in the reporting structure .
- Controlled by configuration .
- Provides the option to select specific dimension hierarchies per export definition :
- One cost element dimension hierarchy ( mandatory )
- One cost object dimension hierarchy ( optional )
- One statistical dimension hierarchy ( optional )
- All dimension hierarchies are available .
The following example shows what a dimension hierarchy might look like in the reporting structure .
# # # Update the dimension hierarchies that are used for reporting
Over time , the dimension hierarchies that are used in the previously mentioned reporting tools will have to be updated . You can update dimension hierarchies by refreshing the client .
Updates to dimension hierarchies are picked up every 24 hours by a pre-cached job . After the exported data is updated , the updated dimension hierarchies are available in the following tools :
# # Define dimension hierarchies for cost policies
Cost accounting consists of multiple policies where detailed rules are defined . You must define one or more dimension hierarchies for the following policies :
- Cost rollup
A new cost behavior policy is created , and appropriate dimension hierarchies are assigned to the policy , as shown here .
&#124; Policy name &#124; Cost element dimension hierarchy &#124; Cost object dimension hierarchy &#124; Accounting currency &#124;
The preceding rules show the flexibility that dimension hierarchies provide . By defining high-level rules , you can help minimize maintenance . You can then define detailed rules to fit into a specific business objective .
If the dimension hierarchies that are used in rules are updated , the system automatically brings the updates forward .
If a level of granularity in the rules is no longer required , the rule can be expired .
# # Define dimension hierarchies for security setup
Cost accounting data should be made available to all managers who are responsible for a reporting unit . In Cost accounting terminology , a reporting unit is represented as a cost object or a set of cost objects .
- The use of dimension hierarchies applies only when the dimension value that is selected in the dimension hierarchy reference is a cost object dimension .
- Only one dimension hierarchy can be enabled per cost object dimension in the access list hierarchy .
&gt; Cost accountants should be assigned to the top level of the hierarchy , so that they can see all entries in Cost accounting .
The settings for the access list hierarchy are used to control the data that is shown in the following areas :
- Data in forms that are used to drill through scenarios
- Balances in cards
- Data that is shown in Power BI visualizations

&#124; Month &#124; Number of pieces required &#124;
&#124; May through December &#124; 1,000 &#124;
# # Example 2 : Transactions reduction key forecast reduction principle
This example shows how actual orders that occur during the periods that are defined by the reduction key reduce demand forecast requirements .
The following sales orders exist on January 1 .
&#124; Month &#124; Number of pieces ordered &#124;
If you use the same demand forecast of 1,000 pieces per month , the following requirement quantities are transferred to the master plan .
1 . Create a demand forecast for the following dates and quantities .
&#124; January 12 &#124; 1,000 &#124;
In this forecast , there isn &apos;t a clear period between the forecast dates : between the first and second dates there is a four-day span , and between the second and third dates there is a seven-day span . These various spans are the dynamic periods .
2 . Create sales order lines as follows .
&#124; Date &#124; Sales order quantity &#124;
&#124; December 15 in the previous year &#124; 500 &#124;
The forecast will be reduced as follows :
- The first sales order isn &apos;t within any period , so it won &apos;t reduce any forecast .
- The second sales order is between January 1 and January 5 , so it will reduce the forecast for January 1 by 100 .
- The third sales order is between January 5 and January 12 , so it will reduce the forecast for January 5 by 200 .
The following planned order will be created to fulfill the forecast .
&#124; Demand forecast date &#124; Reduced quantity &#124;
- Forecast requirements are reduced by the actual order transactions that occur during the dynamic period . The dynamic period covers the current forecast dates and ends at the start of the next forecast .
- This method doesn &apos;t use or require a reduction key .
- When this option is used , the following behavior occurs :
- If there is no future forecast , forecast requirements from the last forecast that was entered are reduced .
- Time fences are included in the forecast reduction calculation .
- Positive days are included in the forecast reduction calculation .
- If actual order transactions exceed the forecasted requirements , the remaining transactions aren &apos;t forwarded to the next forecast period .

This article provides general information about the consolidation and elimination process . It includes answers to some frequently asked questions .
Eliminations can be reported in multiple ways :
- A separate company can be created and used to manually determine and post elimination transactions . This company can be used in the consolidation process or in financial reporting .
- The accounts and financial dimensions that are used to determine intercompany activity can be filtered on a row definition or column definition in Financial reporting , and full drill-down capabilities can be used . A calculated column or row can then be used to remove the accounts and financial dimensions from the consolidated total .
There are many consolidation scenarios , and each method can handle the scenarios in different ways .

title : Moving average
Moving average is a perpetual costing method based on the average principle , where the costs on inventory issues do not change when the purchase cost does . The difference is capitalized and is based on a proportional calculation . The amount that remains is expensed .
When you use moving average , inventory settlements and inventory marking are not supported . Inventory close does not affect products that have moving average as the inventory model group , and it does not generate any settlements between the transactions .
The following are prerequisites when you use moving average cost as a costing method .
Products can be converted to use the moving average inventory valuation method . This type of conversion is usually done at the end of the year , after the last month of the current year is closed . It is done by using the product ’ s current costing model . You can change your inventory costing method from a costing method that is based on average cost or standard cost to a method that is based on moving average .
If you are changing your costing method from a standard costing method to a moving average method , you have to complete the following tasks :
3 . Make adjustments to get the quantity and value back into inventory .
The following examples illustrate the effect of using the moving average costing method . There are four configurations :
- Purchase order and proportionally expensed cost difference
- Moving average product and inventory adjustment
- Moving average with production
- Moving average with a backdated transaction
# # Purchase order and proportionally expensed cost difference
In this example , a purchase order is created and received at one cost , and the purchase invoice is posted with a different cost .
1 . Create a purchase order for a quantity of 2 and a unit price of 10.00 .
2 . Create a purchase receipt of the product .
3 . Create a sales order for a quantity of 1 and a unit price of 10.00 .
4 . Create a purchase invoice for a quantity of 2 and a unit price of 12.00 .
# # Moving average product and inventory adjustment
If you need to adjust the moving average cost of a product , inventory adjustments are allowed as of today ’ s date . You cannot backdate an inventory adjustment to correct the moving average cost of a product . You cannot have the cost flow through subsequent transactions .
In this example , the moving average cost is adjusted for a product .
3 . The adjustment is posted .
* * Note : * * You can only adjust the moving average cost as of today ’ s date .
# # Moving average with a backdated transaction
2 . The inventory transaction history for the product would resemble the following :

- Performance of the * * Allowed value details * * control
( LINK TO VIDEO THAT WILL BE CREATED )
- Make main account first or as close to the front of the account structure as possible , so users get the best guided experience they can during account entry .
- Reuse account structures as much as possible to reduce maintenance across your legal entities .
- For variations across legal entities , consider using advanced rules so that account structures can be reused .
- When defining allowed values , use ranges and wildcards as much as possible . This not only allows you to grow and change without maintenance , but the system also performs more ideally with this configuration .
- Do not just put an asterisk for every segment in the account structure and then solely rely on the advanced rules . This can be difficult to manage and often leads to user error during maintenance that can make the system unable to post .

title : Shift and cash drawer management
# Shift and cash drawer management
This topic explains how to set up and use shifts in retail point of sale ( POS ) .
Retail provides several configuration options and POS operations to support a wide range of end-of-day business processes for the POS . This section describes some typical shift scenarios .
&gt; Only one shared shift can be open at a time in each store . Shared shifts and stand-alone shifts can be used in the same store .
# # Shift and drawer operations
The POS requires that users have an active , open shift in order to perform any operations that will produce a financial transaction , such as a sale , return , or customer order .
# # # Declare start amount
* Float entries * are non-sales transactions that are performed in an active shift to increase the amount of cash in the cash drawer . A typical example of a float entry is a transaction to add additional change to the drawer when it &apos;s running low .
Suspension of a shift prevents any new transactions or changes to the shift until it &apos;s resumed .
This operation lets users resume a previously suspended shift on any register that doesn &apos;t already have an active shift .
# # # Blind close shift
Blind-closed shifts are often used to free up a register for a new user or shift without first having to fully count , reconcile , and close the shift .
This operation generates and prints an X report for the current active shift .
This operation reprints the last Z report that the system generated when a shift was closed .
# # Shift and drawer permissions
The following POS permissions affect what a user can and can &apos;t do in various scenarios :
Although every retailer has different business requirements , we recommend that you set up your system in the following way to avoid situations where differences of this type occur :
This setup helps guarantee that back-office statements include the same transactions as shifts in the POS , and that the data is summarized by that shift .

title : Service level agreements
A service level agreement ( SLA ) is an agreement between a service company and a service customer . In a SLA , the customer agrees to a minimum response time based on when the service company records the issue and when the issue is resolved .
A SLA enforces a standard level of service that is offered to customers , and also makes it transparent to a service company when a service job should be completed .
Any number of SLAs can be created to offer service customers different levels of service .

# # Register and post a partial quantity
title : Report production orders as finished
# Report production orders as finished
Report as finished is a production stage . At this stage , a finished product is reported and moved from the production order to the inventory .
When a quantity of the finished goods is reported as finished on a production order it is updated as on-hand in the inventory . Partial quantities of the originally planned order quantity can be reported as finished . It is also possible to report error quantities with an associated error reason when reporting quantities as finished . When the production order reach the stage Reported as finished it indicates that no more quantity is going to be reported at the production order .
The following characteristics are also associated with the * * Report as finished * * process :
- It is possible to set up consumption of raw material and time that are proportional to the reported quantity ( back-flushing )
- Put-away work can be generated for items that are enabled for warehouse processes .
- The planned or standard cost value of the finished goods can be set up to be reported to ledger accounts .
- A quality order can be created for the reported quantity based on the setup of a quality association .
The quantity is reported to the output location . Warehouse work is then generated to move the quantity from the output location to its final destination defined by the location directive for the put-away work .

Users can drill down on the balances to view the transactions that make up the balance .
title : Monitor service activities
If you must redistribute service activity assignments , you can move the graphical representation of a service activity to assign it to a different employee or a different date and time .
You can use flex groups to set the following rules and principles for a worker &apos;s flexible hours :
- Rules for flex regulations
- Principle for calculating the worker &apos;s flex balance
# # Set up flexible working hours in flex groups
# # Associate workers with flex groups
# # Rules for flex regulations
If the worker &apos;s allowed flex maximum is exceeded , you can use these methods to adjust the worker &apos;s flex balance by making a flex regulation :
- The worker &apos;s flex account can be adjusted back to the specified allowed maximum , but without compensating the worker &apos;s pay for the number of hours that the worker worked above the allowed maximum .
- The number of hours that the worker worked above the allowed maximum can be converted to pay . This conversion is done by generating pay items for a specific pay type .
You can adjust a flex balance at the following times :
# # Principle for calculating a worker &apos;s flex balance
The following two principles can be used :
A worker who can work flexible hours has a negative flex account .
The worker is associated with a flex group that has the following configuration :
As the difference between the worker &apos;s flex account and his allowed flex minimum indicates , the worker has exceeded his allowed flex minimum by 3.5 hours .
- The worker &apos;s flex account is adjusted by 3.5 hours . Therefore , the flex balance of -4.0 hours becomes adjusted to the worker &apos;s allowed flex minimum of -0.5 hours .
A worker who can work flexible hours has a positive flex account .
As the difference between the worker &apos;s flex account and her allowed flex maximum indicates , the worker has exceeded her allowed flex maximum by 4.0 hours .
- The worker &apos;s flex account is adjusted by -4.0 hours . Therefore , the flex balance of 6.0 hours becomes adjusted to the worker &apos;s allowed flex maximum of 2.0 hours .
Next , follow these steps to set up a pay type and add lines of the new type to a pay profile .
The worker enters the following registrations for the day .
When you transfer the registrations , you will notice that the amount of Flex + time is changed from 6.0 hours to 8.0 hours .
This change occurs after the transfer because the flexible hours have been calculated based on pay types instead of time . The following table shows how the eight hours are calculated .
title : Sales tax overview
This topic provides an overview of the sales tax system . It explains the elements of the sales tax setup and how they work together .
The following diagram shows the entities of the tax setup and how they are related .
Every sales tax code must also be linked to a ledger posting group . A ledger posting group specifies the main accounts that amounts for the sales tax codes will be posted to .
The following table describes the entities and the sequence for the tax setup .
&#124; Setup activity &#124; Required / Optional and description &#124;
# # Sales tax on transactions
# # Sales tax settlement and reporting
After the sales tax has been paid , the balance on the sales tax settlement account should be balanced against the bank account . If the sales tax authority that is specified on the sales tax settlement period is related to a vendor account , the sales tax balance is posted as an open vendor invoice and can be included in the regular payment proposal .
You settle sales taxes each month . On June 15 , you create a customer invoice of 10,000 , plus sales tax .
- The sales tax is 25 percent , or 2,500 .
- The invoice payment is due July 30 .
You typically would have to settle and pay 2,500 to the tax authority when the invoice is posted in June , even though you have not received the payment from the customer .
However , if you are using a conditional sales tax , you settle with the tax authority when you receive the payment from the customer on July 30 .
title : Upgrade budget planning
- Budget plan folders ( Budget planning configuration )
- Scenario constraints ( Budget planning configuration )
- Templates for Budget planning stage rules and templates ( Budget planning process )
- Matrix fields for worksheet templates
- Budget plan Microsoft Excel template wizard
Some new concepts can &apos;t be directly upgraded from the previous functionality . Therefore , you must complete some reconfiguration to address these new concepts . The following sections describe the concepts that have replaced the items in the preceding list .
# # # Budget planning processes
# # Configuring an upgraded environment from AX 2012
# # # Define columns and layouts
- Budget plan scenarios : Actuals , Baseline , Budget Request , Budget Approved
The following columns will be created in Finance and Operations :
&#124; Column name &#124; Budget plan scenario &#124; Column time period &#124; Year offset &#124;
# # # Update budget planning processes to use the appropriate layout for each budget stage
5 . Continue to select the same or different layouts for the various budget planning stages , and then save your changes .
# # Additional features to consider in your budgeting process
# # # Budget planning workspace
As part of the budget process , it &apos;s vital that you understand key dates and deadlines . You can now configure dates so that they have descriptions . Budgeting users will see these descriptions when they open budgets to edit or view anything that is assigned to them .
# # # Copy from Budget Plan allocation
# # # Generating budget plans from new budget sources
- Generate Budget Plan from Demand Forecast
- Generate Budget Plan from Supply Forecast
- Generate Budget Plan from Project
- Generate Budget Plan from Budget Register
# # # More complete tracking of amounts
# # # Do not convert currency in aggregation
# # # Looking back from a budget plan to other modules that contributed to the budget
Budget plans can be generated from demand or supply forecasts , project , and other areas . The Budget plans by dimension set inquiry includes several options that let you run queries to identify the data that was the source for the budget plan .
# # # Overwrite or append to plan for allocation schedules
# # # Default financial dimension set for budget planning configuration
Several data entities have been added to enable rapid implementation of Budget planning . The entities also let you make many changes through Excel . Therefore , you don &apos;t have to create items one at a time through the client . Here is a list of the new data entities :
- Budget plan stages
- Budget plan workflow stage
- Budget plan allocation schedules
- Budget plan stage allocations
- Budget plan layout elements
title : Budget planning overview
This article introduces budget planning , and contains information to help you configure budget planning and set up budget planning processes .
You can use budget planning to perform the following tasks :
- Analyze and update budget plans for multiple scenarios .
- Consolidate multiple budget plans from a lower level of the organization into a single parent budget plan at a higher level of the organization . You can also develop a single budget plan at a higher level of the organization and allocate the budget to lower levels of the organization .
# # # Create a budget planning schema
# # # Organization hierarchy for budget planning
# # # Budget planning workflows stages
Budget planning workflows are used together with Budgeting workflows to manage the creation and evolution of budget plans .
The workflow includes elements for allocation to sales departments and aggregation of their submissions , review by the budget manager , approval by the CFO , and stage transitions between each stage .
# # # Parameters , scenarios , and stages
Stage allocations are used to automatically allocate budget plan lines during workflow processing . When stage allocations are used , budget plan lines in the destination scenario can be created and modified without the intervention of the budget plan preparer or reviewer .
In the example schema that appears earlier in this article , an allocation is performed to transfer amounts from a budget plan and scenarios in the headquarters Baseline stage to another budget plan and scenarios in the Sales department Estimate stage . The following illustration shows the relevant section of the example schema .
Additionally , in the example schema , an aggregation is done from budget plans and scenarios in the Sales department Submitted stage to a parent plan in the HQ Rollup stage . The following illustration shows the relevant section of the example schema .
# # # Columns and layouts
Budget figures appear on a budget plan in rows and columns . You must first define the columns , and then you can create a layout to define the presentation of the columns .
To define a column , select a budget plan scenario . The line amounts from that scenario are shown on the budget plan . You can select a period to filter the amount , and you can also apply filters that are based on the ledger account .
&gt; The template should be saved to a location that the user has access to , so that it can be uploaded to the layout after editing is completed . That way , the template will be used with budget plans that use the layout .

title : Search for products and product variants during order entry
# Search for products and product variants during order entry
When you search for products or product variants , it is important to understand how the search feature finds the products that match the text that you enter . The key search rules in delivering search results are :
- Search results will return any matching record , disregarding the field that the search text is entered in .
- The search text needs to be present in the matching record in its full length .
- A match will occur even if the search text is found in the middle of a text string in the matching record . It does not have to appear in the beginning of a text string .
- The search text is treated as a single text string even if it contains white space .
If you type &apos; speak 05 &apos; you will not get any results . This is because the search looks for the full text that is entered . The search will not try to find &apos; speak &apos; and then narrow the results to those containing &apos; 05 &apos; .
# # Configure the product search
# # # Step 1 : Include all the relevant product and product variant identifiers and dimensions in the search criteria
Until the table is populated , product search will not provide the correct results . If you do not get any search results , make sure that this table is populated .
The table only has to be populated when the search criteria is modified . Newly released products and variants are automatically added to the table . Deleted products and variants are automatically removed from the table .

The rounding difference is posted to the Sales tax rounding account that is selected in the Accounts for automatic transactions field in the General ledger .
The below example illustrates how the rounding rule on Sales tax authority works .
The total sales tax for a period shows a credit balance of -98,765.43 . The legal entity collected more sales taxes than it paid . Therefore , the legal entity owes money to the tax authority .
The legal entity wants to use a rounding method that rounds the balance to the nearest 1.00 . The user who is responsible for sales tax accounting performs the following steps .
2 . On the General FastTab , select Normal in the Rounding form field .
3 . In the Round-off field , enter 1.00 .
5 . On the sales tax settlement account , the tax liability amount of 98,765.43 is rounded to 98,765 .
The following table shows how an amount of 98,765.43 is rounded by using each rounding method that is available in the Rounding form field in the Sales tax authorities page .
&gt; If you select Own advantage , the rounding is always to the advantage of the legal entity .
Delivery schedules allow you to track order line quantity when you are using multiple deliveries for a single sales order , sales quotation , or purchase order .

# # When might I want to merge batches of inventory ?
Here are some examples of scenarios where it might be useful to merge batches :
# # Can I merge batches across sites and legal entities ?
No , you can merge only batches that have the same site and warehouse storage dimensions in one legal entity . However , you can specify a different location and pallet ID for the merged batch .
# # Can I merge partial quantities ?
No , you can merge only the full quantity of batches . The batch merge functionality is intended as an inventory feature , not a production feature .
# # What if the batches have different batch attribute values ?
When you add these batches as source batches , the following values are assigned to the merged batch .
# # What if the batches have different batch dates ?
# # What if the dimensions are different on the batches that I want to merge ?
Here is how product dimensions , tracking dimensions , and storage dimensions are handled :
# # How does posting work ?
# # After I merged a catchweight item , why can ’ t I see the catchweight information in the inventory journal ?
You can merge batches of catch-weight items just like all other items . However , the catch-weight information doesn &apos;t appear in the inventory journal . We recommend that you verify the catch-weight information before you transfer the batch merge to the inventory journal .

There are three ways to attach Time and material projects and Fixed-price projects to the invoice projects :
You can create invoice proposals for the following transactions :
- Hours , expenses , and other project transactions
- Amounts that are withheld by customers on previous project invoices
- Amounts that a customer paid to you before a project is started
# # # Creating customer invoices from invoice proposals
After you create and post an invoice proposal , a customer invoice is automatically created for the transactions that are included in the invoice proposal .
Before you post an invoice proposal , you can add transactions to it or delete transactions from it . For example , you can remove expense transactions that were posted to a project , but that are not chargeable to the customer .
If your organization requires that invoice proposals be reviewed before they are posted , the invoice proposal might need to be approved through the &quot; Review project invoice proposals &quot; workflow before it is posted .
# # # Time and material projects
To invoice a Fixed-price project , you must define a billing schedule and complete the invoicing procedure .
For example , you can set up the following billing schedule :
- 20 percent when the project contract is signed
- 30 percent on first delivery
- 15 percent on second delivery
- 35 percent on final delivery
When the milestone payments are ready to be invoiced , you use the procedure for invoicing on-account amounts .
To credit an invoiced amount , you first select the invoiced amount to credit and then create a credit note . You create a credit note by following the same procedure that you would use to generate a customer invoice .

title : Weighted average date
Weighted average date is an inventory model that is based on the weighted average principle . For the weighted average principle , issues from inventory are valued at the average value of the items that are received into inventory for each day in the inventory closing period .
The following formula is used to calculate the weighted average date costing method :
During inventory close , the calculation is performed every day through the closing period , as shown in the following illustration .
- Direct settlement
- Summarized settlement
Settlements are inventory close postings that adjust the issues to the correct weighted average as of the closing date .
- Weighted average date direct settlement when the * * Include physical value * * option isn &apos;t used
- Weighted average date direct settlement when the * * Include physical value * * option is used
- Weighted average date summarized settlement when the * * Include physical value * * option is used
- Weighted average date when marking is used
# # Weighted average date direct settlement when the Include physical value option isn &apos;t used
The current version uses the same direct settlement principle that was used for weighted average in earlier versions . The system settles directly between receipts and issues . The system uses this direct settlement principle in specific situations :
- One receipt and one or several issues have been posted in the period .
- Only issues have been posted in the period , and the inventory contains on-hand items from a previous closing .
In the following scenario , a financially updated receipt and issue have been posted . During inventory close , the system settles the receipt directly against the issue , and no adjustment to the cost price is required on issue .
- 3 . Inventory close is performed by using the direct settlement method to settle the inventory financial receipt to the inventory financial issue .
- If an inventory transaction value is enclosed in parentheses , the inventory transaction is physically posted into inventory .
- If an inventory transaction value isn &apos;t enclosed in parentheses , the inventory transaction is financially posted into inventory .
- Settlements that are performed by inventory close are represented by dashed red arrows that go diagonally from a receipt to an issue .
# # Weighted average date summarized settlement when the Include physical value option isn &apos;t used
In the following scenario , several financially updated receipts and issues have been posted during the period . During inventory close , the system evaluates every day to determine how each day should be treated by closing .
The system will use the direct settlement approach for day 1 .
- 3a . Inventory physical issue for a quantity of 1 at a running average cost of USD 15.00
- 3b . Inventory financial issue for a quantity of 1 at a running average cost of USD 15.00
The system will use the direct settlement approach for day 2 .
- 4a . Inventory physical issue for a quantity of 1 at a running average cost of USD 15.00
- 5a . Inventory physical receipt for a quantity of 1 at USD 17.00 each
- 5b . Inventory financial receipt for a quantity of 1 at USD 17.00 each
Inventory close is performed . The direct settlement must be used , because there are multiple receipts that cross multiple days .
- 7b . A weighted average inventory close transaction financial receipt is created as the offset to 7a .
- Solid red diagonal arrows show the receipt transactions being settled to the issue transaction that is created by the system .
- The solid green diagonal arrow represents the offsetting system-generated receipt transaction that the originally posted issue transaction is settled to .
# # Weighted average date direct settlement when the Include physical value option is used
The current version uses the same direct settlement principle for weighted average date that is used in earlier versions . The system settles directly between receipts and issues . The system uses this direct settlement principle in specific situations :
- Only issues have been posted in the period , and the inventory contains on-hand inventory from a previous closing .
# # Weighted average date summarized settlement when the Include physical value option is used
# # Weighted average date when marking is used
The new running average cost price reflects the average of the financially and physically updated transactions at USD 27.50 . The following illustration shows this series of transactions , and the effects of using the weighted average date inventory model and marking .

You can define general default order settings and any number of default order setting rules that apply only in certain conditions , such as site or a specific product dimension or product dimensions combination . You can &apos;t define warehouse specific order settings .
# # # Rank in default order settings
# # # Default order settings for released products
# # # Site specific order settings
# # # Specific order settings for product dimension
Consider the following example product .
For this example , assume that the product is procured and not produced . Also assume that configuration C1 is more commonly used , so it has shorter lead times .
Create the following default order settings to model this scenario .
You can create the following default order settings rules .
Consider the following default order setting rules .
As a general guidance , specific rules and rules for dimensions that are more important than other dimensions get higher ranks , while more generic rules get lower ranks .
The rule with rank zero serves as a safety net . If no other rules are hit , then the default order settings from rule zero will be used .

title : Overhead calculation
This topic describes the typical processes for calculating and allocating overhead costs .
- Date and time
# # Calculate and allocate the Electricity overhead cost
# # # # Define the cost behavior rule
- Fixed amount 1,000.00
# # # # # Journal
# # # # # Cost entries
# # # Step 2 : Process the cost distribution calculation
Cost distribution is used to redistribute cost from one cost object to one or more other cost objects by applying a relevant allocation base . Cost distribution and cost allocation differ in that cost distribution always occurs at the level of the primary cost element of the original cost .
# # # # Define the cost distribution rule
The following table shows the result when electricity consumption is applied as an allocation base for variable costs .
# # # Step 3 : Process the overhead rate calculation
The overhead rate is used to charge one or more specific cost objects . The charge is based on a predetermined cost rate and the magnitude from the assigned allocation base .
# # # # Define the overhead rate
Cost object CC001 HR contributes to a set of internal projects . A statistical dimension member that is named HR projects is created to measure the consumed magnitude .
A predetermined cost rate for the cost projects contribution has been defined .
The following table shows the result when the HR projects are applied as an allocation base .
# # # Step 4 : Process the cost allocation calculation
# # # # Define the cost allocation
Here is a simple example that explains how you can trace the flow of cost . Cost object CC001 HR contributes to several cost objects . A statistical dimension member that is named HR services is created to measure the consumed magnitude .
Cost object CC002 Finance contributes to several cost objects . A statistical dimension member that is named Finance services is created to measure the consumed magnitude .
Cost object CC003 Assembly contributes to several cost objects . A statistical dimension member that is named Assembly services is created to measure the consumed magnitude .
The following table shows the result when the Finance services are applied as an allocation base for total cost ( fixed cost and variable cost ) .
The following table shows the result when the Assembly services are applied as an allocation base for total cost ( fixed cost and variable cost ) .
The following table shows the result when the Packaging services are applied as an allocation base for total cost ( fixed cost and variable cost ) .

&#91; Update standard costs in a non-manufacturing environment &#93; ( update-standard-costs-non-manufacturing-environment.md )
This topic provides information about operations scheduling . You can use operations scheduling to provide a general estimate of the production process over time .
# # Components of operations scheduling
The main components of operations scheduling are the scheduling direction , the capacity of resources , and materials optimization . By using operations scheduling , you can achieve the following goals :
- Control the planning method by scheduling forward or backward from a given date .
- Optimize the use of resources by scheduling productions based on the capacity of the resources . This approach also helps identify when alternative resources should be used .
- Optimize the use of materials by scheduling productions based on the availability of the required materials .
- Schedule and synchronize reference productions . The dates of the reference productions are adjusted when the production order ’ s schedule is changed .
You must estimate the cost of a production order before you can run operations scheduling . If you haven &apos;t run an estimate , it &apos;s automatically run before operations scheduling is started . An operations schedule specifies the following information :
- The product that is planned for production
- The quantities that are involved in the production
- The dates when the production will start and end
- The capacity reservations for the resources that perform the production activities
# # Scheduling direction and date
# # Operations scheduling and master planning
The operations schedule also drives master planning and determines calculations for material requirements . Operations scheduling considers the following information :

title : Activity-based subcontracting
This topic describes , in detail , how to use subcontracted activities in a production flow for lean manufacturing .
# # Production flows that involve subcontractors
The basic principle of a production flow doesn &apos;t change when activities are subcontracted . Material still flows between locations , process activities convert material to products , and transfer activities move material or products from one location to another . You can model locations and work cells as vendor-managed by assigning the vendor account to a warehouse or to a resource of a resource group .
Based on these capabilities , lean manufacturing doesn &apos;t require any specific features in order to support the flow of material and products . All possible scenarios that involve vendors as providers of production or transport services can be modeled based on the architecture of production flow and activities .
1 . Create a purchase agreement . The purchase agreement is created for the service and connected to the activity of the production flow .
6 . Generate an invoice .
The process ends when the subcontractor is invoiced for a period . The invoice match is done against the receipt advisories that are created . Because the receipt advisories represent the exact physical receipt of material , the three-way matching is simplified .
# # Configuring activities for subcontracting
The following sections describe how to configure activities for subcontracting .
The payment item that is used in activity-based subcontracting must be a product that has the following properties :
# # # Subcontracted process activities
To configure a process activity as a subcontracted activity , follow these steps .
# # Cost accounting of subcontracted services
The backflush costing for lean manufacturing at the end of a costing period calculates the actual variances of the products that are produced from the production flow during the costing period .

- You can control how items are stored and picked , based on query-defined rules .
# # # Location stocking limits , location profiles , and fixed picking locations
You must consider the physical layout of the warehouse , both to determine storage capacities ( location stocking limits and location profiles ) and as part of your attempts to achieve optimal warehouse processes .
If more advanced calculations are required to control the location capacity constraints , the location profile settings can be used . In this case , the weight and volume are considered when capacity calculations are done .
# # # Location setup wizard
You can create three types of wave templates :
You must specify the wave process methods in each wave template . The methods that are available vary , depending on the wave template type .
- Cycle count plans
- Cycle count thresholds
- Cycle count work by location
- Cycle count work by item
When you use work templates to create work , the work pool is automatically assigned to the work .
Work pool IDs can also be used to limit the type of work that is directed to a particular warehouse worker , provided that this functionality is configured on the relevant mobile device menu item .
As the name suggests , location directives are used to direct the work transactions to the appropriate locations in the warehouse . In other words , they define where to pick and put .

This article gives an overview of the Reducing balance method of depreciation .
When you set up a fixed asset depreciation profile and select Reducing balance in the Method field in the Depreciation profiles page , the assets that have this depreciation profile assigned to them are depreciated by the same percentage in each depreciation period .
Because an asset will never be fully depreciated based on a percentage calculation , you must select the Full depreciation option to fully depreciate an asset .
- Yearly posts on December 31 .
- Half-Yearly posts a half-yearly amount at the end of each calendar half-year ( June 30 and December 31 ) .
- Yearly posts the total amount of the depreciation calculated for the fiscal year as one amount on the last day of the fiscal year .
Suppose that the fixed asset acquisition price is 11,000 , the scrap value is 1,000 , and the depreciation percentage factor is 30 .

title : Generate consolidated financial statements
This topic describes the various scenarios where you might generate consolidated financial statements .
The simplest method for consolidating by using Financial reporting is to use reporting trees to aggregate data across companies that have the same chart of accounts and fiscal periods . Here are the high-level steps to consolidate by using a reporting tree .
1 . Create a row definition , and make sure that all appropriate accounts in all companies are included in the rows .
2 . Create a column definition that includes all the columns that are required for the report that you &apos;re creating .
3 . Create a reporting tree that includes a reporting node for each company that you &apos;re using on consolidated reports .
The following illustration shows how you can use a reporting tree definition in Financial reporting to identify each company that you will consolidate .
As the consolidated report in the following illustration shows , when you use the reporting tree together with a report definition , you can view each company separately . The consolidated amounts are shown at the summary level .
You can also create a multilevel reporting tree that includes as many levels as you require . The following illustration shows a multilevel reporting tree definition that has roll-ups by worldwide region .
The following illustration shows a multilevel reporting tree definition that has roll-ups by function .
# # # Viewing companies side by side
3 . Optional : Add headers and total columns .
The following illustration shows a column definition in a side-by-side format .
# # Consolidations that use organization structures that are created from legal entities
Organization hierarchies that contain dimensions or legal entities dynamically create reporting tree definitions in Financial reporting . An easy way to streamline consolidations is to add an organization hierarchy to your report in Financial reporting . Based on the report date , Financial reporting will select tfhe organization hierarchy on or before the effective date , as shown in the following illustration .
# # Consolidations that involve eliminations
The following illustration shows the consolidated report .
Whether you use accounts , dimensions , or both , Financial reporting lets you filter out the elimination entries by using the dimension filtering capabilities .
# # # Using the reporting tree definition
&gt; You can apply this ownership percentage to any reporting unit , not just at the company level .
# # # Showing ownership as a separate row on the consolidated report
# # Multiple charts of accounts across legal entities
1 . Create a row definition that has multiple links to financial dimensions . There should be one link for each chart of accounts .
2 . Use the reporting unit restriction in the column definition to assign each company to the appropriate column .
# # Different fiscal calendars across multiple legal entities
Different legal entities might have different fiscal calendars but still be required to produce consolidated financial statements . There are two ways to consolidate when different fiscal periods exist across legal entities :
- Create a column definition , and use the period and year to map the appropriate periods for each company .
The following illustration shows the options in the report definition that let you select whether the period number or the period end date is used for the consolidation .
# # Business unit consolidations
# # Consolidations that involve multiple reporting currencies
# # # Currency translation methods
There are four options for calculating exchange rates in Financial reporting :
( Exchange rate × Days in effect ) ÷ Days in period
Total of exchange rates ÷ Number of exchange rates
# # # Report designer options for currency translation
In Financial reporting , any report can be shown in any number of reporting currencies . The following fields in the report definition support this capability :
# # # Currency translation adjustment
# # # Balance calculation approach
To get correctly translated amounts when currencies are used , Financial reporting uses the following calculation methods for the balances :
title : Reuse product configurations
# # Use catalogs to drive sales order pricing and promotions
# # Use the source ID to track costs and response rates
It &apos;s possible to link multiple source code IDs to a catalog . This is often needed when a company wants to track the response rate by different segments . The company will give a unique catalog code to different customer segments , which allows for tracking the response rate , down to the segment level , within a particular catalog event .
# # Configure catalog-specific order and item scripts
When a call center user is creating a sales order , they can use on-screen scripts . These text-based scripts may provide additional information that the user should say to the customer , or it may be internal notes / reminders that the call center user should review and react to as they are creating the sales order .

title : Manage subcontracting work in production
# Manage subcontracting work in production
- Subcontracting of route operations in production orders or batch orders
- The service product must be a stocked product , and it must be part of the BOM .
- Semi-finished products are represented by the service product in the process .
- Cost control allocates the costs that are associated with subcontracted work to the material costs .
- Subcontracting of production flow activities in a lean production flow
- This method uses purchase agreements as service agreements .
- This method uses backflush costing .
- This method allows for aggregated and asynchronous procurement . ( Material flow is independent of the procurement process . )
- Cost control allocates subcontracted work in its own cost breakdown block .
# # Subcontracting of route operations
A production order can have many operations , and each operation can be allocated to a different vendor . Therefore , an end-to-end production order might trigger multiple purchase orders .
# # Subcontracting of production flow activities
# # # Modeling subcontracting in a production flow
# # Material supply for subcontracted operations
To replenish material at this warehouse , you can use multiple strategies :
- Transfer journals
- Withdrawal kanbans
- Direct purchase to the vendor location
Semi-finished products are the exception to this rule . To transfer semi-finished products , you &apos;re limited to these options :
- For subcontracted operations in production flows , the transfer of semi-finished products is documented by the receipt of withdrawal or production kanbans at the vendor location . To model an explicit transfer activity , you can end a production kanban with an additional transfer activity .
Typically , the output warehouse and location of a subcontracted resource group are directly allocated to the warehouse and location of the next step of the operation in the route or production flow . This setup helps reduce the amount of job reporting that occurs or the number additional transfer operations that must be modeled .

To make product 2 available at store 1 , you can add the product to assortment 1 .
Alternatively , you can add store 1 to assortment 2 .
In situations where multiple channels share the same product assortments , you can configure the assortments by using the Retail assortment organization hierarchy . When nodes from this hierarchy are added , all channels in that node and its child nodes will be included .
Similarly , on the product side , you can include groups of products by using product category hierarchies . You can configure assortments by including one or more category hierarchy nodes . In this case , the assortment will include all products in that category node and its child nodes .
# # # Excluded products or categories
&gt; If a product is both included and excluded in one or more assortments by definition , the product will always be considered excluded .
# # # Global and released products
# # # Dynamic and static assortments
Assortments can be defined with specific channels and products or by including organization units and categories . Assortments including references to these groups are considered dynamic assortments . If the definition or contents of those groups change while the assortment is active , the definition of the assortment will also change .
Assortments that are defined in Retail must be processed before they take effect . This processing is done for the following reasons :
- The products and channels in the assortment can change outside the assortment itself . Dynamic assortments that contain references to categories or organization units must be processed periodically so that they include or exclude records , based on their current assignment .
Consider the following implementation requirements as you plan and manage assortments for your retail implementation :

- Define fewer info codes and easily re-use them . Info codes that are included in info code groups have no predefined dependencies on other info codes . You can include the same info code in multiple info code groups and then use prioritization to present the same info codes in the order that makes sense in any particular situation .
- Link info codes to other info codes or info code groups to gather information about a product or transaction without having to define a separate info code or linked info code for each scenario .

title : Fixed asset depreciation
This topic provides an overview of depreciation for fixed assets .
Depreciation is a periodic transaction that typically reduces the value of the fixed asset on the balance sheet , and is charged as an expenditure to a profit and loss account . Therefore , a main account is typically used to credit the periodic depreciation on the balance sheet . An offset account is an account in the profit and loss part of the chart of accounts .
Extraordinary depreciation works independently of basic depreciation . By having extraordinary depreciation as a separate transaction type , you can post and report the extraordinary depreciation separately from the basic depreciation .
You can create an unlimited number of special depreciation allowance records . After you assign those records to an asset group book , they are applied to the asset book .
A special depreciation allowance is entered as either a percentage or a fixed amount . When you post depreciation proposals , special depreciation allowance transactions are posted to the book as transactions that are separate from the depreciation transactions .
You can create shared calendars by using the * * Fiscal calendars * * page in General ledger .

This topic provides information about project resourcing .
- Define a role that has the required competencies , so that it &apos;s easy to match resources .
- Use roles to define an initial engagement schedule that is based on reserved resources .
- Estimate costs and determine an initial budget , based on assigned roles and resources for a project .
- Use roles to estimate the number of resource reservations that are required for each engagement .
- Estimate the number of resources that are required for the whole life cycle of a project .
- Draft a work breakdown structure ( WBS ) by using the initial resource assignments .
As project planning proceeds , planned resources can be replaced with staffed resources . The project manager can also go back and update the resourcing reservations during any project stage .
# # Set up project resources
When you set up a worker as a project resource , you can select from workers who work in the company that you &apos;re setting up resources for . Alternatively , you can select workers from other companies in your organization . These workers are known as intercompany resources .
The following procedures explain how to set up a worker as a project resource in your company and how to set up an intercompany project resource .
# # # Set up a worker as a project resource

# # # Set up competencies : Certificates
# # # Set up competencies : Skills
# # Create a new project
# # # Assign a resource to a project
# # # Set up project resource and role characteristics
A project manager can use the project resourcing functionality to create the roles that are required for the project . Roles can be used if confirmed resources are still unknown when resources are being reserved . Roles can be temporarily reserved as planned resources , so that you can continue the project planning stages .
The following steps show how the resource manager can set up the Senior project manager role and associate resource characteristics with it . Later , the role can be used to search for available resources that match the required resource competencies .
# # # Assign a project resource to a project
7 . In the list of resources , select a resource .
# # # Assign a resource to a default role
# # Set up role-based pricing
All cost , sales , and transfer prices can be set up for roles .

title : Quality management overview
# # Examples of the use of quality management
Quality management is flexible and can be implemented in various ways to meet the requirements of specific levels of supply chain operations . The following examples illustrate possible uses of these features :
- Automatically start a quality control process , based on predefined criteria ( upon warehouse registration of a purchase order from a specific vendor ) .
- Block inventory during inspection to prevent non-approved inventory from being used ( full blocking of purchase order quantities ) .
- Use item sampling as part of a quality association to define the amount of current physical inventory that must be inspected . Sampling can be based on fixed quantities or a percentage .
- Create test types that include minimum , maximum , and target test values , and perform qualitative-versus-quantitative testing that has predefined validation results .
- Specify an acceptable quality level ( AQL ) to control quality measure tolerances .
- Specify the resources that an inspection operation requires , such as a test area and test instruments .
# # Working with quality associations
The business process that uses a quality association can be related to various source documents , such as purchase orders , sales orders , or production orders .

title : Running average cost price
The inventory close process settles issue transactions to receipt transactions , based on the inventory valuation method that is selected in the item ’ s item model group . However , before inventory close is run , the system calculates a running average cost price that is typically used when issue transactions are posted .
The system estimates this running average cost price for an item by using the following formula :
# # Using the running average cost price
The following table shows when the system posts inventory transactions by using the running average cost price , and when it uses the cost price that is defined on the item master record instead .
1 . You financially receive a quantity of 100 at USD 100.00 .
2 . You financially issue a quantity of 200 .
3 . You physically receive a quantity of 101 at USD 202.00 .
- You must estimate issue prices on the on-hand value and quantity .
- You must adjust the on-hand value and quantity on issues and receipts .
- Your business model allows you to send out , or price , more pieces than you have .
- You must accept any receipt value and quantity that are submitted to you .
However , if your business model allows for the following practices , they can help you avoid the negative quantities that make the pricing amplification scenario possible :

This topic introduces the concept of backflush costing that is used for Lean manufacturing .
To enable costing , you must complete the following setup :
# # Cost calculation for Lean manufacturing
# # # Calculation that is based on the route
- Kanban issues are posted for kanban picking lines that update inventory .
- Transfer jobs are completed that update inventory on pick but not receipt ( Transfer of material from inventory to WIP ) .
# # Receiving products from the production flow
Products are received from the production flow under the following conditions :
Products that are received from the production flow are deducted from WIP .
Note that material in WIP isn &apos;t visible in inventory on-hand overviews . However , it &apos;s visible in the kanban quantity overviews .
# # Consuming products in WIP
Products in WIP are consumed when the corresponding kanban handling units are emptied . A kanban empty signal doesn &apos;t produce an active costing transaction but will take effect when the next backflush costing is run . Emptied kanban handling units are no longer accounted as on-hand and therefore calculated as consumed within the period .
# # # Automatic empty registration
Scheduled or event kanbans can be set to automatic empty registration in the kanban rule :
2 . Calculate the production flow &apos;s net realized usage over the period .
3 . Clear the WIP from the realized resource consumption and products .
- Transactions are financially split to map the exact consumed quantities .
- Unused quantities in the production flow WIP remain in physically updated status .
- Financially update the inventory transactions for the completed quantities for the period .
- All direct manufacturing cost is financially updated . All kanban process jobs that are completed during the period are accumulated .
- All indirect cost calculated for the consumed material within the period is calculated and deducted from WIP . The remaining indirect cost is posted as a variance .
5 . Calculate the production variances to standard cost . The variance is calculated per cost group .
# Weighted average with physical value and marking
Weighted average is an inventory model based on the weighted average principle , where issues from inventory are valued at the average value of the items that are received into inventory during the inventory closing period , plus any on-hand inventory from the previous period .
If there is only one receipt , all issues can be settled from it and the virtual transfer will not be created .
When using weighted average , you can mark inventory transactions so that a specific item receipt is settled against a specific issue , instead of using the weighted average rule .
We recommend a monthly inventory closing when you use the weighted average inventory model .
The weighted average inventory costing method is calculated by the following formula :
Settlements are inventory close postings that adjust the issues to the correct weighted average as of the closing date . The following examples illustrate the effect of using weighted average with five different configurations :
- Weighted average direct settlement without the Include physical value option
- Weighted average summarized settlement without the Include physical value option
- Weighted average direct settlement with the Include physical value option
- Weighted average summarized settlement with the Include physical value option
- Weighted average with marking
# # Weighted average direct settlement without Include physical value
The direct settlement principle is the same used for weighted average in earlier versions . The system will settle directly between receipts and issues . The system uses this direct settlement principle in certain specific situations :
- One receipt and one or several issues has been posted in the period
- Only issues have been posted in the period and the inventory contains on-hand items from a previous closing
In the scenario in the following sections , a financially updated receipt and issue have been posted . During inventory close , the system will settle the receipt directly against the issue , and no adjustment to the cost price is needed on issue . The following transactions are illustrated in the graphic .
- 1a . Inventory physical receipt updated for a quantity of 5 at USD 10.00 each
- 1b . Inventory financial receipt updated for a quantity of 5 at USD 10.00 each
- 2b . Inventory financial issue updated for a quantity of 2 at USD 10.00 each
- 3 . Inventory close is performed using the direct settlement method to settle the inventory financial receipt to the inventory financial issue .
The following diagram illustrates this series of transactions with the effects of choosing the Weighted average inventory model and the direct settlement principle without the Include physical value option .
- An inventory transaction value enclosed in brackets indicates that the inventory transaction is physically posted into inventory .
- An inventory transaction value without brackets indicates that the inventory transaction is financially posted into inventory .
- Inventory closings are represented by a red vertical dashed line and the label Inventory Close .
- Settlements that are performed by inventory close are represented by dotted red arrows going diagonally from a receipt to an issue .
# # Weighted average summarized settlement without the Include physical value option
The following transactions are illustrated in the graphic below :
- 2a . Inventory physical receipt updated for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 12.00 each .
- 4a . Inventory physical receipt updated for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 14.00 each .
- 6a . “ Weighted average inventory close transaction ” financial issue is created to sum the settlements of all the inventory financial receipts .
- 6b . “ Weighted average inventory close transaction ” financial receipt is created as the offset to 5a .
The following diagram illustrates this series of transactions with the effects of choosing the Weighted average inventory model and the summarized settlement principle without the Include physical value option .
- Red arrows illustrate the receipt transactions being settled to the issue transaction created by the system .
- The green arrow represents the offsetting system-generated receipt transaction to which the originally posted issue transaction is settled
# # Weighted average direct settlement with the Include physical value option
The following diagram illustrates this series of transactions with the effects of choosing the Weighted average inventory model and the direct settlement principle with the Include physical value option .
# # Weighted average summarized settlement with the Include physical value option
- 5a . Inventory physical receipt updated for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 14.00 each .
- 7a . “ Weighted average inventory close transaction ” financial issue is created to sum the settlements of all the inventory financial receipts .
- 7b . “ Weighted average inventory close transaction ” financial receipt is created as the offset to 5a .
# # Weighted average with marking
A receipt transaction is marked to an issue transaction . Then , the valuation method selected for the item ’ s item model group will be disregarded and the system will settle these transactions to each other .
You can mark an issue transaction to a receipt before the transaction is posted . You can do this from a sales order line in the Sales order details page . The open receipt transactions are viewed in the Marking page .
You can mark an issue transaction to a receipt after the transaction has been posted . You can match or mark an issue transaction for an open receipt transaction for an inventoried item from a posted inventory adjustment journal .
- 6a . Inventory physical issue for a quantity of 1 at a cost price of USD 21.25 each .
- 7 Inventory close is performed . Since the financially updated transaction is marked to an existing receipt these transactions are settled to each other and no adjustment is made .
The following diagram illustrates this series of transactions with the effects of choosing the Weighted average inventory model with marking .

title : Project management and accounting
The project management and accounting functionality can be used in multiple industries to provide a service , produce a product , or achieve a result .
A project is a group of activities that is designed to provide a service , produce a product , or achieve a result . Projects consume resources and generate financial results in the form of revenues or assets .
The project management and accounting functionality can be used in multiple industries , as shown in the following illustration .
Although the following process flow is aimed toward external projects , or project that are completed for one or more customers , the functionality also applies to internal , cost-only projects .
As shown in the preceding illustration , project management and accounting can be divided into three phases :
# # # Create project quotations
# # # Create project contracts
# # # Create work breakdown structures
The degree of detail in a WBS depends on the level of accuracy that is required in estimates and the level of tracking that is required against those estimates . Projects that have very low tolerance for slippages in schedule or cost usually require a more detailed WBS , and also require diligent tracking of work progress and cost against the WBS .
# # # Create project forecasts and budgets
# # # Assign workers , categories , and resources
Here are some of the ways that you can use the resource scheduling functionality :
- Use information about a worker ’ s calendar and availability to match the worker ’ s schedule to the project calendar .
- Review a worker &apos;s availability to make sure that there are no calendar conflicts with the worker &apos;s assignments .
# # # Manage work breakdown structures
# # # Manage project forecasts and budgets
# # # Create production orders
# # # Procure products and services
The purchase and sale of items are prevalent activities in many project-focused businesses .
# # # # Purchase orders for projects
The purpose of the purchase order determines when the purchase order is consumed and , therefore , when items are charged on a project .
# # # # Sales orders for projects
In Project management and accounting , you can register the consumption of items in several ways . You can sell items or purchase items from a project , or reserve items for a project .
You can order items from the company ’ s inventory for consumption on a project . Alternatively , or you can purchase items from an external vendor . Items can be consumed on all types of projects except Time projects .
The way that you order items depends on where you &apos;re ordering them from :
&gt; The packing slip for a project-related sales order can ’ t be canceled if the items have already been marked for packing .
The following table lists the methods for ordering items and describes how the items are consumed .
&#124; Method &#124; Purpose &#124; Consumption of item transactions &#124;
# # # Process project invoices
# # # Calculate the cost to complete a project
The following table describes the methods for calculating the cost to complete a project .
At its most basic level , a project is used to group transactions that record costs , and then post these costs to the general ledger .
# # # Analyze cash flow
Use cash flow monitoring to review both the forecasted cash flows and the actual cash flows for a project . You can review cash flows while a project is in progress , or you can view the cash flows of a completed project .
By monitoring cash flows , you can evaluate a single project , use the reports to view multiple projects , and transfer project cash flows to the cash flow forecasts in the general ledger .
# # # # Cash inflow forecasting
- To use the general buffer days as a replacement for the individual buffer days , enter the average number of days between the due date and the actual payment date for customers .
Set up individual buffer days in the project ’ s contract . The days are calculated based on both the sales invoice due date and your organization ’ s experience with a customer &apos;s payment pattern .
# # # # Actual cash inflow
Actual cash inflow resembles forecasting , but you can begin your calculations from the first invoice date . Here is an example :
# # # # Cost forecasting
Based on the days that are defined , the cost payment date can differ from the project date . In this case , the cost payment date is calculated by adding the number of days from the project date to the number of days in the terms of payment .
For example , the project date of the transaction is March 5 , 2012 , and the following terms of payment are set :
Based on these settings , here is the cost payment date for each transaction type :
&gt; The due date for the purchase order is based on the vendor transaction when the project purchase order is created . The due date isn &apos;t determined by any default settings .
The cost payment date isn &apos;t calculated on buffer days . After a project is completed , when all costing and invoicing is completed , both the cost and the sales are posted to the profit and loss accounts .
# # # # Viewing the remaining budgeted amounts
# # # # Viewing the total budgeted amounts
The utilization rate is the percentage of time that a worker performs billable or productive work in a specific working period . Billable hours are the worker ’ s hours that can be charged to a specific customer .
When you calculate the utilization rate for a worker , you can calculate either the billable rate or the efficiency rate :
# # # Review project statements
- Project date / ledger date
- Print drivers might not be available on the user &apos;s device .
- The user &apos;s device might not be connected to the corporate network .
By using a dedicated host and following a few easy steps , system administrators can configure deployments so that users can print directly from business applications on network devices .
The following table describes the three primary printing scenarios in Finance and Operations applications .
2 . The Document Routing Agent queries the Azure Service Bus queue for active jobs .
3 . The document is downloaded by the Document Routing Agent and spooled to the network printer .
The client-based solution lets customers manage the scale of their printing needs . Customers who have heavy-volume printing workloads can install many Document Routing Agents to increase the number of concurrent printing operations . Alternatively , some customers require very few installations of the Document Routing Agent to handle their anticipated printing needs .
# # # Service components for network printing
The following diagram shows the basic components that help support network printing operations .
title : Return cost price and return lot ID
# Return cost price and return lot ID
To use a cost other than the current cost for returns from a customer , use one of the following methods .
# # Method 1 : Manually enter the return cost price
By default , when you add items to a return order , the items are returned to inventory at the current cost price . To specify a different return cost price , follow these steps .
# # Method 2 : Automatically generate the cost price based on the customer invoice line
This is the preferred method to use to create return lines . To use the cost of the products at the time when you sold the products to the customer , create a return order and specify a sales line to return .
6 . Register the receipt of the returned items .
7 . Post a packing slip for the returned items .

title : Product information overview
A product is primarily defined by a product number , name , and description . However , other data is also required in order to describe a product or service :
- Product type : Item or service
- Product subtype : Distinct products or product masters
- Definition of the product variant model :
- Product dimensions and dimension groups
- Association of the product with one or more categories
- Definition of the product and category attributes
- Units of measure and related conversions
- Translations for all names and descriptions
Note that , in dynamic and agile organizations , product information data changes every day . Therefore , maintenance of accurate and actual product data is a critical business process on its own .
# # Product masters and product variants
You can choose among three configuration technologies :
- The constraint-based configuration uses a product configuration model to describe all possible attributes and components that are required in order to describe all possible variants of a product in a single model . The constraints of combinations of attributes can be described through regular expressions or table-based constraints . Configuration models and configurators become more important in product information management and are used across all industries .

title : Build a product configuration model
# Build a product configuration model
The need to configure products to meet special requirements is becoming the rule rather than the exception , in both business-to-business and business-to-consumer relationships .
The key to success here is to carefully analyze the product portfolio , and to look for patterns in both product features and processes . The goal is to identify generic components that can be manufactured by the same equipment and used in all variants .
# # Building a product configuration model
A product configuration model consists of one or more components that are tied together through subcomponent relationships . Components are defined one time , and can then be used many times in one or more product configuration models . The components are the main building blocks of a product configuration model , and nearly all information about the model is related to them .
Table constraints can be user-defined or system-defined .
A user-defined table constraint is built by the user . The user selects a combination of attribute types to represent the columns of the table and then enters values from the domains of the selected attribute types to form the rows in the table constraint .
A table constraint is included in a product configuration model by referencing the table constraint definition and mapping the relevant attributes in the model to the columns in the table constraint .
Subcomponents represent the nodes in the product configuration model structure . For each subcomponent relationship , a reference must be specified to a product master that has the variant configuration technology set to constraint-based configuration .
A user requirement has all the constituents of a subcomponent . The only difference is that a user requirement isn &apos;t bound to a product master . The practical effect of this difference is that any BOM lines or route operation that are defined in the context of a user requirement are collapsed into the parent component BOM structure or route . This behavior resembles the behavior of a phantom BOM .
BOM lines are included to identify the manufacturing BOM for each component . A BOM line must reference an item , and all item properties can be set to a fixed value or mapped to an attribute .
Route operations are included to identify the manufacturing route . A route operation must reference a defined operation , and all operation properties can be set to a fixed value . All properties except resource requirements can be mapped to an attribute instead of a value .
# # Validating and testing a product configuration model
Validation of a product configuration model can occur on several levels in the model and can therefore cover various scopes . The lowest level is for a single expression constraint . In this case , validation is typically performed by the product designer to verify that the syntax of an expression is correct .
Finally , validation can be done for a complete product configuration model to verify that the complete syntax is correct , and that all naming and modeling conventions have been respected .
# # # The configuration page
# # Finalizing a model for configuration
When a product configuration model is ready to be used in configure-to-order scenarios , a version must be created . However , there are several options that can enhance the modeling experience .
The configuration UI can be modified by introducing attribute groups in one or more subcomponents . Such a grouping can highlight the relationships between specific attributes and help the configuration user identify the area of the product that is currently in focus .
One or more configuration templates can be created to speed up the configuration process . Alternatively , templates can be created to promote specific attribute combinations , such as when a sales campaign focuses on a specific set of product features .
# # Extending a product configuration model through the API
The following flow diagram outlines the process .
Product configuration API flow diagram
Product configuration can be performed from the following places :
- Item requirement line ( project )
The purpose of the configuration is to create a distinct variant of the product that meets the customer ’ s requirement . A unique configuration ID is created for each new configuration . This ID enables tracking through inventory .

A vendor invoice from a purchase order is an invoice that is produced when products or services are received according to a purchase order that was placed with a vendor . The vendor invoice contains a header , and one or more lines for items or services . A vendor invoice completes the cycle from purchase order to product receipt to vendor invoice .
There are several ways to enter a vendor invoice :
- The vendor invoice register lets you quickly enter invoices that don &apos;t reference a purchase order , so that you can accrue the expense . By using the vendor invoice approval journal , you can select those invoices and post them to the vendor balance to reverse the accrual .
- The vendor invoice journal lets you quickly enter invoices that don &apos;t reference a purchase order , in a single step .
- Together with the vendor invoice pool , the vendor invoice register lets you quickly enter invoices to accrue the expense . You can open the associated purchase orders later to post the invoice against the expense account .
# # Understanding invoice line quantities
When you open a vendor invoice from a related purchase order , invoice lines are created from the purchase order . By default , the quantities are taken from the product receipt quantity . However , you can use any of the following default behaviors :
# # Adding a line that wasn &apos;t on the purchase order
# # Submitting a vendor invoice for review
# # Matching vendor invoices to product receipts
You can enter and save information for vendor invoices , and you can match invoice lines to product receipt lines . You can also match partial quantities for a line .

An employee can be enrolled in a higher plan tier by using a worker-specific date to override the employee &apos;s default plan offering . Employees can receive a manual adjustment to their leave and absence balance at the time of plan enrollment , or HR can make a manual adjustment at any time .
A workflow can be customized and applied to time-off requests to meet the organization ’ s requirements .
Employees , their manager , and HR can view leave and absence balances . HR can use interactive reports to track plan enrollments and time-off balances by type .
title : One voucher
# # What is One voucher ?
- Enter a multiline voucher where there is no offset account .
# # Issues with One voucher
For example , you post the following multiline voucher .
# # The future of One voucher
# # Why use One voucher ?
# # # Scenarios that require One voucher
# # # Mechanism to group transactions from a business event
If an organization must view the accounting entries from a business event together , it must use One voucher .
If the Reimbursement periodic task is run from the Accounts receivable module , it creates a transaction to move the balance from a customer to a vendor . For this scenario , One voucher must be used to reimburse the customer .
The following fixed asset transactions also create multiple transactions in a single voucher :
- An additional acquisition is made on an asset , and &quot; catch-up &quot; depreciation is calculated .
- An asset is split .
- A parameter to calculate depreciation on disposal is turned on , and then the asset is disposed of .
- An asset &apos;s service date is before the acquisition date . Therefore , a depreciation adjustment is posted .
Bills of exchange and promissory notes require that One voucher be used , because the transactions move the customer or vendor balance from one Accounts receivable / Accounts payable ledger account to another , based on the state of the payment .
# # Scenarios that don &apos;t require One voucher
The following scenarios can be accomplished through other means and should not use the One voucher functionality .
# # # Post customer payments in summary form to the bank account
An organization deposits customer payments , or the bank deposits customer payments on the organization &apos;s behalf , and the deposit is shown as a lump sum on the bank account .
Summarization of customer payments is supported through the deposit functionality when &quot; bridging &quot; isn &apos;t used on the method of payment .
Netting can be accomplished by entering the increase and decrease in separate vouchers , and then posting the offset to a clearing ledger account .
# # # Post in summary to the general ledger
- After support for One voucher is removed , the Source document and Accounting frameworks can be implemented in the journals . These frameworks will then maintain the transaction details and support summarization into the general ledger .
# # # Settle multiple unposted payments to the same invoice
This scenario is typically found in retail organizations where customers can use multiple methods of payment to pay for purchases . In this scenario , the organization must be able to record multiple unposted payments and settle them against the customer invoice .
# # # Import bank statement transactions
Transactions can be grouped by using other fields on the journal , such as the journal batch number itself or the document number .
# # # Enter beginning balances
# # # Correct the accounting entry of a posted customer or vendor document
An organization might have to correct the Accounts receivable or Accounts payable ledger account for an accounting entry of a posted invoice , but that invoice can &apos;t be reversed or corrected through another mechanism .
Organizations often use the One voucher functionality merely because the system lets them use it , without understanding the implications .

This article provides information about accounting distributions and describes the options that are available for processing them . Accounting distributions are used to allocate monetary amounts for a source document to specific ledger accounts .
&gt; Some documents also support header document monetary amounts , such as charges for orders and invoices .
The generic accounting distribution capabilities provide the following options for processing accounting distributions :
- The distributions amounts are based on the term currency for the document . Typically , this currency is the transaction currency . Accounting and reporting currency amounts are generated as part of subledger accounting .
- The financial dimensions on the accounting distributions follow a defaulting pattern that a document can extended . For more details , see the related articles .

title : Single voucher with multiple customer or vendor records
# Single voucher with multiple customer or vendor records
Some common examples where one voucher is used for multiple customers or vendors include balance transfers between customers , and netting balances between customers and vendors in the same organization .
A voucher containing more than one customer or vendor can be entered using one of the following methods :
- Using a multi-line voucher , where there is no offset ledger account , with more than one customer or vendor .
This topic shows how settlement will be processed when one voucher with multiple customer or vendor records is posted . Additionally , this topic provides workarounds to help you understand how to avoid using one voucher with multiple customers or vendors . In particular , there are examples which illustrate two common settlement scenarios that are impacted by the use of one voucher with multiple customers or vendors :
# # How does settlement impact single voucher usage
# # # One voucher with multiple vendors and the impact on cash discount accounting
After posting , one voucher is created .
Now , when INV2 is paid , the following entry will be made . Notice that the cash discount ’ s financial dimensions follow the associated expense ’ s financial dimensions .
# # # One voucher with multiple vendors and the impact on realized gain / loss accounting
# # One voucher for balance transfers and netting scenarios
To illustrate , assume the following sale is made to customer ACME . The following accounting entries represent the sale .
Notice that the above entry is contained in one voucher . This voucher contains two customer records . The following voucher is created when the above General ledger entry is posted .
On the related voucher for cash discount , the default for the financial dimension comes from the customer transaction created from the transfer , because the transfer has more than one customer .
This means that when the Insurance customer pays 98.00 with voucher ARPAYM02 , the correct financial dimensions from voucher ARPAYM002 ’ s ledger account entry will be used .
On the related voucher for cash discount , the financial dimensions will be used from the offsetting revenue account shown on ARPAYM002 ’ s voucher .

title : Define expense policies
You can define policies that your workers must follow when entering and submitting expense reports and travel requisitions .
Implementing expense policies can help you manage expenses effectively .
If a worker submits an expense report or a travel requisition in which the room rate exceeds this amount , the system will notify the

A product master is the starting point for any product configuration process . For the dimension-based product configuration , you need a product master with this particular configuration technology and a product dimension group that includes the configuration product dimension .
# # # Configuration product dimension
The configuration product dimension is used to identify the product variants for a product master with the dimension-based configuration technology . The configuration dimension value is entered by the user and should help to identify the individual product variants .
Configuration groups are defined in a central repository and can be used for all dimension-based product configuration models . Configuration groups are associated to the individual BOM lines and hold together a group of lines that are mutually exclusive . This means that only one line in a group can be selected for a single product variant .
# # # Bill of materials ( BOM )
The configuration route determines the sequence of the configuration groups , as they will be displayed to the user during the product configuration process .
The configuration rules represent a mechanism for ensuring that a product included in one configuration group in a BOM enforces either an inclusion or an exclusion of a product in a different configuration group in the same BOM .
# # Product modeling process
The following eight task guides are listed in the order in which you should complete them .
title : Design questionnaires
A carefully designed questionnaire can help increase the quality of the data that you collect . Through careful design , you can better select the appropriate options at the appropriate time for a questionnaire . The following points can help you plan an effective questionnaire :
- Clearly define the purpose of the questionnaire to help guarantee that the questions support the purpose .
- Determine the individual person or the group of people who should complete the questionnaire .
- Write questions that will appear on the questionnaire , and include answer choices , if applicable .
- Arrange questions and answers in the order that they should be presented to respondents in .
- Decide how the results should be evaluated , if applicable .
The design phase includes four categories of tasks that you must complete in this order :
1 . Set up prerequisites , as required .
2 . Set up answer groups and answers , if applicable .
3 . Set up questions and their association with the answer groups .
4 . Set up the questionnaire itself , and attach questions to it .
&#124; Questionnaire parameters &#124; Modify basic controls and default settings for questionnaires . &#124;
- Review process
Question types are required and must be assigned when you create a question .
Questionnaire parameters are optional . You might not use them , depending on your company ’ s requirements .
Questionnaire parameters define the anonymity , number sequence codes , and reference types of a questionnaire . When an organization distributes a questionnaire , the option to allow respondents to remain anonymous might be of concern .
The number sequence codes are used to organize questions and answers . Based on these number sequence codes , values are automatically assigned to items .
You should define all parameters before you begin to create your data . You can modify the questionnaire parameter settings at any time .
# # # Answer groups and answers
Respondents can answer a question in two ways , depending on the subject of the question :
- Closed-ended questions require that the respondent select an answer in a list of possible correct answers .
An answer group can be used for more than one question on the same questionnaire , and can also be used on more than one questionnaire .
A questionnaire must contain questions . Questions can be either open-ended or closed-ended .
Questions can be arranged in a conditional question hierarchy , so that secondary questions depend on the answer that the respondent selects for the previous question . You can write the questions first and then arrange them into a hierarchy later .
For each questionnaire , you can specify the following information :
- The total time or time limit to answer mandatory questions .
- Whether all questions are mandatory .
- Whether to calculate points on a questionnaire .
- How to categorize results .
- Whether the questionnaire will be available to a restricted set of respondents .
- Whether a form template should be displayed as a background behind each page of the questionnaire .
- Whether additional notes are required in order to clarify the intent of the questionnaire for the respondents .
- Whether to display questions in a fixed order or randomly select them from a pool .
- Whether questions will be asked only if specific responses are given for previous answers .
# # # Set up a questionnaire
1 . Create a questionnaire .
2 . Follow one of these steps to attach questions to the questionnaire :
- If you aren &apos;t using result groups , you can attach questions directly to the questionnaire .
3 . Set up a conditional question hierarchy , if it &apos;s required .
# # # Modify a questionnaire
You can complete the following tasks on the * * Questionnaires * * page :
- Modify information in the questionnaire , such as the result groups and questions .
- Make changes in the result groups and sequence number .
In a questionnaire , you can &apos;t delete the following types of questions :
- Questions that are attached to a questionnaire
- Questions that have already been answered and therefore appear in the * * Answers * * dialog box .
Result groups are optional when you attach questions to a questionnaire .
A result group is used to calculate points and categorize the results of a questionnaire . If you use result groups , you can perform the following tasks :
- Evaluate questionnaire results , based on point statistics .
- Evaluate a respondent ’ s score for each result group that you set up .
- Generate statistics for each result group to help you analyze results .
- Print a report that shows results for each result group , and also optional points / texts that are based on points that are earned in each result group .
- Define points for answers in the answer groups that are assigned to each question .
- Set up a questionnaire .
Because a result group is related to the points that are associated with specific sets of questions on a questionnaire , you can use only a specific result group for a questionnaire .
You &apos;re using a questionnaire for a leadership test that has 15 questions in three categories . You create three result groups and add five questions to each result group . Points are then totaled in the three groups . The three result groups are as follows :
- Creative abilities
- Technical abilities
The following table shows the point-based messages that you define for the “ leadership abilities ” result group .
You can set up point intervals and texts for each result group on a questionnaire . Texts that correspond to each respondent ’ s score are displayed for each result group .
Conditional question hierarchies are optional when you set up a questionnaire .

title : SEPA direct debit overview
A SEPA direct debit allows a creditor to collect funds from a customer ’ s bank account , provided that a signed mandate has been granted by the customer to the creditor . The customer signs a mandate that authorizes the creditor to collect a payment and instructs the customer ’ s bank to pay the collection .
# # What is the Core Direct Debit scheme ?
The SEPA Core Direct Debit Scheme is the basic scheme . It has the following attributes :
- The transfer of funds is in euros ( even though the bank accounts may hold funds in other currencies ) .
- The customer and creditor must each hold an account with a credit institution that is located within the SEPA .
- The customer must grant a signed mandate to the creditor .
- Mandates expire 36 months after the last initiated collection .
- The creditor must store mandates for as long as the mandate is valid and for at least 14 months after the last collection .
- The scheme may be used for single ( one-time ) or recurring direct debit collections .
- Customers have a “ no questions asked ” right to receive a refund for up to eight weeks after the debit of their account .
The SEPA B2B Direct Debit Scheme applies to business-to-business transactions and builds on the SEPA Core Direct Debit Scheme . The main differences are :
- The SEPA B2B Direct Debit Scheme is not allowed when the customer is a private individual ( consumer ) .
- Customer banks must make sure that that the collection is authorized , by verifying the collection against mandate information . Customer banks and customers are required to agree on the verification that will be performed for each direct debit .
- The scheme offers a shorter timeline for presenting direct debits and reduces the return period .
# # Can I use the COR1 scheme for direct debit mandates ?
# # Where do I enter creditor identifiers ( Direct debit IDs ) ?
# # What are mandates ?
The customer signs a mandate that authorizes the creditor to collect a payment and instructs the customer ’ s bank to pay the collection . The customer can issue the mandate in paper form or electronically . By default , the mandate expires 36 months after the direct debit is last initiated .
The SEPA data formats are based on the ISO 20022 message standards . You will check the Generic electronic reporting checkbox and select the SEPA Direct debit format as an export format configuration when you configure accounts receivable methods of payment . You use that method of payment when you generate a payment file in a customer payment journal .
# # In what file formats can I generate SEPA direct debit payment files ?
You can generate electronic payment files for SEPA direct debits in the following formats :
# # How do refunds and returns work with SEPA direct debits ?

Master data is shared among operating units .
Module parameters are shared among operating units .
Each legal entity has its own fiscal calendar . If your internal organizations use different fiscal years and fiscal calendars , you must model the organizations as legal entities .
Operating units must share a fiscal calendar . If your internal organizations can use the same fiscal years and fiscal calendars , you can model the organizations as operating units .
You must consolidate the financial results for regional offices into a single , consolidated company in order to prepare financial statements .
Consolidation is not required , because data is already shared among operating units .
Centralized payments must be set up so that invoices for all child legal entities can be paid to or from a single parent legal entity .
Centralized payments are not required because all invoices are recorded in a single legal entity .
If you model the regional office as a legal entity , you have the following options :
- Headquarters creates a journal entry to cross-charge the regional office for the expense . The transactions cannot be aged .
- The invoice and payment follow the regulatory requirements of headquarters . Headquarters can create an intercompany sub-ledger transaction .
If you model the regional office as an operating unit , headquarters enters an expense transaction and codes it to the regional office .
If your organizations can use a single functional currency , you can model the organizations as operating units . Operating units must share a functional currency . However , you can enter transactions and create reports in multiple currencies .
Number sequences for some references can be set up per legal entity . Some number sequences can be shared .
Number sequences for some references can be set up per operating unit . Some number sequences can be shared .
Product definitions are shared , and they must be released to individual legal entities before they can be included in transactions . Each legal entity has its own set of released products that can be included in transaction documents . If your internal organizations must use different sets of products , you must model the organizations as legal entities .
All operating units share the same set of products . If your internal organizations can share the same set of products , you can model the organizations as operating units .
You must manually change companies to enter transactions and perform inquiries in multiple legal entities . Because of data security boundaries , consolidated inquiry and reporting can be resource intensive and time-consuming .
You do not need to change companies to access data from multiple operating units . Consolidated inquiry and reporting and individual regional inquiry is easier and faster .
# # Best practices for modeling organizations and hierarchies
Consider the following best practices when you implement an organization hierarchy :
- Model multiple hierarchies for operating units if you have complex requirements for reporting profit and loss .
- In a single legal entity , do not model multiple hierarchies for the same hierarchy purpose .
- Do not model a separate hierarchy of operating units if the structure for legal entities is also your operating structure . A mixed hierarchy of legal entities and operating units may serve both purposes .
- Before you model major restructuring scenarios , use the hierarchy &apos;s effective dates to perform an impact analysis and a validation test .
- Use draft mode to change a hierarchy before you publish a new version in a production environment .
- Limit the number of people who have permissions to add or remove organizations from a hierarchy in a production environment . A smaller number reduces the chance that costly mistakes can occur and corrections must be made .

Parameters control the general behavior in Fixed assets .
Fixed asset groups let you group your assets and specify default attributes for every asset that is assigned to a group . Books are assigned to fixed asset groups . Books track the financial value of a fixed asset over time by using the depreciation configuration that is defined in the depreciation profile .
# # Fixed asset posting profiles
# # Fixed asset groups
The last step is to update the fixed asset parameters .
You can configure reason codes so that they are required for changes to a fixed asset or for specific fixed asset transactions .
Master scheduling uses coverage settings to calculate item requirements .
You can specify coverage settings in several ways :
title : Include physical value
You use the Include physical value check box on the Inventory model FastTab of the Item model groups page to specify whether physically updated transactions are considered when the running average cost price is calculated for an item .
The * * Include physical value * * check box has the following values .
&#124; Selected &#124; Both physically updated transactions and financially updated transactions are used to calculate the running average cost price . &#124;
&#124; Cleared &#124; Only financially updated transactions are used to calculate the running average cost price . &#124;
The check box has slightly different effects , depending on the inventory model that you use .
- A purchase order for a quantity of 2 and a cost price of USD 10.00 that has been packing slip – updated
- A purchase order for a quantity of 3 and a cost price of USD 12.00 that has been invoice-updated

# Create a budget from transaction accounts and total accounts
This article provides an overview of the process for creating budgets based on total accounts . It also explains how to turn on budget control for total accounts , if budget control is required .
When a budget is used in reporting , such as on a financial statement , the budget sum for the total account consists of the following amounts :
- The budgets that are created from each transaction ledger account in the interval of the total account .
- The budget amount that is entered directly on the total account .
Therefore , you can create separate budgets for the most significant transaction accounts in the interval of the total account , and then add the available budget amount to the total account .

3 . Add a stop condition , and close the page .
Expenses that are related to workers often make up a large proportion of an organization &apos;s costs . Position forecasting lets you plan those expenses and include them in the planning of budgets .
# # Position forecasting in budget planning
Position forecasting uses three main components to provide accurate budget amounts for position expenses . These amounts can then be brought into a budget plan for budget calculations .
# # # Position forecasting processes
You can create additional forecast position versions as budget plans are revised . These new versions provide a basis for the revisions .
# # # Budget cost elements
If the cost element is based on a percentage , you must specify the budget cost elements that are used as the basis for the calculation .
Finally , Jodi adds all the earning cost elements that are used for base pay as calculation bases . Her budget cost element is now ready to be used .
Compensation groups can be used to group forecast position that have similar compensation attributes . They can also be used to define a forecast position ’ s earnings and annual increases , and to assign a set of common budget cost elements .
# # # Creating forecast positions for existing positions
# # # Creating new forecast positions
You can create new forecast positions in two ways : by copying an existing forecast position and by creating a completely new forecast position .
# # Working with forecast positions
# # # Multiple versions of a forecast position
# # # Modifying forecast positions
# # # # Budget cost elements
# # # # Generating increases
The end date of the current earnings budget cost element is updated with the day before the increase date . The recalculation process is automatically used when increases are generated . Therefore , you don &apos;t have to recalculate manually .
# # # # Changes from other pages
The recalculation process is automatically used on any forecast position that has changed .
# # Bringing forecast positions into budget plans
# # # Generating a budget plan from forecast positions
You can select a budget plan FTE scenario to include the number of FTEs in the budget plan . You can select only scenarios of the quantity type that are included in the layout of the target budget plan . When you select an FTE scenario is , you must also specify an FTE main account . This account is used to create the quantity budget plan lines .
The budget planning process and budget plan scenario that are selected in the source determine the target scenario budget planning process and scenario . Because these attributes are assigned to forecast positions , they must be in synchronized with the budget plan . Therefore , the attributes can &apos;t be edited on the target .
As for other generation processes , three options are available :
# # # Selecting forecast positions
# # # # Date options
# # # # Changing budget plan lines that have forecast positions

title : &quot; About Searching and Filtering in Business Central &quot;
This article answers common questions you might have about searching and filtering .
# # Is there a difference between searching and filtering ?
- Search is simple and broad : it matches records that contain the search text across any visible fields on the page , and is case insensitive .
# # Is the filter pane available on all lists ?
# # How can I save my filters ?
Your filters and adjustments to predefined filters are remembered throughout the session ( while you remain logged in ) , even if you navigate away from the page . It is currently not possible to permanently save filters .
Unlike filters , search text is not remembered when you navigate away from a page .
# # Can I search and filter using the companion apps and Outlook AddIn ?
On different form factors such as mobile devices or in Outlook , you can search in lists but cannot filter on individual fields in most cases .
# # Is the filter pane available for filtering reports ?

If you want to post an entry on the last day of every month , you can do one of the following :
This field determines the date on which the line will be posted for the last time . The line will not be posted after this date .
The advantage of using the field is that the line will not be deleted from the journal immediately and you can always replace the present expiration date with a later one so that you can use the line further into the future .
If the field is blank , the line will be posted every time you post until it is deleted from the journal .
# # # Allocating Recurring Journal Amounts to Several Accounts
Just as in a recurring journal , you need to enter an allocation only once . The allocation will remain in the allocation journal after posting , so you do not need to enter amounts and allocations every time you post the recurring journal line .

When you have finished saving the standard item journal , the Item Journal page is displayed so you can proceed to post it , knowing that it can easily be recreated next time you need to post the same or similar lines .

# Set Up Work Centers and Machine Centers
The program distinguishes between three types of capacities . These are arranged hierarchically . Each level contains the subordinate levels .
The top level is the work center group . Work centers are assigned to the work center groups . Every work center can only belong to one work center group .
You can assign various machine centers to every work center . A machine center may only belong to one work center .
# # To set up a work center
# # Example - Different Machine Centers Assigned to a Work Center
It is important to plan which capacities are to make up the total capacity when setting up the machine centers and work centers .
If capacities of work centers are to make no contribution to the total capacity , you can achieve this with efficiency = 0 .
# # To set up a capacity constrained machine or work center
You must set up production resources that you regard as critical and mark them to accept a finite load instead of the default infinite load that other production resources accept . A capacity-constrained resource can be a work center or machine center that you have identified as a bottleneck and would like to establish a limited , finite load for .
&gt; In case of operation splitting , the setup time is only assigned once because it is assumed that some manual adjustment is done to optimize the schedule .

# Pick Items with Inventory Picks
&gt; When picking and shipping sales line quantities that are assembled to the order , you must follow certain rules when creating the inventory pick lines . For more information , see the “ Handling Assemble-to-Order Items in Inventory Picks ” section .
You can create an inventory pick in three ways :
- Create the inventory pick directly from the source document itself .
# # To request an inventory pick by releasing the source document
For sales orders , purchase return orders , and outbound transfer orders , you create the warehouse request by releasing the order . The following describes how to do this from a sales order .
After the warehouse request has been created , a warehouse employee assigned to picking items can see that the source document is ready to be picked and can create a new pick document based on the warehouse request .
# # To create an inventory pick based on the source document
Now that the request is created , the warehouse employee can create a new inventory pick based on the released source document .
# # To create an inventory pick from the source document
# # To create multiple inventory picks with a batch job
&gt; If picking and shipping sales line quantities that are assembled to the order you should follow certain rules when creating the inventory pick lines . For more information , see the “ Handling Assemble-to-Order Items in Inventory Picks ” section .
# # To record the inventory picks
The posting process will post the shipment of the source document lines that have been picked , or in the case of production orders , the posting process will post the consumption . If the location uses bins , the posting will also create warehouse entries to post the bin quantity changes .

# Troubleshooting Integration with Microsoft Flow - Request URL Too Long
For a flow to trigger , it looks for changes in your data . When determining if your data has changed , the connectors compare the cached data to the new data requested from the source .
If the data request creates a URL that is too long , it will fail . Common causes may include :
- Generally , any source table with over 250 rows
- Source tables containing multiple thousands of records
Follow these steps as a workaround .
1 . Choose to edit the flow that is failing .
For example , if the table that you are using as a data source has 4,000 records , enter 4,000 as the number of records to skip .
&gt; The connector is currently in Beta . Updates to how data changes are targeted for a future release .

# The Dynamics GP Data Migration Extension
# # What &apos;s New in the October 2018 Release
In the migration wizard , you can now choose how you want to migrate the Dynamics GP chart of accounts . You can migrate the existing chart of accounts , or you can create a new chart of accounts based on the existing chart of accounts .
If you choose to create a new chart of accounts , you will get an additional account information page in the wizard so that you can download the workbook , make the relevant changes , and then import the workbook again to change your accounts .
With the change to the mapping of the chart of account options , you will also note a change to the type of data that comes across into the general journal for the account numbers .
- If you choose to use the existing account numbers , we will bring over the beginning balance of the main segment ( new account number ) as a summation of the main account number at the time of the migration .
Inventory items are imported with the cost valuation method that was selected when the company setup wizard was run . Service items are automatically assigned the FIFO valuation method . Currently we bring in the Quantity on Hand for the items at the time of migration . This quantity is brought into the blank location .
title : Using the C5 Data Migration Extension &#124; Microsoft Docs
# The C5 Data Migration Extension
# # What Data is Migrated ?
The following data is migrated for each entity :
* Customer dimensions ( department , center , purpose )
* Customer posting setup
* Open transactions ( customer ledger entries )
* Vendor dimensions ( department , center , purpose )
* Vendor posting setup
* Open transactions ( vendor ledger entries )
* Item dimensions ( department , center , purpose )
* Open transactions ( item ledger entries )
&gt; If there are open transactions that use foreign currencies , the exchange rates for those currencies are also migrated . Other exchange rates are not migrated .
* Standard dimensions : Department , Cost Center , Purpose
* Historical G / L transactions
# # Viewing the Status of the Migration
&gt; While you are waiting for the results of the migration , you must refresh the page to display the results .
To help avoid double-posting to the general ledger , the following balance accounts are used for open transactions :
* For vendors , we use the A / P account from the vendor posting group .
* For customers , we use the A / R account from the customer posting group .
* For items , we create a general posting setup where the adjustment account is the account specified as the inventory account on the inventory posting setup .
&gt; If you have items that are included in a BOM , you might need to migrate more than once if the original item is not created before the variants that reference it . If an item variant is created first , the reference to the original item can cause an error message .

# Design Details : Posting Date on Adjustment Value Entry
First the concept of the process is reviewed , how the batch job identifies and assigns the Posting Date to the Value Entry to be created . Thereafter there are some scenarios shared that we in the support team come across from time to time and finally there is a summary of the concepts used from version 3.0 .
1 . Initially the Posting Date of the entry to be created is the same date as the entry it adjusts .
2 . The Posting Date is validated against Inventory Periods and / or General Ledger Setup .
Let ’ s review this process more in practice . Assume we have an Item Ledger Entry of Sale . The item was shipped on September 5th , 2013 and it was invoiced the day after .
The second Value Entry ( 381 ) represents the invoice .
Step 2 : Validation of initial assigned Posting Date .
Let ’ s review the above mentioned Sale by adding setup of allowed posting date ranges .
First allowed posting date is the first day in the first open period . September 1st , 2013 .
First allowed posting date is the date stated in field Allow Posting From : September 10th , 2013 .
If both Inventory Periods and allowed posting dates in General Ledger Setup are defined , the later date of the two will define the allowed posting date range .
Step 3 : Assignment of an allowed posting date ;
We have now reviewed the concept for assigning Posting Dates to Value Entries created by the Adjust Cost - Item entries batch job .
Let ’ s continue to review some scenarios that we in the support team comes across from time to time in relation to assigned Posting Dates in the Adjust Cost – Item entries batch job and related setups .
This is a scenario where a user is experiencing mentioned error message when the Adjust Cost – Item entries batch job is run .
In the previous section , describing the concept of assigning posting dates , the intention of the Adjust Cost – Item entries batch job is to create a Value Entry with Posting Date September 10th .
We follow up on the User Setup :
The user in this case has an allowed posting date range from September 11th to September 30th and is thereby not allowed to post the Adjustment Value Entry with Posting Date September 10th .
# # # Revaluation scenario :
- Automatic Cost Posting = Yes
- Automatic Cost Adjustment = Always
- Average Cost Calc . Type = item
- Average Cost Period = Day
- Allow Posting From = January 1st , 2014
- Allow Posting From = December 1st , 2013 .
# # # # # To test the scenario
Base unit of measure = PCS
Costing Method = Average
Select optional posting groups .
2 . Open Item Journal , create and post a line as follows :
Posting Date = December 15th , 2013
Entry Type = Purchase
3 . Open Item Journal , create and post a line as follows :
Date = December 20th , 2013
Entry Type = Negative Adjustment
4 . Open Item Journal , create and post a line as follows :
Date = January 15th , 2014
5 . Open Revaluation Journal , create and post a line as follows :
Applies-to Entry = select Purchase entry posted at step 2 . The Posting Date of the revaluation will be the same as the entry it adjusts .
Unit Cost Revalued = 40
The following Item Ledger and Value Entries have been posted :
The Adjust Cost – Item entries batch job has recognized a change in cost and adjusted the Negative Adjustments .
To achieve adjustment in December of the Negative Adjustment in step 3 , the General Ledger Setup , Allow Posting From field , need to state a date in December .
# # # Item charge scenario :
2 . Create new purchase order
On the purchase order line :
Item = CHARGE
Direct Unit Cost = 100
Post Receive and Invoice .
3 . Create new sales order :
Posting Date = December 16th , 2013
On the sales order line :
Post Ship and Invoice .
Allow Posting From = January 1st , 2014
Allow Posting To = blank
5 . Create new purchase order :
Posting Date = January 2nd , 2014
Item Charge = JB-FREIGHT
Direct Unit Cost = 3
Assign Item Charge to Purchase Receipt from step 2 .
Create new purchase order :
Posting Date = December 30th , 2013
Assign Item Charge to Purchase Receipt from step 2
Inventory Valuation report is printed as of Date December 31st , 2013
# # History of Adjust Cost – Item entries batch job
Below is a summary of the concept assigning Posting Dates to Adjustment Value Entries by the Adjust Cost – Item entries batch job since version 3.0 .
In the request form of the Adjust Cost - Item Entries batch job there is a Posting Date to be entered by the user . The batch job runs through all necessary changes and creates value entries with the posting date entered in the request form . Suggested posting date to use is today ’ s date .
# # # From version 5.0 :
# # History of Post Inventory cost to G / L batch job
The Post Inventory Cost to G / L batch job is closely related to the Adjust Cost – Item entries batch job why the history of this batch job is summarized and shared here as well .
In the request form of the Post Inventory Cost to G / L there is a Posting Date to be entered by the user . The batch job runs through all value entries within the filter , if any , and creates General Ledger Entries with Posting Date entered in the request form .
Any feedback to how this process and documentation can be further developed is very welcome .

# # To migrate customer data
The following procedure is based on an Excel worksheet that you have created for migration . For more information , see the &quot; To export data migration files &quot; section .
1 . In Excel , open the exported data file . There is a worksheet with the name of the table .
2 . Rename Sheet1 to indicate that the worksheet will be used to transform the data . Copy the header row without its formatting from the exported table to the new worksheet .
3 . On a third worksheet , copy all your customer data . Rename the sheet to be called e.g. Legacy Data .
4 . Make an Excel formula to map data in the transformation worksheet between the fields in the exported worksheet and customer legacy data .
5 . When you have mapped all of the data , copy the range of data onto the table worksheet .
6 . Save the file and make sure that you do not change the file type .
# # To import customer data
&gt; In most cases , invalid data is not created in the database . However , the application can occasionally be blocked if an imported migration table contains errors .
You are now ready to apply the customer ’ s data to the database .

# Design Details : Central Concepts of the Planning System
Another goal of the planning system is to ensure that the inventory does not grow unnecessarily . If demand decreases , the planning system will suggest that the user postpone , decrease in quantity , or cancel existing supply orders .
Note that the planning system includes no dedicated logic for capacity leveling or fine scheduling . Therefore , such scheduling work is performed as a separate discipline . The lack of direct integration between the two areas also means that substantial capacity or schedule changes will require that the planning is rerun .
To avoid a supply plan that incorporates open orders in the past and suggests potentially impossible actions , the planning system treats all dates before the planning starting date as a frozen zone where the following special rule applies :
In other words , it assumes that the plan for the past is executed according to the given plan .
# # Dynamic Order Tracking ( Pegging )
Accordingly , Dynamic Order Tracking can be considered a tool that assists the user in assessing whether to accept supply order suggestions . From the supply side , a user can see which demand has created the supply , and from the demand side , which supply should cover the demand .
In companies with a low item flow and less advanced product structures , it may be adequate to use the Dynamic Order Tracking as the main means of supply planning . However , in busier environments , the planning system should be used to ensure a properly balanced supply plan at all times .
# # # Dynamic Order Tracking versus the Planning System
At a quick glance , it may be difficult to differentiate between the planning system and Dynamic Order Tracking . Both features display output in the planning worksheet by suggesting actions that the planner should take . However , the way this output is produced differs .
After the planning run , no action messages remain in the Action Message Entry table , because they have been replaced by the suggested actions in the planning worksheet
# # Sequence and Priority in Planning
When establishing a plan , the sequence of the calculations is important to get the job done within a reasonable timeframe . In addition , the prioritization of requirements and resources play an important role in obtaining the best results .
# # # Item Priority / Low-Level Code
# # # Locations / Transfer-Level Priority
In principle , any item can be handled at any location , but the program ’ s approach to the location concept is quite strict . For example , a sales order at one location cannot be fulfilled by some quantity on stock at another location . The quantity on stock must first be transferred to the location specified on the sales order .
# # Demand Forecasts and Blanket Orders
Forecasts and blanket orders both represent anticipated demand . The blanket order , which covers a customer ’ s intended purchases over a specific period of time , acts to lessen the uncertainty of the overall forecast . The blanket order is a customer-specific forecast on top of the unspecified forecast as illustrated below .
The planning system monitors such events and assigns the appropriate items for planning .
- Calculate Regenerative Plan – Calculates all selected items , whether it is necessary or not .
- Calculate Net Change Plan – Calculates only those selected items that have had some change in their demand-supply pattern and , therefore , have been assigned for planning .
In addition to these considerations , the planning system only plans for those items that the user has prepared with appropriate planning parameters . Otherwise , it is assumed that the user will plan the items manually or semi-automatically by using the Order Planning feature .
Demand and supply can carry variant codes and location codes that must be respected when the planning system balances demand and supply .
Instead of calculating any theoretical combination of variant and location , the program calculates only those combinations that actually exist in the database .
An order-to-order link between demand and supply is another type of attribute that affects the planning system .
Certain attributes on demand are specific and must be matched exactly by a corresponding supply . The following two specific attributes exist :
- Links to supply orders created manually or automatically for a specific demand ( order-to-order links ) .
For these attributes , the planning system applies the following rules :
- Demand with specific attributes can only be fulfilled by supply with matching attributes .
- Supply with specific attributes can also satisfy demand that does not ask specifically for those attributes .
Accordingly , if a demand for specific attributes cannot be met by inventory or projected supplies , the planning system will suggest a new supply order to cover this specific demand with no regard of planning parameters .
Another special case that uses order-to-order links is when an assembly order is linked to a sales order in an assemble-to-order scenario .
Order-to-order links are applied between demand and supply in four ways :
- When the planned item uses the reordering policy Order .
- When using the manufacturing policy Make-to-Order to create multi-level or project-type production orders ( producing needed components on the same production order ) .
- When assembling an item to a sales order . ( Assembly Policy is set to Assemble-to-Order .
When order-to-order links exist , the planning system does not involve linked supply or inventory in the balancing procedure . It is up to the user to evaluate if the linked supply should be used to cover other or new demand and , in that case , delete the supply order or reserve the linked supply manually .
Reservations and order tracking links will break if a situation becomes impossible , such as moving the demand to a date earlier than the supply . However , the order-to-order link adapts to any changes in the respective demand or supply and thereby the link is never broken .
The planning system does not include any reserved quantities in the calculation . For example , if a sales order has been totally or partially reserved against the quantity in inventory , the reserved quantity in inventory cannot be used to cover other demand . The planning system does not include this demand-supply set in its calculation .
However , the planning system will still include reserved quantities in the projected inventory profile because all quantities must be considered when determining both when the reorder point has been passed and how many to reorder to reach and not exceed the maximum inventory level . Consequently , unnecessary reservations will lead to increased risks that inventory levels run low because the planning logic does not detect reserved quantities .
The following illustration shows how reservations can hinder the most feasible plan .
- When the inventory is negative on the planning starting date .
- When back-dated supply or demand events exist .
The exception warning is displayed if the projected available inventory drops below the safety stock quantity . The planning system will suggest a supply order to meet the demand on its due date . The warning text states the item ’ s safety stock quantity and the date on which it is violated .
The attention warning is displayed in three situations :
The field can be manually set by the user , however , in some cases it will be set automatically by the system . The fact that planning flexibility can be manually set by the user is important , because it makes it easy to adapt the usage of the feature to different workflows and business cases .
Dampener time can be added to resources to minimize operation splitting . This enables the system to schedule load on the last possible day by exceeding the critical load percent slightly if this can reduce the number of operations that are split .

When you configure companies using RapidStart Services , there are some tips and tricks that you can take advantage of to help your implementation go smoothly .
# # Take advantage of configuration templates
Configuration templates can help you streamline your implementation process . By using them , you can include similar customers in segments and then develop an implementation protocol that treats all customers in a segment in a similar manner . In that way , you can apply a level of preconfiguration to each segment and continue with a rapid implementation .
To aid the process of filling out a configuration questionnaire , consider defining default answers to indicate best practices .
# # Batch creation of journal lines
We recommend that you use the data migration tools provided to migrate journal entries . Otherwise , if you use a batch job to create journal lines , that has a limited scope and only generates pre-default fields into a journal . The rest of the journal then has to be completed manually .
We recommend that you migrate opening balances in the following order .
2 . Migrate open customer ledger entries .
3 . Migrate open item ledger entries .
4 . Migrate open fixed asset entries .

# Correct or Cancel Unpaid Sales Invoices
You can correct or cancel a posted sales invoice . This is useful if you make a mistake or if the customer requests a change .
When you correct or cancel a posted sales invoice , the corrective sales credit memo is applied to all general ledger and inventory ledger entries that were created when the initial sales invoice was posted . This reverses the posted sales invoice in your financial records and leaves the corrective posted sales credit memo for your audit trail .

title : Create a Sales Order and Sell Products &#124; Microsoft Docs
You create a sales order or sales invoice to record your agreement with a customer to sell certain products on certain delivery and payment terms .
After the customer has confirmed the agreement , for example after a quote process , you can send an order confirmation to record your obligation to deliver the products as agreed .
You can fill customer fields on the sales order in two ways depending on whether the customer is already registered . See steps 2 and 3 in the following procedure .
# # To create a sales order
Several fields on the sales order are now filled with information that you specified on the new customer card .
You are now ready to fill in the sales order lines with inventory items or services that you want to sell to the customer .
The price and line amounts are shown with or without sales tax depending on what you selected in the * * Prices Including Tax * * field on the customer card .
The totals under the lines are automatically calculated as you create or modify lines .
You are now ready to fill in the sales order lines for products that you are selling to the customer or for any transaction with the customer that you want to record in a G / L account .
You leave the * * No . * * field empty in the following cases :
The related item and customer ledger entries are now created in your system , and the sales order is output as a PDF document . When the sales order is fully posted , it is removed from the list of sales orders and replaced with new documents in the list of posted sales invoices and the list of posted sales shipments .

# # To post a service order
4 . When you post the order , you must specify one of the following options for how you want to post the order .
You can post consumption only if the line contains a quantity that has shipped but not invoiced or consumed .
When posting the order , the corresponding ledger entries and posted documents are created . The relevant fields are updated in the service order document .
# # To batch post service orders
# # To post a service credit memo
When you have created a service credit memo and filled it in , you can post the credit memo . If there are errors or a lack of information on the credit memo while posting , the process will be interrupted by an error message .
3 . Fill in the necessary fields .
# # To post consumption from a service order
2 . Open the service order to post consumption for .
# # To post shipments from service orders
The following procedure shows how to post shipment of service line items in locations that are not set up to require warehouse handling .
You can cancel the consumption on the service orders . For example , because it was posted by mistake .
2 . Open the posted service shipment for which the erroneous consumption was posted .
A balancing service shipment line is inserted with negative values in the quantity fields for the selected lines .
&gt; You cannot undo service consumption if :
&gt; * The service order has been closed .
&gt; * It has been posted to the Jobs area , so there are job ledger entries linked to it .
# # To post service lines
The following procedure describes shipment posting directly from a service order in locations without warehouse handling set up . If the location is set up to require warehouse handling , then shipment posting happens in a different warehouse document , depending on the location setup .
- Specify general ledger accounts for posting exchange rate adjustments .
- Specify the exchange rate adjustment method for all general ledger accounts .
- Specify the exchange rate adjustment method for VAT entries .
- Activate the additional reporting currency .
For each general ledger account , you must specify how general ledger amounts for that account will be adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations between LCY and the additional reporting currency .
# # # To specify the exchange rate adjustment method for all general ledger accounts
# # # To specify exchange rate adjustment method for VAT entries

Managing receivables includes checking whether amounts due are paid on time . If customers have overdue payments , you can begin by sending the Customer Statement report as a reminder . Alternatively , you can issue reminders .
After you have created reminders and made any needed modifications , you can either print test reports or issue the reminders , typically as email .
When a customer does not pay by the due date , you can have finance charges calculated automatically and add them to the overdue amounts on the customer &apos;s account . You can inform customers of the added charges by sending finance charge memos .
&gt; You use finance charge memos to calculate interest and finance charges and to inform your customers about interest and finance charges without reminding them of overdue payments . Alternatively , you can calculate interest on overdue payments when you create reminders .
After you have created finance charge memos and made any needed modifications , you can either print test reports or issue the finance charge memos , typically as email .

# Create Custom Company Configuration Packages
As you grow your business , you will likely come to rely on a set of company types that you use with most of your customers . You can streamline your implementation process by turning these types into company configuration packages that are available for reuse .
In general , create a configuration package per functional area , for example , create a package for your manufacturing functionality . That lets you apply and set up new areas in a company as you need them
Another approach would be to create a package that includes the tables that define setup , such as the following :
# # To create a custom company configuration package
3 . Setup the new company in the way you need . Fill in all required setup tables .
4 . Open the new company .
6 . Add the tables that you want to transfer to another company to the worksheet . Assign the worksheet lines to the package .
7 . Create a questionnaire for the most frequently used setup tables .
8 . Create configuration templates to make it easier to create master data , such as customers or items .
9 . Export your package as a .rapidstart file .

# Design Details : Reservation , Order Tracking , and Action Messaging
The reservations system is comprehensive and includes the interrelated and parallel features of Order Tracking and Action Messaging .
The reservation system interacts with the planning system by creating action messages on planning lines during planning runs . An action message can be considered an appendage to an order tracking record . Action messages , whether created dynamically in order tracking or during the planning run , provide a convenient tool for efficient supply planning .
&gt; Reserved quantities are ignored by the planning system , that is , the hard link that is made between supply and demand cannot be changed through planning .
# # # Offsetting in Reservations
Reservations are made against available item quantities . Item availability is calculated in basic terms as follows :
available quantity = inventory + scheduled receipts - gross requirements
When a user intentionally creates a reservation , the user gains full ownership of and responsibility for these items . This means that the user must also manually change or cancel a reservation . Such manual changes may cause automatic modification of the involved reservations .
The following table shows when and which modifications may occur :
&#124; User Action &#124; System Reaction &#124;
&#124; Decreasing the reserved quantity &#124; The related quantity fields are updated . &#124;
&#124; Deleting the order &#124; The reservation is canceled . &#124;
Automatic reservations that are created during the planning run are handled in the following ways :
- They are included and potentially changed in subsequent planning runs , as opposed to manually reserved items .
Order Tracking helps the planner maintain a valid supply plan by providing an overview of the offsetting between demand and supply in the order network . The order tracking records serve as the foundation for creating dynamic action messages and planning line suggestions during planning runs .
&gt; The order tracking system offsets available stock as orders are entered into the order network . This implies that the system does not prioritize orders that may be more urgent in terms of their due date . It is therefore up to the logic of the planning system or the wisdom of the planner to rearrange these priorities in a meaningful way .
# # # The Order Network
The order tracking system is based on the principle that the order network must always be in a state of balance , in which every demand that enters the system is offset by a corresponding supply and vice versa . The system provides this by identifying logical links between all demand and supply entries in the order network .
# # # Offsetting in Order Tracking
In contrast to reservations , which can only be made against available item quantities , order tracking is possible against all order network entities that are part of the net requirements calculation of the planning system . The net requirements are calculated as follows :
net requirements = gross requirements + reorder point - scheduled receipts - planned receipts - projected available balance
&gt; Demand that is related to forecasts or planning parameters is not order tracked .
Assume the following data for two items that are set up for order tracking .
The following order tracking entries exist in the * * Reservation Entry * * table based on the data in the table .
# # # Entry Numbers 8 and 9
# # # Entry Numbers 10
&gt; Only the transfer order shipment is posted at this point , not the receipt .
Now the following order tracking entries exist in the * * Reservation Entry * * table .
Genuine surplus , as in this case , reflects excess supply or demand that remains untracked . It is an indication of imbalance in the order network , which will generate an action message by the planning system unless it is resolved dynamically .
# # # Entry Numbers 12 to 16
At this point in the scenario , the transfer order of the components from BLUE to RED location is posted as received .
# # # Entry Numbers 21 and 22
An action message addresses one BOM level at a time . If the user accepts the action message , this may give rise to additional action messages at the next BOM level .
The following table shows the action messages that exist .
1 . Check for any excess supply in the existing order tracking record for this demand .
2 . Check for planned and scheduled receipts in order of receipt date . The latest possible date is selected .
3 . Check for available stock .
An open demand passes through the list and offsets the available supply at each point . Any remaining demand is always covered by check 4 or check 5 .
If a decrease in demand quantity occurs , the order tracking system attempts to resolve the imbalance by performing the previous checks in reverse order . This means that existing action messages could be modified or even deleted , if necessary . The order tracking system always presents the net result of its calculations to the user .
# # Order Tracking and Planning
When the planning system runs , it deletes all existing order tracking records and action message entries and recreates them as planning line suggestions according to supply / demand pairs and priorities . When the planning run has finished , the order network is in balance .
# # # Planning System versus Order Tracking and Action Messaging
The following comparison shows the differences between the methods that are used by the planning system to create planning line suggestions and the methods that are used by the order tracking system to create order tracking records and action messages .
- The planning system deals with the entire supply and demand pattern of a particular item , whereas order tracking deals with the order that activated it .
- The planning system deals with all levels of the BOM hierarchy , whereas order tracking deals with one BOM level at a time .
- The planning system takes planning parameters into account , whereas order tracking does not .
- The planning system creates links in a user-activated batch mode when it balances demand and supply , whereas order tracking creates the links automatically and dynamically as the user enters orders .

# Design Details : Known Item Application Issue
The article starts by listing typical symptoms of the issue , followed by the basics of item application to support the described reasons for this issue . At the end of the article is a workaround to address such open item ledger entries .
# # Symptoms of the Issue
Typical symptoms of the issue with zero inventory although open item ledger entries exist are the following :
- The following message when you try to close an inventory period : “ The inventory cannot be closed because there is negative inventory for one or more items . ”
- An item ledger entry situation where both an outbound item ledger entry and its related inbound item ledger entry are open .
See the following example of an item ledger entry situation .
# # Basics of Item Application
- For an inbound item ledger entry , the item application entry is created when the item ledger entry is created .
There are two types of item application :
Quantity applications are made for all inventory transactions and are created automatically , or manually in special processes . When made manually , quantity applications are referred to as fixed application .
The following diagram shows how quantity applications are made .
&gt; If the outbound item ledger entry is valued by average cost , then the applied inbound item ledger entry is not the unique cost source . It merely plays a part in the calculation of the average cost of the period .
The following diagram shows how cost applications are made .
# # Illustration of a Basic Cost Flow
The following diagram illustrates the cost flow .
# # Reasons for the Issue
The issue with zero inventory although open item ledger entries exist can be caused by the following scenarios :
The following diagram illustrates how item applications are made in both scenarios .
To find out if the open item ledger entries are created , do as follows for the respective scenario :
For scenario 1 , identify the issue as follows :
For scenario 2 , identify the issue in either of the following ways :
For both scenarios , identify the involved cost application as follows :
3 . Analyze the item application entry , taking note of the following :
See the following example of an item application entry .
Notice above that inbound item ledger entry 334 is cost applied to outbound item ledger entry 333 .
# # Workaround for the Issue
- A positive adjustment to close the open outbound item ledger entry .
- A negative adjustment with the same quantity .
This adjustment balances the inventory increase caused by the positive adjustment and closes the open inbound item ledger entry .
The result is that inventory is zero and all item ledger entries are closed .

title : Using a Sales Credit Memo to Process Sales Returns or Cancellations &#124; Microsoft Docs
# Process Sales Returns or Cancellations
In addition to the original posted sales invoice , you can apply the sales credit memo or sales return order to other sales documents , for example another posted sales invoice because the customer is also returning items delivered with that invoice .
You can send the posted sales credit memo to the customer to confirm the return or cancellation and communicate that the related value will be reimbursed , for example when the items are returned .
To preserve correct inventory valuation , you typically want to put returned items back in inventory at the unit cost that they were sold at , not at their current unit cost . This is referred to as exact cost reversing .
# # To create a sales credit memo from a posted sales invoice
The sales credit memo header contains some information from the posted sales invoice . You can edit this , for example , with new information that reflects the return agreement .
The identifier of the sales credit memo displays in the * * Applies-to ID * * field .
After you create or edit sales credit memo lines , and the single or multiple applications are specified , you can post the sales credit memo .
The posted sales documents that you applied the credit memo to are now reversed , and a refund payment can be created for the customer . The sales credit memo is removed and replaced with a new document in the list of posted sales credit memos .
# # To create a sales credit memo by copying a posted sales invoice
9 . Complete the sales credit memo as explained in the &quot; To create a sales credit memo from a posted sales invoice &quot; section in this topic .
# # To create a sales return order based on one or more a posted sales documents
&gt; This field only works for posted shipments and posted invoice lines , not for posted return or posted credit memo lines .
# # To create a replacement sales order from a sales return order
# # To create return-related documents from a sales return order
# # To create a restock charge
You may decide to charge your customer a restock fee to cover the physical handling costs of returning an item . This could occur if the customer mistakenly ordered the wrong item or changed their mind after receiving the item you sold them , for example .
You can post this increased cost as an item charge in a credit memo or a return order and assign it to the posted shipment . The following describes it for a sales return order , but the same steps apply to a sales credit memo .
# # To create a sales allowance
You can send a customer a credit memo with a price reduction if the customer has received slightly damaged items or received the items late .
You can post this reduced price as an item charge in a credit memo or a return order and assign it to the posted shipment . The following describes it for a sales credit memo , but the same steps apply to a sales return order .
3 . Fill in the credit memo header with relevant information about the customer that you want to give the sales allowance to .
You may want to create a special item charge number to cover sales allowances .
When you post the sales return order , the sales allowance is added to the relevant sales entry amount . In this way , you can maintain accurate inventory valuation .
# # To combine return receipts
You can combine return receipts if your customer returns several items that are covered by different sales return orders .
When you receive the items into your warehouse , post the relevant sales return orders as received . This creates posted return receipts .
When you are ready to invoice this customer , instead of invoicing each sales return order separately , you can create a sales credit memo and automatically copy the posted return receipt lines to this document . Then you can post the sales credit memo and conveniently invoice all the open sales return orders at once .
# # # To manually combine return receipts
5 . Select the return receipt lines that you want to include in the credit memo :
# # # To automatically combine return receipts
You can automatically combine return receipts and have the option of automatically posting the credit memos using the * * Combine Return Receipts * * function .
# # # To remove a received and invoiced return order
When you invoice return receipts in this way , the return orders from which the return receipts were posted still exist , even if they have been fully received and invoiced .
Alternatively , delete individual sales return orders manually .

# Working with Calendar Dates and Times
# # Check your region and language settings
Note that the format in which dates are displayed on printed reports or emailed documents is not influenced by your personal choice of region setting .
To work more productively with dates and times , you can use any of the methods or formats that are described in the following sections .
# # # Picking dates from the calendar
# # # Day \ -week \ -year pattern
# # # Current work date
The work date feature allows you to record transactions using a date that is different from the current date .
If you have not defined a work date , the current date will be used as the work date . You may want to use a work date if you have many transactions with a date other than today &apos;s date .
&#124; `11` &#124; work date year.work date month.11. &#124;
&#124; `m` or `Monday` &#124; Monday of the work date week &#124;
&#124; `tu` or `Tuesday` &#124; Tuesday of the work date week &#124;
&#124; `sa` or `Saturday` &#124; Saturday of the work date week &#124;
&#124; `s` or `Sunday` &#124; Sunday of the work date week &#124;
&#124; `t23` &#124; Tuesday of week 23 of the work date year &#124;
&#124; `t-1` &#124; Tuesday of week 1 of the work date year &#124;
A date formula is a short , abbreviated combination of letters and numbers that specifies how to calculate dates . You can enter date formulas in various date calculation fields or filters .
The following example shows how to use `C` , for current , and a time unit .
The following example shows how to use a number and a time unit . A number cannot be larger than 9999 .
The following example shows how to use a time unit and a number .
&#124; `D10` &#124; The next 10th day of a month &#124;
When you enter times , you can insert any non-space separators that you want between the units , but if you use double digits for each unit up to milliseconds , then it is not required .
You only have to write the largest units that you require ; the rest will be set to zero . You can also leave out any AM / PM indicator .
# # Entering combined Dates and Times
It is also possible to enter only a date in a datetime field , but it is not possible to enter only a time .
&#124; `w` or `workdate` &#124; the working date 00 : 00 : 00 &#124;
Some fields in the application represent a duration , or amount of elapsed time , instead of a specific date or time . You enter a duration as a number followed by its unit of measure .
You can also enter a number , which will be automatically converted to a duration . The number you enter is converted according to the default unit of measure that has been specified for the duration field .
For example , if the unit of measure is hours , the number `5` is converted to 5 hrs .

You can fill customer fields on the sales invoice in two ways depending on whether the customer is already registered . See steps 2 and 3 in the following procedure .
# # To create a sales invoice
Several fields on the sales invoice are now filled with information that you specified on the new customer card .
You are now ready to fill in the sales invoice lines for products that you are selling to the customer or for any transaction with the customer that you want to record in a G / L account .
The related item and customer ledger entries are now created in your system , and the sales invoice is output as a PDF document . The sales invoice is removed from the list of sales invoices and replaced with a new document in the list of posted sales invoices .
Depending on your business needs , you can get paid and register that payment in different ways : manually , automatically , and through payment services .

# Export to an Excel static worksheet
# # Export data to an Excel static worksheet
You may have the option to export data to an Excel static worksheet in all record types . However , in some cases the format might be legacy , or the data might not be filtered by what you see in the app .
&gt; To fix the issue do this :
&gt; We still strongly recommend that you save and then open the data file rather than disabling protected view , which might put your computer at risk .
4 . Open Excel and then open the .xlsx file you saved in the previous step .
By default , an exported worksheet includes the fields that are displayed in the list , using the same field order , sorting , and field widths .
- You can email a static exported worksheet to anyone or store it in a shared file . Anyone who opens the file will see all the data in the file .
- The date and time values that you see in the app show up only as Date when you export the file to Excel , but the cell actually shows both the date and time .

A * language tag * can be in one of three formats :

It is assumed that the host operating system and / or browser are using the default locale for the location .
For our purposes , we only need to look at the language of the locale and not the region . If regional considerations were important , we could have included the full language tag value in the table above .
3 . Save the Excel file to your local file system .
Be aware that translated strings in other languages could be significantly longer than they are in your language . In many cases , the labels and other elements that display the strings in your user interface will need to be wider to accommodate .
You can translate text on demand using a translation service , such as the Microsoft Translator service :
This approach comes with some drawbacks when compared to the previous example which utilized a pre-translated table of text strings :
* The translation will take time to complete , requiring a call to a service across the network . This will result in a lag to see the translated text in your app .
* The translation will be mechanical and may not be what you anticipate or be the best choice for the situation within your app .

# Design model-driven apps by using the app designer
The app designer helps you bring together all these components quickly . Its tile-based information structure and simplified interface make the process of building an app much easier , and you can create apps that are specific to your business roles and functions without having to write any code .
You can add or remove entities as necessary , and also add other components .
The following table shows the steps you &apos;ll take to create an app .

A browser tab opens with the default form in Power Apps Studio .
The form appears with just the fields that you added .
The input mechanism changes to a * * Drop down * * control .
# # Add the Locations list
While holding down the Alt key , open the list of locations , select one , open the list of departments , and then select one .
# # Save and open the form ( optional )
Confirm whether you &apos;re displaying the correct field for your control in either of these ways :

# # # Connect to SharePoint lists
The lists are now displayed as tables in Query Editor .
# # # Remove unnecessary columns from the tables
# # # Change the data type on Project Details columns
# # # Change the data type on Project Requests columns
# # # Apply and save changes
# # Step 2 : Improve the data model
* Add a date table so we can make calculations based on weekdays
* Add calculated columns to calculate timespans between project milestones
* Add measures to calculate variance in projected versus actual days for a project
# # # Change table relationships
# # # Add a date table to make date-based calculations easier
# # # Add a calculated column to the Dates table
# # # Add a calculated column to the Project Details table
2 . Enter this formula into the formula bar :
# # # Add a calculated column to the Project Requests table
# # # Add a measure to the Project Details table
This formula calculates the variance between actual and projected days for a project . We add this as a measure , rather than a calculated column , so it returns the correct results regardless of how the data is filtered or aggregated in a report .
# # # Add a measure to the Project Requests table
This formula finds the project that has been pending the longest , based on the calculated column we defined earlier .
# # Step 3 : Create report visualizations
Now we &apos;re at the step that many people think of when they think of data analysis : creating visualizations so we can find patterns in our data . In this step , we &apos;ll create four visualizations :
* A column chart that shows projected days versus actual days on projects
* A column chart that shows the variance for each project
* A card that shows the project that has been pending the longest
* A table that shows the time between project approval and projected start date
5 . The visualization should now look like the following image .
The chart is now filtered to show only completed projects , which makes sense because we are comparing projected days to actual days .
7 . Click the arrows in the upper left corner of the chart to move up and down the hierarchy of project managers and projects . In the following image , you see what the drill down into projects looks like .
# # # Create a bar chart to show variance from projected
1 . Click or tap on the canvas outside the visualization you just created .
The visualization should now look like the following image .
6 . Before we create more visualizations , move and resize the ones you already created , so they fit side-by-side .
# # # Create a card that shows the longest pending project
After we publish this report , we &apos;ll use this tile to trigger an alert if the maximum value for a pending project reaches a certain threshold .
# # # Create a table that shows the time between project approval and projected start date
As you can see , projects that Irvin Sayers runs tend to start a lot later after approval . There could be factors other than the assigned manager , but this would be worth looking into .

# ForAll function in Power Apps
The result of each formula evaluation is returned in a table , in the same order as the input table .
If the result of the formula is a single value , the resulting table will be a single-column table . If the result of the formula is a record , the resulting table contains records with the same columns as the result record .
When writing your formula , keep in mind that records can be processed in any order and , when possible , in parallel . The first record of the table may be processed after the last record .
# # # Using a connection
# # # Copying a table
But before you make that copy , think carefully if it is needed . Many situations can be addressed by filtering and shaping the underlying data source on-demand with a formula . Some of the downsides to making a copy include :
* Two copies of the same information mean that one of them can fall out of sync .
* Making a copy can consume much of the computer memory , network bandwidth , and / or time .
Our goal is to work with a derivative table that includes only the items where more has been requested than is available , and for which we need to place an order :
We can perform this task in a couple of different ways , all of which produce the same result , with various pros and cons .
# # # # Table shaping on demand
Don &apos;t make that copy ! We can use the following formula anywhere we need :
And because we didn &apos;t make a copy , there is no additional copy of the information to manage or fall out of date .
# # # # ForAll on demand
This formula may be simpler for some people to read and write .

Screen readers navigate grids more reliably and consistently , and announce row and column headings , as well as the position within the grid . When you first open a grid , the default tab stop is the view selector .
Whenever you enter a cell within the grid from outside of the grid , Narrator announces the name of the table , the row and column counts , and the position of your cursor within the table .
To navigate through each element of a dashboard stream , use the Up / Down arrow keys . Narrator will read the type of control and the title of the control .

In this example , you &apos;ll create a menu component that resembles the following graphic . And you can change the text later to use it in multiple screens , apps , or both :
# # # Create a new component
You can set the property &apos;s value in the formula bar if you select the name of the property on the * * Properties * * tab of the right-hand pane .
# # # Add component to a screen
Next , you &apos;ll add the component to a screen and specify a table of strings for the component to show .
1 . In the left navigation bar , select the list of screens , and then select the default screen .
This instance resembles this graphic , but you can customize the text and other properties of each instance .
# # # Create and use output property
So far , you &apos;ve created a component and added it to an app . Next , you &apos;ll create an output property that reflects the item that the user selects in the menu .
1 . While holding down the Alt key , select each item in the menu .
The * * Label * * control reflects the menu item that you selected most recently .
# # Import and export components
# # # Import components from another app
You can save an app with existing components to a file locally and then reuse the file by importing it . You can use the file to import components to another app .
If the app contains a modified version of the same component , you &apos;re prompted to decide whether to replace the modified version or cancel the import .
After you create components in an app , other apps can consume the components from this app by importing them .
# # # Export components from your app
Selecting * * Export components * * downloads the components to a file :
The downloaded component file uses the * .msapp * file name extension .
# # # Import components from exported components file
# # # Import components from exported app
Once you save the app , you can reuse the components of this app using the same method of importing components from a file . Follow the steps in the previous section on import components from exported components file .
- You can &apos;t save data sources , forms , and data tables with components .
- Collections in components are not supported .
- You can &apos;t insert a component into a gallery or a form .
- You can &apos;t package media files when you import a component .

# Create guided help ( Learning Path ) for your app
Use Learning Path to give your users a custom , in-app Help experience that is tailored to your environment and the specific usage and workflow of your organization .
# # How is Learning Path different from customizable Help ?
To create Learning Path content , you must :
- Have opted in for Learning Path . This setting is on by default , but it might have been turned off .
- Have the System Customizer or System Administrator Role , or another role that has the Learning Path Authoring privilege .
# # Add a user to the Office 365 Learning Path Authors security group
You might be asked to reenter your password .
# # How does Learning Path work with multiple organizations ?
When you publish Learning Path content , you can use Publishing Environments to control which organizations associated with the tenant your content is published to . To publish different content to different organizations , create multiple publishing environments and add each organization to one or more of them .
# # Learning Path and Common Data Service security roles
If your organization has multiple business units , security roles can have parent / child relationships . Only the security roles in the root business unit are synchronized .
# # # Learning Path role precedence
If you create different content for different roles on the same model-driven app page or screen , users will see the content associated with the role with higher precedence .
# # # Manage security roles and precedence
# # # # Configure security roles
1 . Sign in to Power Apps with an account that has Learning Path authoring permissions .
Precedence is determined by the order of the roles listed on this page .
Make sure to include the slash ( / ) after .com .
The first time you connect to the mobile app interface , a welcome screen is displayed while the system processes metadata and downloads customizations . After this is completed , your workspace is displayed .

# # Learning Path content types : Guided Tasks and Sidebars
You can create two types of content in Learning Path : Guided Tasks and Sidebars .
There are two steps for creating a Guided Task :
1 . Define how the task is triggered , and assign the roles to which the content applies .
2 . Use the Flow Editor to add the steps that users will see as they step through the Guided Task .
# # # Define the triggers and roles
1 . Go to the page for which you want to create a Guided Task .
# # # Add steps with the Flow Editor
4 . Select the type of step you want to add , and then drag the tile to the UI to pin it to a control . It may take a few tries to get used to placing the step where you want it .
6 . Add content to the step by using the controls displayed next to it . The following settings are available :
&gt; You can always edit the step later , so don &apos;t worry if you accidentally close it before you have it just how you want it .
9 . Add any additional steps you want to include in your Guided Task , making sure to save each step when you &apos;re finished adding content .
12 . If you &apos;re happy with your changes , check them in and publish the Guided Task , or publish it later from the Content Library .
There are two steps for creating a Sidebar :
1 . Set the Sidebar properties and assign the roles to which it applies .
# # # Set the Sidebar properties and roles
1 . Go to the page for which you want to create a Sidebar .
# # # Add content to your Sidebar

# # Localize Learning Path controls
# Entities and metadata in Common Data Service
# # Create new metadata or use existing metadata ?
Each of these entities also contain a number of fields that represent common data that the system may need to store for the respective entity .
For most organizations it is to your advantage to use the standard entities and attributes for the purposes they were provided .
If you install a solution you can expect that the solution developer has leveraged the standard entities and attributes . Creating a new custom entity that replaces a system entity or attribute will mean that any solutions available may not work for your organization .

# Customize content by using content snippets
Snippets can be edited either through the Portal Management app . The main power of the snippet is the fact that you can abstract a bit of content ( other than the main copy of the page ) and edit it separately , allowing essentially any static content on your site to be fully content-managed and editable .
Enter values for the following fields :
&#124; Name &#124; The name can be used by a developer to place the snippet value into a page template within the portal &apos;s code . &#124;
&#124; Website &#124; The website that is associated with the snippet . &#124;
&#124; Display Name &#124; Display name for the content snippet . &#124;
After you create a snippet with text , HTML , or liquid objects shown in the example above , you can use it in a portal page .
To do add snippet on a portal page :

# Understand canvas-app tables and records in Power Apps
# # Elements of a table
A field is an individual piece of information in a record . You can visualize this sort of field as a value in a column for a particular record .
The column &apos;s name reflects the fields in that column .
You may have referred to columns as &quot; fields &quot; in other tools .
A table comprises one or more records , each with multiple fields that have consistent names across the records .
Any table that &apos;s stored in a data source or a collection has a name , which you use to refer to the table and pass it to functions that take tables as arguments . Tables can also be the result of a function or a formula .
You can also define a single-column table with square brackets . An equivalent way to write the above :
In Excel and Power Apps , you use formulas to manipulate numbers and strings of text in similar ways :
Let &apos;s walk through some simple examples .
&gt; Some controls have been rearranged and enlarged for illustration purposes .
# # Table functions and control properties
Properties of controls can also be tables :
2 . While holding down the Alt key , select the button .
You can also use a record as a general-purpose container for related named values .
# # Record functions and control properties
Functions that return records :
Properties that return records :
Some functions operate by evaluating a formula across all the records of a table individually . The formula &apos;s result is used in various ways :
Inside these formulas , you can reference the fields of the record being processed . Each of these functions creates a &quot; record scope &quot; in which the formula is evaluated , where the fields of the record are available as top-level identifiers . You can also reference control properties and other values from throughout your app .
For example , take a table of * * Products * * :
To determine whether any of any of these products had more requested than is available :
Adding to this example , we can calculate how much of each product to order :
Finally , we can reduce the result table to just the columns that we want :
Let &apos;s put it all together . In this context , the following formula :
produces this table :
This formula produces this single-column table :
You express records by using curly braces that contain named field values . For example , you can express the first record in the table at the start of this topic by using this formula :
You can also embed formulas within other formulas , as this example shows :
You can nest records by nesting curly braces , as this example shows :
Enclose each column name that contains a special character , such as a space or a colon , in single quotes . To use a single quote within a column name , double it .
You can also nest tables :
# Tab properties for model-driven app forms overview
In the body of a form , tabs provide horizontal separation . Tabs have a label that can be displayed . If the label is displayed , tabs can be expanded or collapsed to show or hide their content by choosing the label .
These are the properties available to configure when using a tab on a form using the classic form designer . The following table shows properties that you can set for tabs on the form :

title : &quot; Manage websites in portals &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
With a website providing an application scope , multiple distinct portal applications can be connected to a single organization .
&gt; Determination of which website record a given portal application is bound to is usually by the website &apos;s name , specified in the configuration of the portal deployment .
However , it is also possible to control this by domain name or website bindings .
Websites are created when you create a new portal . However , advanced website management can be performed from the Portal Management app .
3 . To edit an existing website , select the website name .
4 . Enter or edit appropriate values in the fields .
&#124; Name &#124; The descriptive name of the website . This field is required . &#124;

# Image control in Power Apps
A control that shows an image from , for example , a local file or a data source .
# # # Show an image from a local file
The * * Image * * control shows the image that you specified .
# # # Show a set of images from a data source
* Consider checking for contrast issues within the image , if it is not purely decorative .
All three functions ignore characters that aren &apos;t letters .
Each formula returns a single-column table that contains the converted strings .
# Validate function in Power Apps
Before a user submits a data change , you can provide immediate feedback on the validity of that submission , resulting in a better user experience .
Data sources can provide information on what constitutes valid values within a record . This information can include many constraints , such as these examples :
* whether a column requires a value
* how long a string of text can be
* how high and low a number can be
* how early and late a date can be
# # # Validate with a single column
# # # Validate with a complete record

# Query and visualize hierarchically related data
You can get valuable business insights by visualizing hierarchically related data . The hierarchical modelling and visualization capabilities give you a number of benefits :
- View and explore complex hierarchical information .
- View key performance indicators ( KPIs ) in the contextual view of a hierarchy .
- Visually analyze key information across the web and the tablets .
The following examples illustrate various scenarios for querying hierarchies :
Query account hierarchy , including related opportunities
To query the data as a hierarchy , you must set one of the entity ’ s one-to-many or many-to-one self-referential relationships as hierarchical . To turn the hierarchy on :
4 . Select a self-referential relationship .
&gt; - Some of the out-of the-box relationships can ’ t be customized . This will prevent you from setting those relationships as hierarchical .
If you select the hierarchy icon , you can view the hierarchy , with the tree view on the left and the tile view on the right , as shown below :
&gt; If an entity can be enabled for a hierarchy :
Important things to remember when you create visualizations :
- Presently , a hierarchy or visualization is based on one entity only . You can depict the account hierarchy showing accounts at multiple levels , but you can ’ t show accounts and contacts in the same hierarchy visualization .
&gt; The hierarchy icons don ’ t appear in the record grid view until the records are paired in the parent – child relationship .

You can enable additional entities for search functionality . Configuring search for additional entities requires additional actions , which are described in this article .
Following considerations apply when configuring additional entities for global search :
The explicit configuration explained above ensures that no records will accidentally be made available via global search .
# # # Site setting for additional entities
Ensure that your search results page has an entity form , or has logic written to show the search result details .
# # Walkthrough - configure search for additional entities with sample database

# # Step 2 : Create or verify the Portal Search view
1 . Ensure appropriate columns are added to the view for search .
# # Step 3 : Create entity permissions
# # Step 6 : Rebuild the search index

# # Field Types used by the system
There are some fields used by the system that you cannot add using the designer .
Multi-select option set is only available in read-only grids , editable grids , and forms . Multi-select option set is not supported in :
Multi-select fields are supported in the following types of forms :
You can use global option sets that are defined in your organization to configure values for the multi-select option sets .
# # Using the right type of number
Decimal numbers are stored in the database exactly as specified . Floating point numbers store an extremely close approximation of the value . Why choose extremely close approximation when you can have the exact value ? The answer is that you get different system performance .
Individuals can also change their personal options to select a default currency for the records they create .
When you configure a currency field you can choose the precision value . There are three options as shown in the following table .
&#124; Currency Precision &#124; This option applies the precision defined for the currency in the record . &#124;
# # Different types of lookups
However , you should be aware that not every lookup behaves this way . There are several different types of system lookups as shown here .
Use image fields to display a single image per record in the application . Each entity can have one image field . You can add an image field to custom entities but not to standard entities . Some standard entities have image fields defined .
Even though an entity has an image field , displaying that image in a model-driven app requires that you enable two settings .
When image display is enabled for an entity , any records that don ’ t have an image will display a placeholder image . For example :
People can choose the default image to upload a picture from their computer . Images must be less than 10 MB and must be in one of the following formats :
When the image is uploaded , it will be converted to a .jpg format and all downloaded images will also use this format . If an animated .gif is uploaded , only the first frame is saved .
8 . Open the form where you want image support , such as the entity main form .
&gt; Once the maximum file size has been saved , it can &apos;t be changed .
App users can now select the image to display on the form . When an app user opens the form for a record , they can choose the image that they want displayed on the form .
&gt; If the record is a new record that hasn ’ t been saved the error Invalid Argument is returned when you try to change the image .
Once an entity form has an image field , app users can change the image for a given record .
1 . Open the app that includes the entity form , and then select the image on the form .

# # Enable connection roles for an entity
There are a number of standard connection roles already configured in Common Data Service .
The list of available connection roles are displayed .
# # # View and edit connection roles using the classic experience
In this view you can see all the connection roles that are available for this environment and you can edit them here .
# # Add connection roles to a solution
Because connection roles are * solution aware * , which means that they can be included in a solution , you can also add connection roles to a solution you distribute .
Once you add the connection role to your solution , you can edit it wherever it is visible .
&gt; The connection role status is not included with the connection role when it is exported from a solution . Therefore , when the solution is imported into a target environment , the status will be set to active by default .
# # Create a connection role
# # # Describe the connection role
Set the following fields :
# # # # Connection Role Category values
The default * * Connection Role Category * * values are :
# # # # Select record types
Select which record types should be available to connect .
# # # # Matching connection roles
In this optional step , you can define any roles that be applied in a reciprocal manner . It is not required , but connections are more meaningful if these are defined .
When people set a connection role that doesn &apos;t have a matching connection role , the role will only be displayed when viewing the connection from the record that the connection was applied to . When viewed from the connected record , the role will be empty unless a matching role is set .
&gt; You will need to save a new connection role without this matching connection role before you can set the matching connection role to itself .
If more than one matching connection role is configured , those connection roles represent the only valid reciprocal roles . The first one will be applied automatically as the default value . If the default value is not correct , people need to manually edit the connection and choose between valid options defined in the configuration .

This error is caused because the number of activity entities for the data retrieval has exceeded the maximum limit of 10 .
To work around the issue , you must reduce the number of entities to 10 or fewer . To do this , follow the steps below .

title : &quot; Configure header properties in the form designer &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# Configure header properties in the form designer
Makers can control the density of model-driven app form headers to match the needs of anyone using the form .
High-density form header ensures that key information is always visible to users . Using high-density header , the record title never truncates . Even long record titles are displayed using multiple lines . Similarly , high-density header also ensures that up to four field values are directly visible in the header and never truncated or hidden .
To ensure that key information is always visible , the framework displays read-only field values and users can &apos;t directly edit the field values in the header . Visualizations such as custom components or web resources also aren &apos;t allowed .
When a form does not specify header density or when a new form is created , the framework defaults to high-density header .
Low density form header allows users to directly edit the field values in the header . It also allows visualizations such as custom components and web resources .
However , often this comes at the cost of key information being truncated or not readily visible . Low-density header truncates the record title as well as field values displayed in the header . Often only one or two fields are directly visible in the header and the rest overflow and are displayed in a flyout requiring an extra click .
# # # Configuring header density
To configure the header density of a model-driven form , follow these steps :
&gt; Use the new form designer . The classic form designer does not provide the ability to configure the header density .
The header flyout is displayed when users select the chevron in the form header . It enables users to edit field values and also displays visualizations such as custom components or web resources that are a part of the form header .
With a high-density form header , the header flyout displays all header fields including the four fields that are directly displayed in the header . The framework defaults to show the header flyout when high-density header is being used . Makers can control the visibility of the header flyout with a high-density header .
With a low-density form header , the header flyout displays only overflow fields , such as fields that the form is unable to display directly in the header based on the width of the form . The header flyout is also automatically displayed or hidden based on the number of fields in the header and the width of the form . Makers can &apos;t control the visibility of the header flyout when using a low-density header .
# # # Show or hide the header flyout
To show or hide the header flyout for a model-driven form , follow these steps :
&gt; - Use the new form designer . The classic form designer does not provide the ability to show or hide the header flyout .
&gt; - The visibility of header flyout can only be controlled when using high-density form header . When using low-density header , the header flyout is automatically displayed or hidden based on the number of fields in the header and the width of the form .
# # Form designer messages related to form headers
When you edit forms using the new or classic form designer , you might see messages related to form headers . Below , you can find details on each message and why you are seeing it .
This message is displayed in the form designer when a maker creates a new main form ( including via the Save-as action ) or edits a main form that has not previously been configured for header density .
The framework defaults to high-density header and this message helps makers become aware of that behavior . Makers can override the framework default at any time by manually configuring the form header density as outlined earlier .
This message is displayed in the form designer when a maker opens a main form for editing that is configured to use low-density header .
The message helps increase awareness about the high-density header and its benefits .
This message is displayed in the form designer when a form is using high-density header with the header flyout visible .
High-density header displays read-only values of the first four fields in the header . When makers add a field in the header in the top four positions , it causes an existing field that was directly displayed in the header to become extended and visible only in the header flyout .
The message informs the maker of the change and confirms whether to proceed with the action .
This message is displayed in the form designer when a form is using high-density header with the header flyout hidden .
High-density header displays read-only values of up to four fields in the header . Because the header flyout is hidden , users will be unable to see the additional fields .
The message informs the maker that there are already four fields in the header and prevents adding additional fields in the header that users will not be able to see .
High-density header displays read-only values of fields in the header . Because the header flyout is hidden , users will be unable to see any custom components associated with the fields in the header .
High-density header displays read-only values of fields in the header . Because the header flyout is hidden , users will be unable to edit field values .
The message informs the maker that any fields added to the header will be read-only and that any fields they want users to edit should also be added to a section in the form .
This message is displayed in the form designer only for forms using high-density header with the header flyout hidden .
This message is displayed in the classic form designer when a maker opens a main form for editing and it is configured to use low density header .
This message helps increase awareness about the high density header and its benefits and that makers should use the new form designer to configure header density .
The message helps increase awareness about the high-density header and its benefits and that makers should use the new form designer to configure header density .
# # # This form is using high density header . For the best authoring experience with this form , use the new form designer .
This message is displayed in the classic form designer when a maker opens a main form for editing and it is configured to use high-density header .
The message informs the maker that when editing a form that is using high-density header , they should use the new form designer . This helps ensure the maker is aware of the impact of their changes to the form header .

# How to customize an app screen based on column status inside SharePoint list ?
Limiting access to SharePoint objects can be achieved using fine-grained permissions inside SharePoint . However , it becomes difficult to scan through all items in your app screen especially when using different devices .
One of the most common problems is how to limit the items in a canvas app screen based on status of columns , instead of controlling access using the permissions .
This method allows you to create multiple screens to show different SharePoint objects based on column status , while at the same time without customizing permissions or overwhelming the app user with the entire list .
- You need two user accounts with access to the app and SharePoint site hosting the lists .
- You need to be knowledgeable about how to configure SharePoint lists and list / item permissions .

From the * * Solutions * * area , select a solution to view all of its components .
# # Search and filter in a solution
You can also search for a specific component by its name .
Or filter all items in the list by the component type .
As you select each component , the actions available in the command bar will change depending on the type of the component you have selected and if the solution is the default or a managed one .
When you don &apos;t select any component , the command bar will show actions applied to the solution itself .
The following limitations apply to the use of canvas apps , flows , and custom connectors in solutions .
- Canvas app button triggered flows must be created from an app already in a solution . Adding this type of flow from outside solutions is blocked .
- The app and flow will not currently be connected in the target environment post deployment . First associate valid connections with the flow and activate the flow . Then edit the app and re-associate the flow to the button .
- Canvas apps won &apos;t display in the classic solution explorer . Use the modern experience . There are no plans for them to be added to classic solution explorer .
- Deleting a managed solution does not rollback to a different canvas app version . Instead , all versions of the app are deleted .
- Importing a solution containing a flow will not automatically create or associate required connections . The flow must be edited to fix the connections .
- If using managed solutions , this creates an active customization in the unmanaged layer . Therefore subsequent solution updates to the flow will not be reflected .
- Flows created from solutions will not be displayed in the &quot; Team Flows &quot; list . They must be accessed through a solution .
- Button triggered flows are not available in solutions .
- Flows triggered from Microsoft 365 applications such as Excel are not available in solutions .
- Flows that connect to SharePoint are not available in solutions .
- Flows in solutions don &apos;t support delegated authentication . For example , access to a flow is not automatically granted based on having access to the SharePoint list the flow was created from .
- Custom connectors created outside solutions cannot be added to solutions at this time .

You can manually import solutions using the steps in this article . You must import only those solutions that you &apos;ve obtained from a trusted source . Customizations might include code that can send data to external sources .
When you import an * * unmanaged * * solution :
- You add all the components of that solution into your environment and can &apos;t delete the components by deleting the solution . Deleting the unmanaged solution deletes only the solution container .
- That contains components you have already customized , your customizations will be overwritten by the customizations in the imported unmanaged solution . You can ’ t undo this .
To import a solution :
If you have imported any changes that require publishing , you must publish customizations before they are available .
When you download the log file , you will find an XML file that you can open using Office Excel to view the contents .
# Overview of the meeting-screen template for canvas apps

# Test Studio ( experimental )
Build end-to-end UI tests for your canvas app using Test Studio . Maintain your app quality by continually validating that your app works as expected when new changes or updates are deployed .
The following section explains key Test Studio terminology .
Test suites are used to organize or group test cases together . As the number of test cases in the app grows , you might consider organizing the test cases in specific features or functionality . For example , you might have one test suite with test cases to validate expense report submissions and another test suite that focuses just on expense approvals .
In the expense app example above , you can write an assertion to validate whether an expense report is created with an expense line item having zero cost associated .
When testing canvas apps using Test Studio , consider the following best practices to gain maximum benefits to improve your app quality :
It &apos;s difficult to automate all tests and we do not recommend that you completely rely on test automation . Manual testing should be performed in addition to test automation . Tests best suited to automation are :
- Repetitive tests .
- High business impact functionality tests .
- Features that are stable and not undergoing significant change .
- Features that require multiple data sets .
A test action can contain multiple expressions . Large multi-action test expressions for a single step might impact your ability to debug and isolate any test failures . Consider dividing a test step with multiple actions into more test steps of single actions to identify issues faster .
Each test case should have one or more expected results . Test assertions should be used to validate the expected outcomes of your test against the actual outcomes . Multiple assertions can be written for a single test case .
For maintenance , group or categorize similar test cases together and describe the purpose and expected results of your test .
- Nested galleries .
- Formula-level error management experimental feature needs to be turned on for the app .
- Person-type columns .

# Create responsive layouts in canvas apps
If you create a responsive layout , controls can respond to different devices or window sizes , making various experiences feel more natural . To achieve responsive layout , you adjust some settings and write expressions throughout your app .
# # Disable Scale to fit
You can configure each screen so that its layout adapts to the actual space in which the app is running .
To make your app responsive , you must take additional steps , but this change is the first step toward making responsiveness possible .
# # Understand app and screen dimensions
# # Use formulas for dynamic layout
To create a responsive design , you locate and size each control by using formulas instead of absolute ( constant ) coordinate values . These formulas express each control &apos;s position and size in terms of the overall screen size or relative to other controls on the screen .
In the simplest case , one control fills an entire screen . To create this effect , set the control &apos;s properties to these values :
Set the properties for these controls to these values :
# # Adapting layout for device size and orientation
# # # Screen sizes and breakpoints
The authoring canvas doesn &apos;t respond to the sizing formulas created . To test responsive behavior , save and publish your app , and then open it on devices or in browser windows of various sizes and orientations .
# GUID function in Power Apps
The string passed can contain uppercase or lowercase letters , but it must be 32 hexadecimal digits in either of these formats :
If you don &apos;t specify an argument , this function creates a new GUID .
To convert a GUID value to a string , simply use it in a string context . The GUID value will be converted to a hexadecimal representation string with hyphens and lowercase letters .
When used in a data-flow formula , a volatile function will return a different value only if the formula in which it appears is reevaluated . If nothing else changes in the formula , it will have the same value throughout the execution of your app .
# # # # Basic usage
To return a GUID value based on the hexadecimal string representation :
You can also provide the GUID string without hyphens . This formula returns the same GUID value :
This formula creates a single-column table that &apos;s used to iterate five times , resulting in five GUIDs .
1 . While holding down the Alt key , select the button by clicking or tapping it .
The data table shows a list of GUIDs :
1 . Select the button again to show a different list of GUIDs :
To generate a single GUID instead of a table , use this formula :
# Troubleshoot problems with data not displaying in a report

Business is not confined to a single region or a language . A single portal can display content in multiple languages to reach customers around the world . The content of your portal can be translated into multiple languages while maintaining a single content hierarchy .
To enable multiple languages for a portal , follow these steps :
# # Create content in multiple languages
1 . Sign in to Dynamics 365 Portals .
&gt; The configuration fields on the home page of a content page is not inherited to the existing content pages . They are used only in creation of new content pages . You must update the content page configurations individually .

On the right side are tabs that you &apos;ll use to select components and set component properties .
Here are the steps for adding a dashboard to the app . Use the same steps to add a business process flow or entity .
On the app designer canvas , the rightmost pane shows you dashboards that are available in the default solution .
&gt; Alternatively , you can also do one of the following :
The dashboard list will be filtered to show results that match your keywords .
Additionally , if you &apos;re using the Unified Interface client , you can also add entity dashboard assets to the app .
This section describes the steps for adding a form to the app . Use the same steps to add a view or chart to the app .
On the app designer canvas , the entire row for the entity is selected . On the right side , you &apos;ll see all existing forms for the selected entity .
If no dashboards or business process flows are selected , all the dashboards and business process flows will be available for users while they use the app .
In the drop-down list , select the type of form you want to create .
&gt; The drop-down list is available only when you &apos;re adding forms . It isn &apos;t available for views and charts .
5 . Repeat these steps to add entity views and charts to the app .
# # Edit or remove artifacts
The designer for the selected artifact opens .
Another way to remove a dashboard or business process flow is by clearing the corresponding check box on the * * Components * * tab .
&gt; When you make any changes to an entity &amp; mdash ; like changing an entity display name or description &amp; mdash ; the changes don &apos;t appear in the app designer unless the changes are published in the solution explorer .

# Combo box control in Power Apps
A control that allows users to make selections from provided choices . Supports search and multiple selections .
Single or multi-select mode is configured via the SelectMultiple property .
When viewing on small screens , the items list flyout will become a full screen control for better usablility .
The control shows the data from the column that you specified in the data source that you specified .
&gt; On touch screens , screen reader users can navigate the contents of the combo box sequentially . The combo box acts as a button that shows or hides its contents when selected .
&gt; The tab key navigates to or away from the combo box . Arrow keys navigate the contents of the combo box . The escape key closes the drop down when opened .

title : &quot; Add and configure a quick view component on a form &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# Add and configure a quick view component on a form
# # Add a quick view component
# # Configure a quick view component
These are the properties available to configure when using a quick view component on a form using the form designer .
- List of organizations in the Tenant
- Usage data of end users – such as time spent on Learning Paths or clicks recorded
- Aggregated end-user data – Location , security role , user language
- Verbatim feedback from end users
- Controls that are created by using Learning Path .
- Configuration-related Learning Path Authoring .
# Custom connectors for canvas apps
# Add record-based security by using entity permissions for portals
To secure these features , entity permissions allow for granular rights to be granted for arbitrary entities and for record-level security to be enabled via relationship definitions .
# # Add entity permissions to a web role
&gt; Selecting entities like webpage , web files and other configuration entities is invalid and might have other unintended consequences . The portal will assert the security of configuration entities based on content access controls , not entity permissions .
With Contact scope , a signed-in user in the role for which the permission record is defined will have the rights granted by that permission only for records that are related to that user &apos;s contact record via a defined relationship .
In this most complex case , permissions are granted for an entity that is a relationship away from an entity for which an Entity Permission record has already been defined . This permission is actually a child record of the parent entity permission .
The table below explains the entity permission attributes .
&#124; Name &#124; The descriptive name of the record . This field is required . &#124;
&#124; Entity Name &#124; The logical name of the entity that is to be secured or that will define the contact relationship or parent relationship to secure a related entity on a child permission . This field is required . &#124;
&#124; Parent Relationship &#124; Required only if a parent entity permission is assigned . The schema name of the relationship between the entity specified by the Entity Name field and the entity specified by the Entity Name field on its Parent Entity Permission record . &#124;
&#124; Parent Entity Permission &#124; Required only if Scope = Parent . &#124;
&#124; Read &#124; Privilege that controls whether the user can read a record . &#124;
&#124; Write &#124; Privilege that controls whether the user can update a record . &#124;
&#124; Delete &#124; Privilege that controls whether the user can delete a record . &#124;
# # Global permissions for tasks related to leads
This role has a related Entity Permission for the Lead entity , with a Global scope .
Users in this role can access all leads via entity lists or forms on the portal .
# # Contact-scoped permissions for tasks
After these permissions are in place , users in the Lead Manager role can access leads that are related to them directly as specified by the contact-scope permission , and access tasks related to those same leads as specified by the child permission record .
To resolve this issue , the Azure Active Directory administrator must follow either of the procedures that are presented later in this article .
# # Allow users to consent to apps that access company data
This approach is perhaps easier than the next , but it allows for broader permissions .
# # Allow Power Query to access company data
As an alternative , the tenant administrator can give consent to Power Query without modifying tenant-wide permissions .
2 . Run the following PowerShell commands :
In Power Apps , you access the Query Editor by doing the following :
After you confirm that you want to delete your queries , they are deleted .
To export personal data , users can do the following :
1 . Open the Query Editor .
System-generated logs about user actions on the user interface ( UI ) can be accessed in the Azure portal .
# Slider control in Power Apps
A control with which the user can specify a value by dragging a handle .
The user can indicate a value , between a minimum and a maximum value that you specify , by dragging the handle of a slider left-right or up-down , depending on the direction that you choose .
8 . To return to the default workspace , press Esc .
* Slider value must be shown when interacting with the keyboard . This can be achieved by any one of these methods :
# Add , configure , move , or delete components on a form
# # Add components to a form
# # # Add components to a form using drag and drop
4 . Drag and drop the component onto the form preview . As you drag the component on the form preview , you will see drop targets where you can add the component .
Note the following :
- Components can be dropped before or after any existing component or field .
- Components can also be dropped in the empty area within a section . In this case the component will be added in an available space so as to evenly distribute fields and components across the section columns .
- Hovering over a tab header when dragging a component changes the currently selected tab , allowing you to add the component to a different tab .
- When you drop the component , in most cases , you will see a dialog to configure the properties of the component . Ensure that you have configured all the required properties of the component .
2 . In the form preview , select an existing field .
In most cases , a dialog is displayed so you can configure the properties of the component . Ensure that you have configured all the required properties of the component .
7 . Repeat steps 2-6 above if you want to add more components to the same or another field .
# # Configure components on a form
5 . Repeat steps 2-4 to configure more components on the same or another field .
# # Move components on a form
You can move components on a form by either drag-and-drop or cut-and-paste actions .
# # # Move components on a form using drag and drop
- Components can also be dropped in the empty area within a section . In this case the component will be added in an available space to evenly distribute components and fields across the section columns .
4 . Repeat steps 2-3 above to move more components .
# # # Move components on a form using cut and paste
2 . In the form preview , select the component that you want to move .
6 . Repeat steps 2-5 above if you want to move more components .
# # Delete components on a form
3 . Repeat step 2 if you want to delete more components .
&gt; - You can &apos;t delete a component that is locked or is using a required field that is not present anywhere else on the form .
Azure components and services that are involved with Relevance Search functionality are detailed in the following sections .
- Configuration data related to the organization and the corresponding index
- Metadata relating to the search service and indexes
- Authorization data to enable enhanced row- level security
# What are model-driven apps in Power Apps ?
Model-driven app design provides the following benefits :
- Rich component-focused no-code design environments
- Create complex responsive apps with a similar UI across a variety of devices from desktop to mobile
- Rich design capability
- Your app can be distributed as a solution
# # The approach to model-driven app making
At a fundamental level , model-driven app making consists of three key focus areas .
- Modeling business data
- Defining business processes
- Composing the app
# # # Modeling business data
# # # Defining business processes
# # # Composing the model-driven app
After modeling data and defining processes , you build your app by selecting and configuring the components you need using the app designer .
# Using quick find to search for records
Single-entity quick find is used to find records of only one type . This search option is available from within a view .
# # Multiple-entity quick find ( categorized search )
With categorized search , you can search for records that begin with a specific word or use a wildcard character .
&gt; Using a wildcard at the beginning of your quick find ( single or multiple-entity ) search query might result in slower performance .
# # Filter categorized search results
&gt; Apps and flows that use these entities require the app and flow user to be licensed appropriately-not the maker or developer of the app or flow .
# # Entities with complex business logic
# # # Impacting license requirements when adding complex business logic
Barb is creating two canvas apps :
Isaac is creating two model-driven apps :
Barb and Isaac need the following licenses :
App users need the following licenses :
Now , let &apos;s see what happens when Isaac adds a real-time workflow to the custom entity that both Barb and Isaac are using in their apps .
# Set function in Power Apps
Sets the value of a global variable .
As the examples later in this topic show , global variables can hold several kinds of information , including these :
* a single value
* a record
* a table
* an object reference
* any result from a formula

# Show a list of items in Power Apps
- Set up the sample data :
- Open a blank app :
# # Add a gallery to a blank screen
The * * Gallery * * control shows the sample data .
# # Add a control to the Gallery control
# # Filter and sort a gallery
1 . Double-click the search box , and then type part or all of a product name in it .
Only those items that meet the filter criterion appear .
1 . While pressing the Alt key , select the sort icon one or more times to switch the sort order .
The records toggle between ascending and descending alphabetical order based on the product name .
# # Highlight the selected item
# # Change the default selection
# Reference information about the meeting-screen template for canvas apps
Several other controls in the screen have a dependency on this one :
This control allows users to add people who don &apos;t exist inside their org to the attendee list for the meeting being composed .
At a low level , this code block :
# # # People browse gallery Title
Displays the person &apos;s display name from their Office 365 profile .
Value : Logic to allow the gallery to grow to a maximum height of 350 :
When the maximum height of the gallery is reached ( 350 ) , the scroll bar is visible .
At a high level , selecting this control removes the person from the attendee list and refreshes the available meeting times based on the removal of this person .
# # # Find meeting times gallery Title
1 . If the user has no room list or one room list :
Value : Logically set to two internal collections of identical schema , depending on whether the user has selected a room list or has rooms lists in their tenant :
The gallery is visible only if the three preceding statements evaluate to * * true * * .
At a low level , the preceding code block :
1 . Checks to see if a room list has been selected , and if the tenant has room lists . If so :
This control is visible only if both a room list has been selected and the * * Schedule * * tab is selected .
Value : Logic to force user to input certain meeting details before the icon becomes editable .
The icon is selectable only if the meeting subject is filled out , there is at least one attendee for the meeting , and a meeting time has been selected . Otherwise , it &apos;s disabled .
Value : Code to send the meeting invite to your selected attendees and clear all the input fields :
1 . Resets all of the input fields and variables used in creating the meeting .
Boolean logic functions , commonly used to manipulate the results of comparisons and tests .

# Create and manage website bindings
Website bindings can be created , edited , and deleted within Power Apps portals .
4 . To edit an existing website binding , select the website binding name .
# # # Website binding attributes
These are the attributes common to all bindings .
&#124; Release Date &#124; A date that determines when the website is allowed to be selected . &#124;
&#124; Expiration Date &#124; A date that determines when the website will stop being selected . &#124;
# # # # Application Settings
&#124; Site Name &#124; The name of the IIS website . &#124;
&#124; Virtual Path &#124; The name of the IIS application under the website . &#124;
# Container control in Power Apps ( experimental )
Provides the ability to create hierarchy .
&gt; This is an experimental feature . Experimental features can radically change or completely disappear at any time .
The container can hold a set of controls and has its own properties .
Containers don &apos;t work within forms .
The authoring group is a lightweight concept used for moving around controls and bulk editing similar properties of controls within the group . The authoring group doesn &apos;t affect the layout of the app .
The container control previously shipped in experimental as a replacement for the authoring group renamed as the enhanced group . It was renamed to the container control as there &apos;s value in both a lightweight authoring group and a structured container control with additional properties .
title : &quot; Rate or vote on a webpage on a portal &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# Rate or vote on a webpage on a portal
# # Enable ratings for pages
For webpages that have page ratings enabled and the developer has applied the control to the template , users can rate the page either by using the rating scale or voting , depending on the type chosen when the control was added to the page template .
The ratings for webpages can be viewed , modified , or deleted within Power Apps portals .
# # Cell format when data is exported from model-driven apps

If you ’ re using Excel 2010 , you might get this error message when you export data from the Accounts area :
The error message occurs due to a setting in Excel . To fix the issue , do this :
# # Limit the number of records that can be exported to Excel using Web API
Update the `maxrecordsforexporttoexcel` attribute of the Organization entity using the Web API .
The Web API request given below will set the value of `maxrecordsforexporttoexcel` attribute to 100 .
# Add a report from outside Power Apps
If you ’ ve created a custom report outside of the system , you can easily add it to Power Apps .
1 . From the left navigation pane , select the reports area .
* * Add a file created in another application * *
* * Add a link to a webpage * *
3 . Specify the properties for the report .
If no values are selected , the report won ’ t be visible to end users .
title : Create a summary form in a canvas app &#124; Microsoft Docs
# Create a summary form in a canvas app
# # Add a title bar
1 . Move and resize the new label to span the top of the screen :
- Increase the font size to 24 points .
- Make the text bold .
- Make the text white .
- Center the text .
- Add a dark-blue fill to the background .
# # Add an Edit form control
In this section , you &apos;ll add controls to show a summary of any order that the user selects in the gallery .
By default , the form appears in the upper-left corner , where other controls might make it difficult to find :
1 . Move and resize the form to cover the upper-right corner of the screen under the title bar :
1 . Scroll down until these fields appear , and then select their check boxes :
The form shows seven fields , which may be in a different order :
This step adds flexibility as you arrange the fields :
1 . Move and resize the fields by dragging their handles , just as you would any other control , so that each row contains these data cards in the specified order :
All selected controls disappear from the form :
# # Connect the order gallery
The form shows an summary of whatever order the app user selects in the list .
# # Replace a data card
The user can no longer change the order number :
1 . In the data card , reduce the width of the combo box to make room for the employee picture :
An image appears in the data card , which expands to accommodate it :
1 . Resize the image , and move it to the right of the combo box :
The picture of the selected employee appears .
1 . While holding down the Alt key , select a different employee in the combo box to confirm that the picture also changes .
# # Add a Save icon
The user can save changes to an order by selecting the Check icon , which is then disabled and dimmed until the user makes another change :
# # Add a Cancel icon
The icon appears in the upper-left corner by default , where other controls might make the icon difficult to find :
The user can cancel changes to an order , and the Check and Cancel icons are disabled and dimmed if all changes have been saved :
The formula disables the Add icon under these conditions :
- The user makes changes but doesn &apos;t save or cancel them , which is the opposite behavior from the Check and Cancel icons .
- The user selects the Add icon but makes no changes .
&gt; If you create and save an order , you might need to scroll down in the order gallery to show your new order . It won &apos;t have a total price because you haven &apos;t added any order details yet .
# # Add a Trash icon
The user can delete an order .
To recap , you added a form in which the user can show and edit a summary of each order , and you used these elements :
# # Add a form to your portal
The entity form contains relationships to webpages and additional properties to control the initialization of the form within the portal . The relationship to webpages allows dynamic retrieval of the form definition for a given page node within the website .
&gt; - Business rules and client API can enable locked fields on a read-only form .
&gt; - If you create an entity form in the Insert mode , you can &apos;t change a button &apos;s alignment or place an action button above the entity form .
&gt; - If you render a lookup control as a dropdown list on the form , the related records filter does not work .

Clicking on one of these options displays a configuration area for that action . Furthermore , certain entities have special actions that are available to them on a per-entity basis :
- Calculate Value of Opportunity ( opportunity )
- Convert Quote to Order ( quote )
- Convert Order to Invoice ( salesorder )
- Generate Quote from Opportunity ( opportunity )
- Lose Opportunity Action ( opportunity )
- Win Opportunity Action ( opportunity )
- Reopen Case Action ( incident )
- Set Opportunity on Hold ( opportunity )
# # Geolocation configuration for entity forms
The form &apos;s map control requires additional configuration to tell it what the IDs of the various location fields are , to assign values to them or retrieve values from them . The Entity Form record has a configuration section that defines these field mappings that you must specify . The field names will vary depending on the schema you have created .
&gt; - The address field in a read-only entity form is replaced with the map when geolocation is enabled .
&gt; - The Geolocation section is not visible in the German Sovereign Cloud environment . If a user has enabled geolocation by using a different form , it will not be displayed during rendering on portal .
By default , request validation is enabled on portal resulting in following generic error if you enter script code without HTML encoding inside entity form fields :
To disable request validation , follow these steps :
1 . Select appropriate web site record .
1 . Type appropriate description .
&gt; When request validation is disabled , content can be submitted to a page . You must ensure that content is properly encoded or processed .

By combining conditions and actions , you can do any of the following with business rules :
* Clear field values
* Set field requirement levels
* Show or hide fields
* Enable or disable fields
* Validate data and show error messages
* Create business recommendations based on business intelligence .
# # Differences between canvas and model-driven apps
# # Create a business rule
The Business Rule designer window opens with a single condition already created for you . Every rule starts with a condition . The business rule takes one or more actions based on that condition .
&gt; If you want to modify an existing business rule , you must deactivate it before you can modify it .
5 . Add a description , if you want , in the description box in the upper-left corner of the window .
6 . Set the scope , according to the following :
&gt; If you &apos;re building a Canvas app , you must use Entity as the scope .
&gt; Here are a few tips to keep in mind as you work on business rules in the designer window :
&gt; - Use the mini-map to navigate quickly to different parts of the process . This is useful when you have a complicated process that scrolls off the screen .
# # Localize error messages used in business rules
# RequestHide function in Power Apps
* No parameters .
# Add mixed reality components to your canvas app ( Preview )
Components are groups of controls that can answer the need for a specific scenario . For example , you can use these MR components to :
- View and manipulate 3D content .
- Overlay 3D content and 2D images onto the feed from the camera .
- Measure distance , area , and volume using your device with MR .
- Identify spaces in the real world through an MR overlay .
The following prebuilt components can be used for mixed reality scenarios :
For each app you create , you need to enable the mixed reality features :
4 . Return to editing your app by selecting the back arrow icon .
Start installing the components in your apps :
# Using relevance search to search for records
Relevance search delivers fast and comprehensive results across multiple entities , in a single list , sorted by relevance .
Relevance search brings the following enhancements and benefits :
- Improved performance compared to Categorized search .
- Finds matches to any word in the search term in any field in the entity , compared to quick find where all words from the search term must be found in one field .
- Highlights matches in the results list . When a search term matches a term in a record , the term appears as bold and italicized text in your search results .
&gt; - Highlighted terms are often returned as a portion of the full value in a field because only the matched terms are highlighted .
- Enables you to search for records that are shared with you and records that you own .
# # Switch between relevance search and categorized search
If your organization has turned on both search options ( relevance search and categorized search ) , you can switch between the two .
If your organization has turned on both search options , you can select a default search experience in your personal settings .
# # Filter records with facets
With Common Data Service , you can now refine your search results by using facets and filters . Facets and filters let you drill into and explore the results of your current search without having to repeatedly refine your search terms .
Facets are available in the leftmost pane . Immediately after you perform a search , the following global facets are available for four common fields :
- Created On
- Modified On
# # # Record Type facets
Search results that are found in email attachments or appointment entities are shown in the search results under their parent record , either Email or Appointment .
All lookups , option sets , and record types are text-based facets . For example , the text-based facet Owner consists of a list of field values and their corresponding counts .
# # # Date and Time facets
# # Configure facets and filters
&gt; A system customizer can set the default experience for all entities , but you can configure your own facets and filters .
&gt; - You &apos;ll only see the fields that exist in the default solution and that are configured as searchable by your system customizer .

Preview features aren ’ t meant for production use and may have restricted functionality . These features are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback .
# Create and edit global option sets overview
You can define an option set to use a set of options defined within itself ( locally ) or it can use a set of options defined elsewhere ( globally ) which can be used by other option set fields .
There are two designers you can use to create or edit global option sets :
&gt; You can also create global option sets in your environment using the following :
&gt; - Import a solution that contains the definition of the global option sets .
Information in this topic will help you choose which designer you can use .
- Assign colors to options
- Change the order of options
- Create a global option set in a solution other than the Common Data Service Default solution
- Set managed properties
- Set properties used for virtual entities
- View dependencies

Returns the current date and time , and tests whether a date / time value is today .
All these functions work with the local time of the current user .
When used in a data flow formula , a volatile function will only return a different value if the formula in which it appears is reevaluated . If nothing else changes in the formula then it will have the same value throughout the execution of your app .
The label continually shows the current time , down to the second .
The timer is invisible and starts automatically .
The label appears as soon as the app starts ( before the timer runs for a full second ) .

Once a portal is provisioned , you might need to delete resources from your portal under certain circumstances , such as if you move your organization to another tenant or another datacenter or if you want to remove the portal from your organization .
It is important to note that resetting your portal doesn ’ t remove portal configuration or solutions present in your instance and they will remain as is .
You can reset a completely configured portal , or a portal for which provisioning or updating of an instance has failed .
To reset a configured portal :

title : &quot; Identify and fix customer issues with a portal &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
Portal checker is a self-service diagnostic tool that can be used by portal administrators to identify common issues in their portal . Portal checker helps to identify issues with a portal by looking at various configuration parameters and it provides suggestions on how to fix them .
You can expand an issue to view detailed information and mitigation steps . If the mitigation requires any action , you &apos;ll see a button that will perform the action . You can also provide feedback on whether the mitigation was useful .
If required , you can rerun the diagnostic checks , which will refresh the results with updated data .
&gt; If portal is turned off or IP address filtering is enabled , certain diagnostic checks will not be run on your portal .
To run portal checker :
# Text input control in Power Apps
# # # Prompt for a password
1 . To return to the default workspace , press Esc .
# Refresh function in Power Apps

Depending on your choice you will see either :
&gt; With either choice , a lookup field will be created on the * current * entity .
Once you select the entity you can edit the details of the relationship . In this example , multiple contact entity records can be associated with a single account .
&gt; The publisher of a managed solution can prevent some customizations of relationships that are part of their solution .
Deleting the relationship will delete the lookup field on the related entity .
# Create a model-driven app system chart
In this topic you learn how to create a system chart . System charts are organization-owned charts , which makes them available to anyone with access to read the data running the app . System charts can &apos;t be assigned or shared with specific app users .
4 . Specify the type of chart , and how the data is displayed in the chart .
- Enter the chart name , such as * Number of employees by account * .
- Add a description to identify the purpose of the chart , such as * This column chart displays the number of employees by account name * .
In the chart designer , adding a order by on certain calculated fields are not supported and will cause an error . The calculated fields causing this are using another calculated fields , a related entity field , or a local field on the entity .
- You receive the following error message when configuring or using entity fields :
- When you create an environment along with the starter portal , the owner of the portal isn &apos;t displayed correctly . It &apos;s displayed as System .
# # Power Apps portals Studio issues

Then specify one or more change records , each of which contains new property values that override property values in the base record . Change records are processed in order from the beginning of the argument list to the end , with later property values overriding earlier ones .
# # # Modify or create a set of records in a data source
Instead of passing a single base record , a table of base records can be provided in the second argument . Change records are provided in a table as well , corresponding one-for-one with the base records . The number of records in each change table must be the same as the number of records in the base table .
# # # Merge records outside of a data source
Specify two or more records that you want to merge . Records are processed in the order from the beginning of the argument list to the end , with later property values overriding earlier ones .
After the previous formulas have been evaluated , the data source ends with these values :

When creating a new web page for the site , whether through front-side publishing or through the portal interface , you must select a page template which will present the page &apos;s content to users of the portal .
Creating a new Page Template is only necessary when creating a brand new .aspx page to display content on your website , a portal developer ’ s task . In fact , for the purposing of simply customizing the layout of your site , a portal developer can largely just modify existing .aspx pages .
4 . To edit an existing page template , select the page template name .

title : Announce dynamic changes with live regions in canvas apps &#124; Microsoft Docs
# Announce dynamic changes with live regions for canvas apps
You can solve this problem by adding live regions , which screen readers track . If content changes in a live region , a screen reader will announce that change .
# # Example uses of live regions
You can use live regions to notify users when events such as these occur :
* A validation error occurs in a form .
* The user selected a different tab .
# # Create and configure a live region
title : &quot; Visualize hierarchical data with model-driven apps &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# Visualize hierarchical data with model-driven apps
- A hierarchy or visualization is based on one entity only . You can depict the account hierarchy showing accounts at multiple levels , but you can ’ t show accounts and contacts in the same hierarchy visualization .
To enable visualizations for a hierarchy you must connect the hierarchy to a quick view form . This can only be done using solution explorer .
The hierarchy settings are associated to an entity in the solution explorer .
&gt; If the hierarchy settings do not exist the entity is not eligible to have a hierarchy configured .
&gt; There can be only one hierarchy setting
1 . Set the data in the following fields :
&gt; The hierarchy icons don ’ t appear in the record grid view until the records are related using the hierarchical relationship .
You can map attributes between entities that have an entity relationship . This lets you set default values for a record that is created in the context of another record .
# # Easier way to create new records in model-driven apps
# # # The easier way
The new contact record form will include any of the mapped attribute values from the account ( such as address and phone information ) as the default values . People can edit these values before they save the record .
&gt; These mappings only set default values to a record before it is saved . People can edit the values before saving . The data that is transferred is the data at that point in time . It isn ’ t synchronized if the source data later changes .
The only way to map entity fields is to use solution explorer .
Select one source entity field and one target entity fields with values you want to map .
The following rules show what kinds of data can be mapped .
- Both fields must be of the same type and the same format .
- The target field can ’ t be mapped to another field already .
- The source field must be visible on the form .
- The target field must be a field that a user can enter data into .
- Address ID values can ’ t be mapped .
- If you map to or from a field that isn ’ t displayed on a form , the mapping won &apos;t be done until the field is added to a form .
- If the fields are option sets , the integer values for each option should be identical .
# # Automatically generate field mappings
You should use care when doing this with system entities . Use this when you create custom entities and want to leverage mapping .
Because field mappings are not metadata , you must publish them before changes take effect .

The Excel Add-in automatically reads the data for the entity that you selected . Note that there will be no data in the workbook until the Excel Add-in reads it in .
# # View and refresh data in Excel
You can change entity data as you require and then publish it back by selecting * * Publish * * in the Excel Add-in .
To edit a record , select a cell in the worksheet , and then change the cell value .
To add a new record , follow one of these steps :
* Select in the last row of the worksheet , and then press the Tab key until the cursor moves out of the last column of that row , and a new row is created .
You can use the designer to adjust the columns and entities that are automatically added to the worksheet .
&gt; - Make sure to always include the ID and required fields in your workbook , as you may receive errors when publishing .
&gt; - When adding look up fields , make sure to add both the ID and the Display fields .
* Look up fields must be edited using the add-in to ensure the correct record is referenced , updating these fields via copy and past or typing directly into the field is not supported .

Connection roles are directly associated to a connection . To use a connection role , you must first add a connection to your record .
1 . To add or manage connections , select the record you want to manage like an opportunity .
&gt; If you have entered information before creating a new connection role , a warning dialog will be displayed asking if you would like to cancel and continue working on the connection or to go ahead and leave the current record you are working on .
You can also manage the connection role types that you want associate to the connection role .

# Understand record references and polymorphic lookups in canvas apps
In the next section , you &apos;ll start to explore these concepts by working with the * * Owner * * lookup .
# # Show the fields of a record owner
To show that field in the * * Account * * entity :
With these data sources in place , use this formula to display the name of either a user or a team :
Then replace the previous formula with this one :
# # Filter based on an owner
Congratulations — you &apos;ve finished the hardest aspect of working with a record reference . Other use cases are more straightforward because they don &apos;t access fields of the record . As a case in point , take filtering , which you &apos;ll explore in this section .
You can get a little fancier by supporting filtering by either a user or a team .
The app will display only one combo box at a time , depending on the state of the radio control . Because they &apos;re directly above one another , they &apos;ll appear to be the same control that changes its contents .
With these changes , you can show all records or filter them based on either a user or a team :
The formula is fully delegable . The portion that &apos;s comparing the radio-button values is a constant across all records and is evaluated before the rest of the filter is sent to Common Data Service .
# # Update the owner by using Patch
1 . Move the copied controls to the right of the gallery .
# # Show the owner by using a form

# # Show the fields of a customer
# # Understand Regarding lookup fields
What does it all mean ?
- When you write formulas , you must consider that the list of activity entities isn &apos;t fixed , and you can create your own . The formula must appropriately handle an activity entity that you didn &apos;t expect .
- Activity tasks and activities have a one-to-many relationship . You can easily ask for all faxes that relate to an account .
To explore this concept in the app :
1 . Add another screen .
1 . Insert a gallery control , resize it , and then move it to the left side of the screen .
1 . Add a second gallery , resize it , and then move it to the right side of the screen .
This step returns the filtered list of faxes for a given account .
As you select an item in the list of accounts , the list of faxes shows faxes for only that account .
You can show all activities by changing only one line in the previous example . Replace `Gallery2.Selected.Faxes` with `Gallery2.Selected.Activities` .
By using this formula , you can show the record type in a label control within the gallery :
When you create an entity , you can enable attachments .
As of this writing , canvas apps don &apos;t support activity parties .
These real-world stories show how enterprise customers are using Microsoft Power Platform and the patterns that successful makers have used to bring these solutions to life .

This can happen due to multiple reasons such as :
Additional differences between Power Apps portals with capacity-based licenses and add-on based licenses :
- Provisioning method is different for portals with capacity-based licenses from add-on based licenses .
You can create Power Apps portal with capacity-based license using steps described in following articles :
# # # When is an add-on portal in suspended state ?
You can configure a portal to redirect a user to a default page after signing in . To achieve this functionality , you can include a JavaScript code in the Home web template .
For example , if you want to redirect all users to the Forums page after signing in , you can include a JavaScript code in the Home web template as follows :
# # # I &apos;m getting an error that only one portal can be created .
# # # I &apos;m getting an error that I can &apos;t delete my portal .
If you don &apos;t have sufficient privileges to delete a portal , you &apos;ll see an error as follows :
If you don &apos;t have sufficient privileges to create a portal in an environment , you &apos;ll see an error as follows :
# # # I &apos;m getting the message : “ Your data isn ’ t quite ready ” .
Sometimes the database creation can take time and the correct status might not reflect on the home page . In this case , you &apos;ll see the following message :
# # # I &apos;m getting an error that portal creation is blocked in this tenant by global administrator
Contact your global administrator to enable creation of portals by non-administrators also .
# # # I &apos;m getting an error that I don &apos;t have appropriate license to access this website .
After you &apos;ve provisioned a portal , the option to change the portal audience is disabled .
&gt; - The changing of Dynamics 365 instance is applicable only to the portals provisioned using the older portal add-ons .
Portals consists of the following components :
Deleting a portal completely requires deleting the Portal website host and as uninstalling Portal solutions from your Common Data Service environment .
# # Common Data Service environment lifecycle
To associate your portal again to relevant organizations :
When a Common Data Service environment is restored from a backup , various changes are done in your organization that can break your portal &apos;s connection with the organization . To fix this issue :
- If the organization ID is the same after the restore operation , and portal solutions are also available :
Your portal will be restarted and a connection will be created with the organization again .
- If the organization ID is different after the restore operation , or portal solutions are deleted from your organization :
3 . Follow the instructions in the wizard .
Your portal will be restarted and start working again .
# # Debugging and fixing problems
When you enable diagnostic logging , you can search for particular errors that users report by using the Activity ID shown on the generic error page . The Activity ID is logged along with the error details and is useful to find the actual issue .
# # Portal administration and management
# # # How do I get new portal releases in my sandbox portal first before it gets applied to production ?
Below is a list of most common causes and their corresponding mitigation steps :
This issue occurs when the Common Data Service environment is put in administration mode either when changing organization from production to sandbox mode or manually by an organization administrator .
This issue occurs when the authentication connection between Dynamic 365 organization and portal is broken because either Common Data Service environment was restored from a backup or was deleted and recreated from a backup . To fix this issue :
This issue is typically a transient issue that can occur if the API requests to your Common Data Service environment has timed out . This issue will automatically mitigate itself once the API requests starts working . To mitigate this issue , you can also try restarting the portal :
If restarting the portal doesn &apos;t work and this issue is occurring for a long period of time , contact Microsoft support for help .
# # # # Website binding not found
4 . After you delete all website binding records , restart the portal .
Once you complete the above steps , your portal will restart and will recreate website binding record automatically .
There are situations in which portal won &apos;t be able to recreate website binding record automatically when the GUID of the website record available in your instance is different than the one created during default installation of portal . In this situation , do the following steps :
1 . Delete all website binding records related to your portal .
2 . Create a website binding record manually with following values :
- Leave all other fields blank .
3 . Once website binding record is recreated , restart your portal from Power Apps Portals admin center .
If portal reset and reprovision doesn &apos;t solve this issue , contact Microsoft support for help .
However , if you &apos;re seeing stale data for a long time in non-portal metadata entities , it can be because of variety of issues listed below :
# # # # Entities not enabled for cache invalidation
# # # # Organization not enabled for change tracking
Performance issues in portals can be caused by different kinds of configuration issues . All the out-of-the-box portal templates are tested for a different type of load conditions and configurations that can affect portal performance and below is the list of common portal configurations that can lead to performance issues in your portal .
Portal checker ( self-service diagnostic ) tool will also point out these issues by looking at your portal configuration .
# # # # Web page tracking enabled
2 . Go to Advanced find .
It &apos;s important to understand that if you &apos;re on Dynamics 365 Portals solution version 9.x , this field won &apos;t be displayed on the form and you might need to add it to the form first .
# # # # Web file tracking enabled
The portal checker tool will list all the web files that are enabled for page tracking . These files should be disabled by following these steps :
# # # # Login tracking enabled
The portal checker tool will check if login tracking is enabled for your portal and will show a failed check if it &apos;s enabled . Login tracking should be disabled by following these steps :
5 . Restart the portal .
# # # # Header output cache is disabled
The portal checker tool will check if header output cache is disabled on your portal and will show a failed check if it &apos;s disabled . To enable it :
# # # # Footer output cache is disabled
The portal checker tool will check if footer output cache is disabled on your portal and will show a failed check if it &apos;s disabled . To enable it :
# # # # Large number of web file records
- Use an external file server like Azure blob storage or CDN to store these files and then reference these files on the appropriate pages either within the page or in underlying template .
1 . Create a dummy web page with no content and a blank template . This page would be used to create a direct path to your web files .
3 . Reference your web file directly in the HTML of the page template or web template of the page where you want to use it . This will load your file on demand on that page .
When working on portal implementation , it &apos;s important to understand that you completely manage the HTML of the page . That means , the standard web development practices should be followed to ensure that your webpage &apos;s client side performance isn &apos;t affected .
To avoid this , you can do the following steps :
1 . If a web file isn &apos;t needed on the home page , make sure its parent page isn &apos;t set as home page and reuse the mechanism described above to load it on demand .
# # # # Entity form lookup configuration
# # # An active Home site marker isn &apos;t available for this portal
3 . Create a new site marker with following values :
# # # The Home site marker isn &apos;t pointing to any webpage
# # # The Home site marker is pointing to a deactivated web page
# # # The Home site marker isn &apos;t pointing to home page of the portal
# # # An active Profile site marker isn &apos;t available for this portal
# # # The Profile site marker isn &apos;t pointing to any webpage
# # # The Profile site marker is pointing to a deactivated web page
# # # An active Page Not Found site marker isn &apos;t available for this portal
# # # The Page Not Found site marker isn &apos;t pointing to any webpage
# # # The Page Not Found site marker is pointing to a deactivated web page
# # # An active Access Denied site marker isn &apos;t available for this portal
# # # The Access Denied site marker isn &apos;t pointing to any webpage
# # # The Access Denied site marker is pointing to a deactivated web page
# # # Profile web form isn &apos;t available for contact entity
# # # Published state isn &apos;t available for this website
To fix this issue , ensure that the publishing state entity * * Published * * is available and active .
# # # Published state isn &apos;t visible
# # # List of entities with search result having invalid URL
# # # List of entities with CMS security check failed
To fix this issue , ensure that your entity has proper search page .
# # # Web file isn &apos;t active
To fix this issue , ensure that the web file is in active state .
# # # The partial URL of web file is misconfigured
To fix this issue , ensure that the partial URL is the file name with Home as the root page .
# # # Web file doesn &apos;t have a file attachment
To fix this issue , add the corresponding CSS file in the notes section of the web file .
# # # File attachment doesn &apos;t have content
To fix this issue , add the CSS file with entire content in the notes section of the web file .
To fix this issue , ensure that there are no plugins or flows that override the MIME type of the CSS file ( s ) .
# Assign model-driven app form order
You can &apos;t assign security roles to quick create , quick view , or card forms , so the only form that will be used by everyone is the one at the top of the form order .
# # To assign a form order
&#91; Change navigation within a form &#93; ( use-the-form-editor-legacy.md )
# # Delete a custom entity
# # Delete an entity that has dependencies
You can ’ t delete an entity while it has a dependency on another component , such as a business process flow or a model-driven app .
There are two ways that you can remove a dependency :
- Delete the component .
# # # Remove a dependency

# Use faceted search to improve portal search
Portal content may be searched by using filters based on characteristics of the content . The filters implemented by faceted portal search allow customers to find the content they want more quickly than a traditional search .
# # Enable or disable faceted search
Out-of-the-box faceted search is enabled in your portals . To control or enable it , follow these steps :
To disable a single piece of the faceted view :
2 . Select the view to disable ( that is , Knowledge Management – Top Rated Articles )
# # Group entities as part of a record type for faceted view
# # Use faceted search to improve knowledge search results
title : &quot; Privileges required for model-driven app customizing &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# Privileges required for model-driven app customization
App users can personalize the system and even share some of their customizations with others , but only users with the correct privileges can apply changes for everyone .
# # System Administrator and System Customizer security roles
Anyone who customizes will have the System Administrator or System Customizer security role associated with their account . These security roles give you the permissions you need to customize the app .
&#124; System Administrator &#124; System Customizer &#124;
&#124; Has full permission to customize the system &#124; Has full permission to customize the system &#124;
You might want to delegate some tasks to trusted people so that they can apply changes they need . Keep in mind that anyone can have multiple security roles associated with their user account and that privileges and access rights granted by security roles is based on the * least restrictive * level of permissions .
This means that you can give the System Customizer security role to someone who already has another security role , perhaps a sales manager . This lets them customize the system in addition to other privileges they already have . You don ’ t need to edit the security role they already have , and you can remove the System Customizer security role from the person ’ s user account when you want .
# # Test customizations without customization privileges
# Text function in Power Apps
Converts any value and formats a number or date / time value to a string of text .
# # # Date and time placeholders
To specify the language of the custom format , use :
The language placeholder can appear anywhere in the custom format but only once .
# # # Result language tag
# # # Date / Time
* United States Pacific Time Zone ( UTC-8 )

# What is an on-premises data gateway ?
# # How the gateway works
There are two different types of gateways , each for a different scenario :
There are four main steps for using a gateway .
For internal use only .
To create an entity , you must have either a System Administrator or System Customizer security role within Common Data Service .

title : &quot; Add a webpage to render a list of records on a portal &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
An entity list is a data-driven configuration that you use to add a webpage that will render a list of records without the need for a developer to surface the grid in the portal . By using entity lists , you can expose records for display on portals .
# # Add an entity list to your portal
&gt; - An entity list must be associated with a webpage in a given website for the list to be viewable within the site .
&gt; - Multi-select option set is not supported in entity lists .
# # Entity list attributes and relationships
&#124; Entity Name &#124; The name of the entity from which the Saved Query view will be loaded . This field is required . &#124;
&#124; Account Attribute &#124; An optional lookup attribute on the primary entity that represents an account record to which the current user contact &apos;s parent Customer account value can be applied to filter the data rendered in the list . &#124;
&#124; Website Attribute &#124; An optional lookup attribute on the primary entity that represents the website to which the current website &apos;s ID can be applied to filter the data rendered in the list . &#124;

# # Adding a view details page
By setting the Web Page for Details View lookup to a webpage , the details of a record listed in the grid can be viewed as read-only or edited , depending on the configuration of the associated form or page .
* * Using an entity form to display details * *
The following are the important settings to be aware of for ensuring that the record from the entity list is loaded in the entity form .
The Record ID Query String Parameter Name on Entity Form must match the ID Query String Parameter Name on Entity List .
The Mode can be either Edit or ReadOnly , depending on your needs .
* * Using a Web form to display details * *
The following are the important settings to be aware of for ensuring that the record from the entity list is loaded in the Web form .
The Primary Key Query String Parameter Name on Web Form Step must match the ID Query String Parameter Name on Entity List .
* * Using a details page for the Create function * *
If you assign a webpage to the Create Lookup on the entity list and do not specify a Create action by using Configuration , a Create button will be rendered on the list ; this button will link the user to the custom page you have designated for Create .
# # Entity list filter configuration
&#124; Attribute Filter Set &#124; Filter the entity list by using a series of check boxes , each of which tries to match its condition against a particular attribute of the given entity . &#124;
The Text filter adds a text box to the entity list Filter area that is tied to an attribute of the entity type of the entity list . When a user applies the filter , the entity list only displays those records whose selected attribute contains the value .
The Text filter uses the following attributes :
The Attribute Filter Set adds a series of options to filter the entity list by , tied to a single attribute of the entity list &apos;s selected entity type . When a user applies the filter , the entity list only displays those records that exactly match at least one of the selected options .
The Attribute Filter Set uses the following attributes :
&#124; Display Name &#124; Override the label for the filter when the entity list is displayed . By default , this will be automatically set to the name of the selected attribute .
Options have the following attributes :
&#124; Value &#124; The actual value used for this filter condition . &#124;
The Lookup Set adds a series of options to filter the entity list by , tied to a related entity to the entity list &apos;s selected entity type . When a user applies the filter , the entity list only displays those records that exactly match at least one of the selected related records .
A Lookup Set can typically have any number of options , with the only limit being the number of related records of the selected related type .
&#124; Value &#124; The record of the selected related type to filter by . &#124;
The Range Filter Set uses the following attributes :
A Range Filter Set can have any number of options . Each option will produce a filter condition with either one or two subconditions , both of which must be met for the condition to be true .
The Dynamic Picklist Set uses the following options :
&#124; Attribute &#124; The name of the Picklist attribute on the entity list &apos;s selected entity type to filter by . &#124;
The Dynamic Lookup Set adds a dynamic series of options to filter the entity list by , tied to a related entity to the entity list &apos;s selected entity type . When a user applies the filter , the entity list only displays those records that exactly match at least one of the selected related records .
The Dynamic Lookup Set uses the following options :
&#124; Label Column &#124; The field from the view that provides each entity &apos;s Name value . &#124;
The range filter can create either a simple text box filter like the Text filter or a set of options like the other filter types . It allows you to manually create virtually any type of filter for the entity list by using FetchXML .
The FetchXML filter uses only one attribute :
&#124; FetchXML &#124; The XML statement representing the filter . &#124;
# # Entity list Map view
&gt; This option is not supported in the German Sovereign Cloud environment . The Map view section will not be visible in this environment .
# # Entity List Calendar view
Use the Entity List Calendar view to render an entity list as a calendar , with each individual record configured to act as a single event .
# # Entity list OData feeds
# # Enhanced view filter for entity lists

title : &quot; Gather feedback by using polls on a portal &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# Gather feedback by using polls on a portal
Polls give your web audiences a quick and easy way to voice their opinion on specific topics , and then immediately and automatically see feedback from their vote .
# # Add a poll to the page
# # Create a poll placement
To create a new poll placement region :
A new poll can be created in two ways :
&#124; Name &#124; The descriptive name of the poll . &#124;
&#124; Submit Button Label &#124; The text that is to be used for the submission button . &#124;
&#124; Expiration Date &#124; Controls the date / time prior to which the poll will be visible on the portal . &#124;
&#124; Close Voting Date &#124; Until this date , users who have not yet voted on a poll can vote on the poll . &#124;
&#124; Name &#124; The descriptive name for the poll option . &#124;
&#124; Poll &#124; The poll that the option is associated with . &#124;
&#124; Answer &#124; The text to display as an available poll voting option . &#124;
&#124; Display Order &#124; A numeric value that will determine the display order of the poll options . &#124;
When a user visits the website , they will be given the opportunity to vote on the poll displayed on the page .
Users can vote only one time ; after this , if the poll is displayed , they will see the results for that poll .
The details of the poll voting results are stored in Common Data Service as Poll Submission records . The Poll Submission entity contains the following information :
&#124; Poll Option &#124; The poll option that the user selected . &#124;
&#124; Contact &#124; The associated Contact record of the voter if the user is signed in . &#124;
&#124; Visitor ID &#124; The anonymous ID of the voter if the user is anonymous . &#124;

Some filters accept parameters . Filters can also be combined , and are applied in order from left to right .
The below section describes various filters .
Divides an array into multiple arrays of a given size .
Concatenates two arrays into a single new array .
Returns the first element of an array .
first can also be used with a special dot notation , in cases where it needs to be used inside a tag .
Joins the elements of an array with the character passed as the parameter . The result is a single string .
Returns the last element of an array .
last can also be used with a special dot notation , in cases where it needs to be used inside a tag .
Returns the elements of an array ordered by a given attribute of the elements of the array .
Optionally , you can provide desc as a second parameter to sort the elements in descending order , rather than ascending .
Returns a single randomly-selected item from the array .
Selects the value of a given attribute for each item in an array , and returns these values as an array .
Applied to an array , returns a new array with the same items , in randomized order .
Returns the number of items in an array .
size can also be used with a special dot notation , in cases where it needs to be used inside a tag .
Skips a given number of items in an array , and returns the rest .
Takes a given number of items from the array , returning the taken items .
Select all the objects in an array where a given attribute has a given value .
Date filters can be used for date arithmetic or to convert DateTime values into various formats .
Formats a DateTime value using a .NET format string .
Adds the specified number of whole and fractional days to the DateTime value . The parameter can be positive or negative .
Adds the specified number of whole and fractional hours to the DateTime value . The parameter can be positive or negative .
Adds the specified number of whole and fractional minutes to the DateTime value . The parameter can be positive or negative .
Adds the specified number of whole months to the DateTime value . The parameter can be positive or negative .
Adds the specified number of whole years to the DateTime value . The parameter can be positive or negative .
# # Entity list filters
Given a sort expression , returns the current sort direction for a given attribute .
Given a sort direction , returns the opposite sort direction .
As with all filters , math filters can be chained , and are applied in order from left to right .
Rounds a value up to the nearest integer .
Divides a number by another number .
Rounds a value down to the nearest integer .
Subtracts a number from another number .
Divides a number by another number and returns the remainder .

The split filter takes on a substring as a parameter . The substring is used as a delimiter to divide a string into an array .
Strips all HTML tags from a string .
Strips any line breaks from a string .
Truncates a string down to a given number of characters . An ellipsis ( ... ) is appended to the string and is included in the character count .

Converts a string into uppercase .
URI-escape a string , for inclusion in a URL .
XML-escape a string , for inclusion in XML output .
Type filters allow you to convert values of one type into other types .
URL filters allow you to build or extract parts of URLs .
Appends a query string parameter to a URL . If the parameter already exists in the URL , the parameter value will be updated .
If this filter is applied to a full absolute URL , an updated absolute URL will be the result . If it is applied to a path , an updated path will be the result .
Gets the base URL of a given URL .
Gets the host part of a URL .
Gets the path part of a URL .
Gets the path and query part of a URL .
Gets the port number of a URL .
Gets the scheme part of a URL .
These filters provide useful general functionality .
Returns a default value for any variable with no assigned value ( i.e. null ) .
Applied to a number value representing a number of bytes , returns a formatted file size with a unit of appropriate scale .
Optionally , a precision parameter can be passed , to control the number of decimal places in the result . The default precision is 1 .
Renders a string as Liquid code . This code will have access to the current Liquid execution context ( variables , etc . ) .
&gt; This filter should be used with caution and should generally only be applied to values that are under the exclusive control of portal content authors , or other users that can be trusted to write Liquid code .
# Timer control in Power Apps
A control that can determine how your app responds after a certain amount of time passes .
Timers can , for example , determine how long a control appears or change other properties of a control after a certain amount of time has passed .
&gt; In Power Apps Studio , timers run only in Preview mode .
# # # Show a countdown
The label shows how many seconds remain before the timer restarts .
Any of these strategies is sufficient :
* Allow users to cancel the timed event .
* Allow users to adjust the time limit before it begins .
* Warn 20 seconds before the time limit expires and provide an easy way to extend the limit .
&gt; If the timer is visible and running , screen readers will announce the elapsed time every five seconds .
It ’ s easy to get back to the customer data you were working with most recently .
Use calculated fields to automate manual calculations used in your business processes .
- Calculated fields use the fields from the current entity or related parent entities .
- A seamless integration of the calculated fields with the forms , views , charts , and reports is available in real time .
- You can configure calculated fields to use custom controls .
# # Create a calculated field
These are the types of fields that support calculations :
- Two Options
- Date Time
&gt; Note that field level security will be ignored on the related entity , so if there is sensitive data in the accessed field we suggest securing your calculated field as well .
Let ’ s take a look at calculated field examples in more detail .
# # # Weighted revenue of opportunity
# # # # Set the condition on the opportunities :
# # # # Altogether :
# # # Follow-up date of opportunity
In this example , we are using the fields of the originated lead of an opportunity to calculate the appropriate date when to follow up on the opportunity .
In the calculated field definition editor , in the * * Condition * * section , we specify two conditions the purchase time frame and the estimated value of the lead .
In the * * ACTION * * , we provide two formulas :
- To follow up in one week on the immediate opportunity
- To follow up in one month if the opportunity is not likely to happen right away .
# # # # Set the two conditions on the originating lead :
# # # # Provide the formula to follow up in one week :
# # # # Provide the formula to follow up in one month :
# # # Days from a record creation
Create a new Whole Number field called * * Calculated difference in days * * .
# # # # Provide the formula for computing the difference in days
&gt; The function names are specified in uppercase letters .
&#124; Function Syntax &#124; Description &#124; Return type &#124;
You should be aware of certain conditions and limitations when working with calculated fields :
- The calculated field values are not displayed in the Outlook Client Offline mode in the tile views or on entity main forms .
- A maximum number of chained calculated fields is 5 .
- A calculated field can ’ t refer to itself or have cyclic chains .
- Sorting is disabled on :
- A calculated field that contains a field of a parent record .
- A calculated field that contains a logical field ( for example , address field )
- A calculated field that contains another calculated field .
- Calculated fields can span two entities only .
- A calculated field can contain a field from another entity ( spanning two entities – current entity and parent record ) .
- A calculated field can ’ t contain a calculated field from another entity that also contains another field from a different entity ( spanning three entities ) :
- You can ’ t change an existing simple field to a calculated field . If your current application is using JavaScript or plug-ins to calculate a field , you would not be able to use the calculated fields feature without creating a new field .
- Duplicate detection rules are not triggered on calculated fields .
- A rollup can &apos;t reference a calculated field that uses another calculated field , even if all the fields of the other calculated field are on the current entity .
# Walk end-to-end through the completed SharePoint Online integration scenario
4 . Fill out the form with the following values :
7 . Verify the new entry in the list .
# # Step 2 : Approve the project
3 . Check the inbox of the requestor &apos;s email account , and you should see an approval email .
4 . Verify the updated entry in the list .
The change is applied to the list , and the gallery refreshes so only the remaining unassigned project is displayed .
6 . Close the app , and go back to the SharePoint list . You &apos;ll see that the project entry is now updated with the project manager name .
# # Step 4 : Add time estimates for the project
6 . Close the app , and go back to the list . You &apos;ll see that the project entry is now updated with the date and day changes .
# # Step 5 : Review report data for existing projects
3 . Review the variance visualization .
As we noted when we created this visualization , there is a lot more variance for projects that were run by Irvin Sayers versus Joni Sherman .
4 . Drill into the visualization , and you see that much of the variance comes from two projects that took a lot longer than projected .
5 . Review the table that shows how long it takes for projects to go from approval to projected start date .
As we noted when we created this visualization , the projects that Irvin Sayers is assigned to take longer to start , with two projects taking much longer than the rest .
This can take some time , so check back if you don &apos;t see it right away .
3 . Open the Notification Center to see the details of the alert that fired .
6 . Now that you have information on pending projects , you can go back and approve any that have been waiting for your attention .
That brings us to the conclusion of our end-to-end walkthrough and this series of tutorials . We encourage you to continue your journey at the following sites :

# Power Apps visual for Power BI
# # Using the Power Apps visual
Let &apos;s look at the steps required to use the Power Apps visual in your Power BI report .
2 . Add the Power Apps visual to your report , and set the data fields associated with it .
3 . If you choose to create an app , you can choose in which environment to create it .
7 . You &apos;ve created a report in which your users can take actions as they gain insights from your data .
# # Limitations of the Power Apps visual
The following limitations apply to the Power Apps visual :
- Power Apps visual isn &apos;t supported in sovereign clouds .
- The Power Apps visual can &apos;t filter the data or send any data back to the report .
- Following limitations apply when using the `PowerBIIntegration.Refresh ( ) ` function :
- The Power BI mobile app doesn &apos;t support microphone control in Power Apps visuals .
&gt; We recommend that you first publish your report to the Power BI service and then create or modify apps .
&#124; Browser &#124; View &#124; Create &#124; Modify
To navigate the Power Apps visual using the keyboard , follow these steps :
# Create and edit virtual entities that contain data from an external data source
- Developers can implement plugins to read external data using the Common Data Service web services and Plug-in Registration tool .
# # Add a data source to use for virtual entities
# # # Add a secured field to a Data Source
&gt; The Data Source Secret attribute is only available with fields added to a Data Source form .
# # Create a virtual entity
You create a virtual entity just like any other entity in Common Data Service with the addition of a few extra attributes described here . Virtual entities must be created using solution explorer .
# # # Open solution explorer
# # # Create a virtual entity
1 . On the Entity Definition , complete the following required fields .
# # Considerations when you use virtual entities
Virtual entities have these restrictions .
- All virtual entities are read-only .
- Existing entities cannot be converted to virtual entities .
- Virtual entities don &apos;t support custom fields with the Currency , Image , or Customer data types .
- Virtual entities don &apos;t support auditing .
- Virtual entity fields can &apos;t be used in rollups or calculated fields .
- A virtual entity can &apos;t be an activity type of entity .
The custom block of JavaScript will be added to the bottom of the page just before the closing form tag element .
# # Additional client-side field validation
Sometimes you might need to customize the validation of fields on the form . The following example demonstrates adding a custom validator . This example forces the user to specify an email only if the other field for preferred method of contact is set to Email .
&gt; The client-side field validation is not supported in a subgrid .
# Create accessible canvas apps in Power Apps
Common sense and uncomplicated design helps apps be more accessible to all users . When doing heavy customization of apps take note of the below suggestions . Power Apps themes are designed to meet accessibility standards .
- Ensure all elements are clearly visible and text is of sufficient size . All content must be easily read and understood by the naked eye .
- Avoid using the visibility property of items to bring an element into view . If you need to show something conditionally , create the content in a new screen and navigate to it and back .

# Define rollup fields that aggregate values
Rollup fields help users obtain insights into data by monitoring key business metrics . A rollup field contains an aggregate value computed over the records related to a specified record . This includes regular entities and activity entities such as emails and appointments .
The benefits and capabilities of rollup fields include the following :
- Visual editing is easy . You can create rollup fields by using the Field Editor , just like you do when you create a regular field .
- Seamless integration with the user interface . You can include the rollup fields in forms , views , charts and reports .
- Rollup fields are solution components . You can easily transport the rollup fields as components between environments and distribute them in solutions .
- Rollup fields and the calculated fields are complementary to each other . You can use a rollup field as a part of the calculated field , and vice versa .
Some examples of rollup fields include :
- Total estimated revenue of open opportunities of an account
- Total estimated revenue of open opportunities across all accounts in a hierarchy
- Total estimated revenue of an opportunity including child opportunities
- Total estimated value of qualified leads generated by a campaign
- Number of high priority open cases across all accounts in a hierarchy
- Earliest created time of all high priority open cases for an account
The rollups are calculated by scheduled system jobs that run asynchronously in the background . You have to be an administrator to view and manage the rollup jobs .
To view rollup jobs :
# # # Mass Calculate Rollup Field
There are a few considerations you should keep in mind when using the online recalculation option ( manual refresh on the form ) :
- This option is only available in the online mode . You can ’ t use it while working offline .
As a system administrator , you can modify the rollup job recurrence pattern , postpone , pause , or resume the rollup job . However , you can ’ t cancel or delete a rollup job .
In this example , a hierarchy is not used . The total estimated revenue is calculated for an account , from the related open opportunities .
In this example , we calculate the total estimated revenue of an opportunity including the child opportunities , over the hierarchy .
In this example , we calculate the total estimated revenue of open opportunities across all accounts , over the hierarchy .
In this example , we calculate the total time spent and billed from all activities related to an account . This may include time spent on the phone , at appointments , or on custom activities .
In this example , we calculate an average estimated revenue from all opportunities related to an account .
The following example shows how to calculate an average estimated revenue from related opportunities over a hierarchy of accounts . An average estimated revenue can be seen at each level in the hierarchy .
- A workflow can ’ t be triggered by the rollup field updates .
- A workflow wait condition cannot use a rollup field .
- A rollup over the rollup field is not supported .
- The rollup can only apply filters to the source entity or related entities , simple fields or non-complex calculated fields .
- A rollup can ’ t be done over the 1 : N relationship for the Activity entity or the Activity Party entity .
- The business rules , workflows or calculated fields always use the last calculated value of the rollup field .
As you can see , the precision rounding to two decimal points on the aggregated field is done before the aggregation is performed .
# # # Different behavior from Associated grids
1 . The rollup field on the account entity , called Total Number of Cases , is used to count the cases associated with the account .
# Behavior and format of the date and time field
&gt; The behavior of this field can ’ t be changed after it ’ s saved .
You can also override the default date / time format to be used on portals by creating the following site settings :
By default , the portal uses the standard date / time formats specified by the website language settings .

title : &quot; Merge duplicate records &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# # # How to merge duplicate records
There are a few situations when duplicates may be found :
- When a record is created or updated .
- When you import data using the Import Data wizard .
- Duplicates aren &apos;t detected when you merge records , save an activity as completed , or change the status of a record , such as activating or reactivating a record .
&gt; If a field or control matches any of the following conditions , it will not show up in the merge dialog :
&gt; - The containing section is invisible in form descriptor or form XML regardless whether the section shows up in runtime . It is possible to show it using the client API .
&gt; - The control does not have a class property .
&gt; - The attribute is `Picklist` or `MultiSelectPickList` and it has either a parent picklist or child picklist attribute .
&gt; - The attribute is ` parentaccountid` on the Account entity ; this is a system setting and cannot be changed .
&gt; - The attribute is ` parentcustomerid` on the Contact Entity ; this is a system setting and cannot be changed
These functions return no values .
Get the number of characters in a string with the size property .
Numbers can be integers or floats .
A Boolean is either true or false .
A DateTime object represents a specific date and time .
Null represents an empty or non-existent value . Any outputs that attempt to return a null value will render nothing . It will be treated as false in conditions .

title : &quot; Clear the server-side cache for a portal &quot;
# Clear the server-side cache for a portal
# # Steps to clear portal server-side cache
To clear the server-side cache :
The server-side cache is deleted , and data is reloaded from Common Data Service .
# # # List of configuration entities refreshed when you clear config
Clearing the server-side configuration cache for a portal includes refreshing the data from the following * configuration entities * :
# # Caching changes for portals with version 9.2.6.x or later
Power Apps portals with version 9.2.6.x or later benefit from improved caching functionality to increase consistency and reliability as follows .
- Add-on portals with high load will have improved performance and a reliable data cache refresh .
This design approach isn &apos;t recommended . Except the primary record where the create or update action is triggered , data reflection from Common data Service to portals is never guaranteed to be immediate .
Immediately , as long as the update changes a primary record and isn &apos;t based on indirect changes to data using plugins or workflows .
# Take measurements in mixed reality ( Preview )
The component creates a button in your app . When app users click the button , it shows a live camera feed of the device . App users can then identify a starting point and then individual points to measure from . The distances of measured segments are shown directly on the live camera feed .
An example of how the component works inside an app is shown in the following video :

# Define and query hierarchically related data
You can get valuable business insights by defining and querying hierarchically related data . The hierarchical modelling and visualization capabilities give you a number of benefits :
&gt; * Self-referential * means that the entity is related to itself . For example , the account entity has a lookup field to associate it with another account entity record .
To turn the hierarchy on :
&gt; Unless you are certain that there are no other dependencies on the existing hierarchy , you should review any documentation about the deployment or confer with other customizers to understand how the existing hierarchical relationship is used before continuing .
The following examples illustrate scenarios for querying hierarchies :
# # # Query account hierarchy , including related activities
# # # Query account hierarchy , including related opportunities
# Power Apps Common Data Service entity tags
Visualization ID of the chart . You can get this by exporting the chart .
ID of the entity when opened in view editor .
The powerbi tag accepts the following parameters :
Path of the Power BI report or dashboard . If the Power BI report or dashboard is secure , you must provide the authentication type .
&gt; The values for the `authentication _ type` parameter are case insensitive .
You can also filter the report on one or more values . The syntax to filter a report is :
The complete code will be :
&gt; Anonymous report doesn &apos;t support filtering .
You can also create a dynamic path by using the `capture ` Liquid variable as below :
Displays the specified tile of the dashboard . You must provide the ID of the tile .
&gt; Use the `webroles` variable as follows in the Liquid tag :
After these initial parameters , the tag supports a number of optional named parameters .

A default value to be rendered in the case that the editable item has no value .
A Boolean value indicating whether a value rendered by this tag will be HTML-encoded . This is false by default .
A Boolean value indicating whether any Liquid template code found within the text value rendered by this tag will be processed . This is true by default .
If the entity list is loaded successfully , the content within the block will be rendered . If the entity list is not found , the block content will not be rendered .
By default , the entitylist object will be given the variable name entitylist . Optionally , a different variable name can be provided .
Generally , literal GUID strings will not be used . Instead , id will be specified using a GUID property of another variable .
Loads an entity list by name .
If the view is loaded successfully , the content within the block will be rendered . If the view is not found , the block content will not be rendered .
By default , the entityview object will be given the variable name entityview . Optionally , a different variable name can be provided .
id must be a string that can be parsed as a GUID .
The Power Apps entity logical name of the view to be loaded . Must be used in combination with name .
Specifies whether to filter the view results by user or account . Must have a string value of user or account .
Specifies the view result page to load . If this parameter is not specified , the first page of results will be loaded .
Specifies a search expression by which to filter view results . Simple keyword search expressions will filter by whether attributes begin with the keyword . Wildcards \ * can also be included in the expression .
By default , the search index object will be given the variable name searchindex . Optionally , a different variable name can be provided .
The searchindex tag accepts the following parameters .
The query used to match results . This parameter is intended to accept the user-specified part of the index query ( if any ) .
An additional query used to match results . This parameter is intended to accept a developer-specified filter for results , if desired .

# Create and configure model-driven app interactive experience dashboards
The interactive experience dashboards come in two forms : multi-stream and single-stream . In addition , multi-stream dashboards can be home page or entity-specific dashboards . The entity-specific dashboards are configured in a different part of the user interface and partially preloaded with the entity-specific configuration information .
Users can apply additional filtering with global filter and timeframe filter . The global filter works at a field level on all charts , and also on streams and tiles that are based on the filter entity ( you specify the filter entity when you configure the visual filters ) .
# # # Multi-stream dashboard standard view
In the multi-stream dashboard , you see a row of visual filters at the top with the data streams below them .
# # # Multi-stream dashboard tile view
The same dashboard , only in the tile view .
For multi-stream dashboards , you can choose from four different layouts .
The entity-specific dashboard for the case entity is shown here .
The single-stream dashboard contains the data stream on the left and visual filters and tiles on the right .
# # Configure filter fields , and security roles for the interactive dashboards
For a field to appear in the global filter and be included in the data stream sort , you must set two flags :
- Appears in global filter in interactive experience
- Sortable in interactive experience dashboard
# # # Configure the &apos; Appears in global filter in interactive experience &apos; option
The global filter flyout window is shown here :
# # # Configure the &apos; Sortable in interactive experience dashboard &apos; option
The fields that you configure for sorting appear in the drop-down list on the stream header .
# # # Enable security roles
Select and enable security roles that will be able to view the interactive dashboards .
# # # # Enable security roles for interactive dashboards
The following sections describe how to create and then configure the various types of interactive dashboards .
# # # Configure a multi-stream interactive dashboard using the 4-column layout
5 . When the dashboard form opens , fill in the filtering information at the top of form , as shown here .
Add the * * Cases By Priority * * doughnut chart .
Some charts , such as bar charts or pie charts , render showing the data stored in the system . The doughnut charts and tag charts load as static images and don ’ t show the preview of the actual data .
The following illustration is an example of a fully configured chart panel and stream panel :
After you have completed configuring the dashboard , save it and publish the customizations for your changes to take effect .
# # # # Edit or delete individual streams of an existing dashboard
An entity-specific dashboard is a multi-stream dashboard . Configuring this dashboard is similar to configuring a home page multi-stream dashboard , but you do it in the different place in the UI and there are other minor differences .
For example , instead of selecting an entity , some fields in the entity-specific dashboard are preset to the entity for which you are creating the dashboard .
The rest of the setup is very similar to the home page multi-stream dashboard setup described in the previous section .

# Address input component ( Preview )
Entering addresses can be frustrating and error-prone , particularly in mobile scenarios .
The address input component lets you see dynamic address suggestions as you type . Using fuzzy matching logic , the component suggests multiple potential address matches that the user can select &amp; mdash ; making it quicker and easier to enter accurate addresses .
# # # Set a default search radius
By default , the component will search around the user &apos;s location ( providing the user has consented for the app to access their location ) . However , you can refine the default search area to help narrow or change initial results when users input an address .
The component will start searching at the latitude and longitude , out to the distance specified in the radius field .
1 . App the map component and the input address component to your app .
This causes the button to save the current latitude and longitude to a collection named * locations * , as long as the search results are not blank
5 . Set the following properties :
Each time a user selects the button , the result from the address input component will be added to the map as a new pin .

# # Options for creating new reports
You can create a new report in one of two ways :
Reports are solution aware . Adding a report as a component to a solution makes it become a single unit of software that extends Power Apps functionality and the user interface . Only reports that are visible to the organization can be added to solutions .
- Unmanaged layer . All imported unmanaged solutions and unmanaged customizations exist at this layer . The unmanaged layer is a single layer .
When you prepare your managed solution for distribution , remember that an environment may have multiple solutions installed or that other solutions may be installed in the future . Construct a solution that follows best practices so that your solution will not interfere with other solutions .
# # View the solution layers for a component
- Lets you see the order in which a solution changed a component .

This section helps you understand the Dynamics 365 Portals release process to prepare for any new release properly and to reduce any impact on your customers . It also talks about various components which are part of your portal .
A portal consists of the following components :
# # Impact of new releases on a Portal solution
As part of any Portal release , Portal website hosts are updated automatically to the latest versions while Portal solutions are updated by customers . It is important to understand the impact of each component update on your live Portal , so you can plan accordingly .
# # # Portal website host update
# # # Portal solution update
# # Get notified about new releases
Notifications are sent around 2-5 business days ahead of the release . Notifications are sent to only those customers whose portals are planned to be updated . Each notification provides details of the type of update and the date / time it will be rolled out along with the link to release notes .
# # Enable a portal for new release
To enable a portal for early upgrade :
If you encounter any issue during the early upgrade phase , you can report it through Microsoft support .

The gallery shows all products except Callisto because the name of that product is the only one that doesn &apos;t contain the letter you specified .
The gallery shows only Europa because only its name contains the letter that you specified in the case that you specified .
The formulas for the picture and name are adjusted to use this name for the current record :
Let &apos;s unpack what is happening here :
# # Self and Parent operators
There are three ways to refer to a control and its properties within a formula :
Use single quotes around a name that contains a space or other special character .
Use two single quotes together to represent one single quote in the name . Names that do not contain special characters do not require single quotes .
Here are some example column names you might encounter in a table , and how they are represented in a formula :
&#124; Column name in a database &#124; Column reference in a formula &#124;
# # Display names and logical names
Since display names are easier to understand , Canvas apps will suggest them as choices and not suggest logical names . Although logical names are not suggested , they can still be used if typed indirectly .
Although it is not suggested , we could also use the logical name for this field . This will result in the same data being retrieved . Note that no single quotes are required since this name does not contain spaces or special characters :

title : Develop offline-capable canvas apps &#124; Microsoft Docs
Mobile users often need to be productive even when they have limited or no connectivity . When you build a canvas app , you can perform these tasks :
- Open Power Apps Mobile and run apps when offline .
The functions also don &apos;t automatically resolve merge conflicts when a device comes online . Configuration on what data is saved and how to handle reconnection is up to the maker when writing expressions .
# # Build an offline app
At a high level , the app performs these tasks :
- When the user opens the app :
- If the device is online , the app fetches data through the Twitter connector and populates a collection with that data .
- Every five minutes while the app is online :
- The app posts any tweets in the local cache .
# # # Step 2 : Collect existing tweets
This formula checks whether the device is online :
- If the device is offline , the formula loads the local cache from a file called &quot; LocalTweets &quot; if it &apos;s available .
1 . Make the text in the last label bold so that the gallery resembles this example .
# # # Step 4 : Show connection status
- If the device is online , it posts the tweet immediately .
Then the formula resets the text in the text-input box .
# # # Step 7 : Check for new tweets
1 . Open the app on a mobile device that &apos;s connected to the Internet .
1 . Disconnect the device from the Internet by enabling the device &apos;s airplane mode and disabling wi-fi .
The status label shows that the app is * * Offline * * .
1 . Reconnect the device to the Internet by disabling the device &apos;s airplane mode and enabling wi-fi .
Within five minutes , the app posts the tweet , which appears in the gallery .
# Define status reason transitions for the Case or custom entities
# # What is the connection between Status and Status Reason fields ?
Entities that can have different status values have two fields that capture this data :
# # Edit status reason transitions
When you edit a status reason field the * * Edit Status Reason Transitions * * button is in the menu .
The screenshot below provides an example that meets the following requirements :
- A case can be merged at any time . You will not be able to merge cases if a status reason transition does not allow for it .
- An active case can be canceled at any time .
- A resolved or canceled case cannot be reactivated .
&gt; This is not a good example for real work , but it demonstrates how stages of status can be enforced through status reason transitions .
# Understand data cards in Power Apps
Let &apos;s walk through an example of how to change a card &apos;s appearance by manipulating controls in it .
3 . Move this control within the card by dragging the selection box , and resize the control by dragging the handles along the edge of the selection box :
You can resize , move , and make other modifications to controls within a card , but you can &apos;t delete it without unlocking it first .
Click or tap the banner at the top to unlock the card so that you can modify these properties :
&gt; You can &apos;t relock a card if you unlock it . To get a card back to a locked state , remove it , and reinsert it in the right-hand pane .
The star is now a part of the card and will travel with it if , for example , you reorder the cards within the form .
# # Interact with a form
After you unlock a card , you can change how it interacts with the form that contains it .
Let &apos;s look at the controls that make up a basic data-entry card . The space between controls has been increased to show each more clearly :
In this graphic , the controls within the data card have been labeled :
Four controls make this card work :
To pull information out of these controls and push it back into the data source , we have the following key formulas :

title : Understand experimental , preview , and experimental features &#124; Microsoft Docs
# Understand experimental , preview , and deprecated features in Power Apps
We take backward compatibility very seriously . However , with any change or improvement , we might introduce an unintended side effect , and your app might not work exactly the way it did before .
To help balance improvement against impact on existing apps , we take larger features through a progression of stages . This article describes this process and how you can control your exposure to features that are under development .
# # Feature roll-out stages
Features move through three stages on their way to becoming official parts of the product :
This table may help you decide when you should jump in :
Where can you find information about these features ? We treat Preview features as finished features , and you can learn more about them just as you do any other product features :
# # Controlling which features are enabled
In some cases , you might need to close and reopen the app after you change a setting . The feature description should indicate when you must perform this step .
Sometimes a feature needs to be retired . Often this occurs when there is a new , better way to accomplish a task . Unpopular features are also pruned too as all features require some overhead to keep up with product changes around them .
Feature deprecation also goes through stages . Features are unique and not every stage will be used by all features .
# Create a Common Data Service starter portal
These are some benefits of creating a portal :
- You can design the portal through the WYSIWYG Power Apps portals Studio by adding and configuring components on the webpages .
You can create a portal either in a new environment or in your existing environment .
To create a portal :
If you have created your portal in the environment that doesn &apos;t have portal pre-requisites installed , the provisioning status is also displayed in the grid :
After the portal is provisioned successfully , the status is updated and the portal is displayed in the grid :
&gt; - Power Apps portals is not available in the France region .
# # # Create additional portals in an environment
In this scenario , the following table explains which additional portal template and language combination is allowed when creating additional portals :
# # Portal provisioning notifications
The following notification is displayed when you select * * Create * * to provision the portal .
* * Notifications in the Notifications pane * *
Notification shown for provisioning successfully completed
If the portal provisioning fails , the notifications are displayed similarly .
Once the provisioning request is successfully placed , a confirmation email notification is sent to the user creating the portal . Also , an email is sent to the user after the portal provisioning is completed .
# # Disable portal creation in a tenant
Administrator are the users having one of the following Azure roles :
Users not having the any of the above mentioned Azure roles are considered as non-administrators .
When the portal creation is disabled in a tenant , non-administrators will see an error as follows :
title : &quot; Add the team entity as a lookup option in your app &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# Add an entity as a lookup option in your app
With Unified Interface apps , for an entity to be available in a lookup it must be added to the app . For example , contact records have the ability to be assigned to a user or a team .
However , if the user entity is included in the app but the team entity is not , only user records will appear in a lookup .
# # Add the team entity to an app
1 . Open the app in the App Designer .

# Manage existing portals in Power Apps
Opens the portal to browse the website . This helps you to see the portal as it will look to your customers .
# # # Share with internal users
To share the portal with internal users you must first create a security role and then assign users to the security role so they can use the portal .
4 . Set the privileges for all the entities used in your portal .
2 . Select the user that you want to assign a security role to .
# # # Share with external users
You must delete the portal configurations manually to completely remove portal configurations from your environment . To do this , use the Portal Management app , and delete the corresponding website record for the portal .
Displays details such as owner of the portal , date and time when it was created and last modified , and the URL of the portal .
# Create web roles for portals
To create a web role :
4 . Enter appropriate values in the fields .
The table below explains the Web Role attributes used by portals .
&#124; Name &#124; The descriptive name of the Web Role &#124;
&#124; Website &#124; The associated website &#124;
&#124; Description &#124; An explanation of the Web Role &apos;s purpose . Optional . &#124;
Now that the Web Role has been created , you will be able to configure it to meet your needs via various permissions , rules , and associations .
The following fields must be set in order to save the entity relationship :
&#124; Required Field &#124; Description &#124;
# # # Entity relationship properties
These properties are about the relationship .
# # # Navigation Pane Item for Primary Entity
From the primary entity you can navigate to see related records . This data is used by model-driven apps to control how the related entity records are displayed . These settings can also be edited using the form editor .
This where you can define standard behaviors for related entities . This information is important because it helps ensure data integrity and can automate business processes for your company .
Let ’ s look at an example .
- Reassign all active tasks .
- Reassign all tasks .
- Reassign none of the tasks .
- Reassign all tasks currently assigned to the former owner of the opportunity .
The relationship can control how actions performed on a record for the primary entity record cascade down to any related entity records .
There are several kinds of behaviors that can be applied when certain actions occur .
These are the behaviors available to be configured .
These are the actions that can trigger certain behaviors :
# # # # Type of Behavior options
Use the * * Type of Behavior * * field to choose between a set of standard behaviors or whether you want to configure them independently .
&#124; Action &#124; Parental &#124; Not Parental &#124;
Any activity entity has a similar set of parental entity relationships for entities that can be associated using the regarding lookup field .
# # # Limitations on behaviors you can set
Because of parental relationships there are some limitations you should keep in mind when you define entity relationships .

# How model-driven app main forms appear on different devices
Any main forms that exist for an entity may be displayed differently depending on the factors in the following table below . When you design a main form , consider how it works in each different presentation .
This diagram represents common components found in updated entity forms .
For updated entities , the layout of the form works with a wide range of displays and window sizes . As the width of window decreases , tab columns move down so that you can scroll down to work with them instead of being compressed or requiring you to scroll to the right .
The following table summarizes available components of the main form for updated entities .
The following items are always visible within the view port in the context of a form :
People can tap the search control to open the screen to search for records .
The form elements displayed are taken from the main form and presented as a series of panels that users see through the view port .
You can show additional tiles based on entity relationships , but you can ’ t customize the tiles for the following entities :
You can customize the remaining tiles with the form editor . The order is fixed , but you can set which elements are visible in the relationship panel .
The remaining panels of the form contain the contents of the tabs in the form . Any subgrids found display as a separate panel .
In addition , entity images are visible in list views and contact cards , but not within the actual form .
&#124; Form Order &#124; Form Name &#124; Security roles &#124;
The following diagram shows the main form components used in the classic presentation .
The forms for updated entities have inherited many components from the classic forms , but there are significant differences .
The form assistant is exposed for certain entities , such as `Article` .
# Sub-grid properties for model-driven app main forms overview
You can configure a sub-grid on a form to display a list of records .
# # Sub-grid properties for model-driven app main forms : Classic
These are the properties available to configure when using a sub-grid component on a form using the classic form designer .
When you select * * All Record Types * * the view will open in a new window .
If the sub-grid displays activities , people will first need to choose the type of activity and then they will see the &quot; add new record &quot; behavior .
Template tags control the output of a template in various ways , and allow the combination of multiple templates into a single output .
Allows user to query data from CDS and render the results in a page .
This attribute contains the result of fetchxml query . You can iterate the result and use it in your webtemplate .
Gets the logical name of the entity .
Gets the structure that contains extra data .
Gets the lowest active row version value .
Gets whether there are more records available .
Gets the current paging information .
Gets the total number of records in the collection . &lt; br / &gt;
ReturnTotalRecordCount was true when the query was executed .
Gets whether the results of the query exceeds the total record count .
When a template is included in another , the included template will have access to any variables defined in the parent template .
It &apos;s also possible to pass any number of named parameters to the include tag . These will then be defined as variables in the included template .
Used in conjunction with the block tag , provides template inheritance . This allows multiple templates to use a shared layout , while overriding specific areas of the parent layout .
When extends is used , it must be the first content in the template , and can only be followed by one or more block tags .
If a block defined in the parent template is not overridden , its contents in the parent template ( if any ) will be rendered .
Allows you to leave un-rendered code inside a Liquid template . Any content within the block will not be rendered , and any Liquid code within will not be executed .
Allows output of Liquid code on a page without having it parsed and executed .
Dates must be in one of these formats :
- DD Mon YYYY
For more information , read :
- Convert date from a string in the French locale and show the result as a long date . In this example , the months and day of the month are interpreted differently from English .
- Convert a date from a string in the user &apos;s locale and calculate the difference between two days , in days
- Convert both a date and time string in the current locale .
- Convert both a date and time string in the French locale . Month and day of the month are interpreted differently .
- Convert both a date and time string in the user &apos;s locale , and display the result with a fractional second .

title : &quot; Create custom help pages &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# Create guided help for your Unified Interface app
&gt; Custom help panes replace the previous learning path guided learning feature used with legacy web client apps .
# # Custom help panes and learning path
Custom help panes provide the following key features that are not available with learning path :
- Free-form rich text , including bullets and numbering .
- Visibly linked coach marks and help balloons .
- More options for video sources , including private sources .
Custom help panes don &apos;t provide the following key features that are available with learning path :
- Sequential help balloons .
- Help pages for per-device form factor , such as smartphones .
To author custom help panes , you need the following :
- Version 9.1.0.10300 or later .
# # Enable custom help panes for your environment
Each help pane is unique for these contexts :
# # Help pane navigation
By default , a help pane stays open and on the help content you first opened it with even when you navigate to a different form . This allows for the help content to remain intact as you direct users to different parts of the app .
# # # To author help pane content
The help pane is now in edit mode and the cursor is positioned on the help pane title .
3 . From the edit pane you can perform the following tasks :
- Enter text by typing directly in the help pane area .
# # # Bullets and numbered lists
Selecting the bullet or number icon toggles the current line to become bulleted or numbered . If you have selected multiple lines in a list , each line becomes bulleted or numbered . Tabbing and indenting subnumbers a line within the list .
A section is a collapsible text box . You can put links or free-form text in it . Use a section to group similar items . A section can be either open or collapsed by default .
# # # Video and static images
&gt; Remember to copy the link URL for the video or image you want so you can paste it into your help pane .
Custom help panes support the following video sources :
# # # Balloons and coach marks
1 . Link to first UI element with instructions or comments .
2 . Link to second UI element with instructions or comments .
3 . Link to third UI element with instructions or comments .
A user can either select an element in order or go back to a specific one and highlight it .
# # Solutions and custom help pane content
# # # Moving content via solutions
By default , all new help pages appear in the default solution . If you want to move your content to another environment , first add your existing help pages into an unmanaged solution before you export them . To add a help page to an unmanaged solution , follow these steps :
1 . Navigate to your unmanaged solution .
&gt; Currently , you can &apos;t add existing help panes to an unmanaged solution in the modern solution explorer .
# # Help page documentation automation
When exported , each help page is exported as a separate file .
This section discusses frequently asked questions about custom help pages .
# # # Are custom help pages the same as customizable help ?
# # # How do I migrate my data from learning path to custom help pages ?
Learning path has two types of help : help panes and sequential help balloons . The sequential help balloon locations are deeply integrated with the legacy web client UI and are not transferrable to the new custom help panes .
# # Custom help XML definition
This section describes the custom help XML definition .
# # # # Definition and usage

# Mod function in Power Apps
Returns the remainder of a division .
The result has the same sign as the divisor .
# SetFocus function in Power Apps
Moves input focus to a specific control .
- a newly exposed or enabled input control , to guide the user in what comes next and for faster data entry .
- a form is validated , to focus and display the offending input control for quick resolution .
# # # Focus on a newly exposed or enabled input control
To create this example :
# # # Focus on validation issues
When validating a form , it can be helpful to not only display a message if there is a problem but to also take the user to the field that is offending . It can be particularly helpful if the field in question is scrolled off the screen and not visible .
# # # Focus when displaying a screen
Similar to exposing an input control , when displaying a data entry screen it is helpful to focus the first input control for faster data entry .
1 . Create the &quot; Focus on validation issues &quot; app above .
1 . Add a second screen .
# Launch and Param functions in Power Apps
Launches a webpage or a canvas app and provides access to launch parameters .
Launches a webpage or a canvas app . The function supports :
Webpages are launched via a URL address . For example :
- An argument list of name value pairs . For example :
- A record of field values . For example :
This form can be easier to work with as it makes the association between name and value clearer . It &apos;s the only form that supports the optional * LaunchTarget * argument .
- Param names are case-sensitive .
- Param names and values will be automatically URL decoded for use in your app .
Update the app ID , screen name , and record number as appropriate .
Update the app ID , tenant ID , screen name , and record number as appropriate .
# # # # Example - Launch
1 . Move the label to the bottom right of the screen .
1 . Save and publish the app .
# # # # Example - Param
1 . When your app launches , the label shows the parameter value passed .
1 . Close the app player and edit the app .
You &apos;ll also add a scroll bar so that users who don &apos;t have touch screens or mouse wheels can browse the entire gallery .
&gt; * Change the layout of the gallery
&gt; * Change the type of data that appears in the gallery
&gt; * Change the columns by which users can sort and search the data
&gt; * Change the screen title
&gt; * Show a scroll bar
When the gallery is selected , a selection box with handles surrounds it .
The gallery shows the name of each account .
# # Change sort and search columns
1 . Select the gallery as the previous section describes .
The value of this property appears in the formula bar . You set this property to specify not only the data source for the gallery but also the columns by which users can sort and search the data .
1 . Copy this formula , and then paste it in the formula bar .
By using this formula , you ensure that :
* If a user types one or more characters in the search bar , the gallery shows only those account names that contain the text that the user typed .
* If a user selects the sort icon , the gallery is sorted alphabetically by account name in either ascending or descending order , depending on how many times the user selects the icon .
# # # Test sorting and searching
1 . Near the upper-right corner of the browse screen , select the sort icon one or more times to change the alphabetical sort order between ascending and descending .
The screen reflects your change .
If your users might have neither touch screens nor mouse wheels , configure the gallery to show a scrollbar when the user hovers over it with the mouse . That way , users can show all accounts even if the screen can &apos;t show them all at once .
1 . Select the gallery as the first procedure describes .
# Connect to SharePoint from a canvas app

title : &quot; Global search in Power Apps portals &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
In Power Apps portals , you can search for records across multiple entities by using portal &apos;s global search functionality . You can also search within records of entity lists using entity list search functionality .
Entity list search functionality in the portal uses FetchXML in the backend to search the columns defined in the entity list and then display the results .
Global search uses an external search index that is based on Lucene.Net and is used to search within multiple entities and fields at once .
Global search of portals allows you to search for records across multiple entities . It also allows you to search across multiple columns and configure what columns of an entity would be searchable .
- Find matches to any word in the search term in any field in the entity . Matches can include inflectional words like stream , streaming , or streamed .
- Return results from all searchable entities in a single list sorted by relevance , based on factors such as :
- Number of words matched .
- Proximity to each other in the text .
- Highlight matches in the search results .
- Provide facet options that can be used to further filter search results .
The following sections detail how global search works in Power Apps portals and describe the various configuration options available .
# # Entities searchable in portal global search
- Articles are searchable only if they are published and their Internal Only field is set to false .
# # Fields searchable in global search
All the fields available in the view defined by the Search / IndexQueryName site setting for any entity are indexed in global search and are searchable .
If the view is not available for any entity , it &apos;s not indexed and the results are not displayed in global search .
The following site settings are related to global search :
The following content snippets are related to global search :
# # Special characters and syntax supported by search
As part of portal global search , a variety of special characters and syntaxes are supported to filter search results better . These special characters and syntaxes are broadly divided into the following groups :
Each search query can consist of one or many of these terms of any type that are combined using Boolean operators to create complex queries .
&gt; - You cannot use a * or ? symbol as the first character of a search .
&gt; Boolean operators must be written in uppercase .
Search index updates in Power Apps portals happen automatically like the cache invalidation . Keep these important things in mind , though :
- All search-enabled entities must have the Change Notification metadata flag enabled , otherwise the portal will not be notified of the changes and the search index will not be updated .
Rebuild of full search index is required whenever :
- You make a metadata change to search properties like changing certain query-specific site settings or changing the search view of an entity , and so on .
- Bulk data migration or updates are performed .
You can also rebuild a full search index from a portal .
&gt; A full index rebuild is a very expensive operation and should not be done during peak hours of usage , as this can bring your portal down .
# # Remove an entity from global search
At times , you might be required to completely remove certain entities from portal global search to ensure that your customers get the right results quickly .
In the following example , we will remove the Case entity from portal global search .
# # # Step 1 : Block case entity from getting indexed
To block the Case entity from getting indexed , you must rename the view of the Case entity that defines the record set to be indexed by the portal ( defined by the Search / IndexQueryName site setting ) . By default , the name of that view is Portal Search .
1 . Save and publish the changes and close the view editor .
&gt; In this example , we are making changes in an unmanaged layer by directly editing the view . You can also do this via a managed solution .
# # # Step 2 : Remove case entity from the UI
The modified value will be :
Once this site setting is changed , the Case entity will be removed from filters on the search page as well as in the header .
&gt; The maximum file upload size is 125 MB .
2 . Navigate to your storage account .
You must add cross-origin resource sharing ( CORS ) rule on your Azure Storage account as follows , otherwise you will see the regular attachment icon rather than the cloud icon :
CORS rule example :
# Open the model-driven app form editor
# # Access the form editor from the Power Apps site
# # Access the form editor from solution explorer
3 . In the list of forms , click the form you want to edit .
# # Access the form editor through the command bar within a model-driven app
1 . Open a record .
# # Access the form editor from within app
You can access the form editor through the command bar or the ribbon , depending on the entity . Both of these methods will open the form in the context of the default solution .
# # Access the form editor for an unmanaged solution
2 . Select the unmanaged solution you want to work with .
# # # Add an entity to an unmanaged solution
6 . In the list of forms , double-click the form you want to edit .

# # Change the sort order of a view
3 . Select a view to open it in the view designer .
You can also change the sort order by using the view properties panel .
You may want to sort by more than one column when you have data that you want to group by the same value in one column , and then sort another column within that group of equal values .
2 . Select the conditional operator that you want to use .
3 . Type or select the comparison value for the condition .
The filter expressions for a view are shown in the View properties panel .
5 . To edit a filter expression , select the filter select expression from the View properties panel .

# Configure model-driven app form event handlers
Form event handlers for Power Apps forms can be configured for the following areas in a form :
An event handler consists of a reference to a JavaScript web resource and a function defined within that web resource that will execute when the event occurs . Each element can have up to 50 separate event handlers configured .
&gt; Do not configure a script event handler using a library that does not come from a source you trust . Scripts can be used to perform any action a user might perform and a poorly written script can significantly damage the performance of a form .
&gt; After you configure an event handler always test it to verify it is working correctly .
# # # To configure an event handler
1 . In the form editor , select the element with the event you want to configure a handler for .
5 . To add a form library to an event handler :
3 . To create a JavaScript web resource :
1 . In the web resource form set the following properties :
&#124; Description &#124; Optional . Type a description of the web resource . &#124;
12 . When the event handler is entered you may adjust the order in which the function will be executed relative to any other functions by using the green arrows to move it up or down .

&gt; If the portal is currently being provisioned or the package install is not finished in the organization , an error is displayed if you try to download the public key . You must wait until portal provisioning is complete and the portal is up and running .
title : Create a chart in a canvas app &#124; Microsoft Docs
Use line charts , pie charts , and bar charts to display your data in a canvas app . When you work with charts , the data that you import should be structured based on these criteria :
* Labels should be in the leftmost column .
For example , your data should look similar to the following :
You can create and use these charts within Power Apps . Let &apos;s get started .
# # Import the sample data
The ProductRevenue collection is listed with the chart data you imported :
6 . Press Esc to return to the default workspace .
# # Add a pie chart
3 . In the pie-chart control , select the middle of the pie chart :
The pie chart shows the revenue data from 2014 .
# # Add a bar chart to display your data
Now , let &apos;s use this ProductRevenue collection in a bar chart :
The column chart shows the revenue data from 2012 :
4 . In the column chart , select the center square :
The column chart shows revenue data for each product over three years :
Specifies a value with a string data type that may be passed as a parameter .

# Relate and Unrelate functions in Power Apps
Relate and unrelate records of two entities through a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship .
These functions never create or delete a record . They only relate or unrelate two records that already exist .
&#124; Relationship display name &#124; Related entity &#124; Relationship type &#124;
To remove the relationship between these records :
At no time did we create or remove or a record , only the relationship between records was modified .
As Many-to-Many relationships are symmetric , we could also have done this in the opposite direction :
You &apos;ll first create a simple app to view and reassign the reservations that are associated with a product .
The Products entity is part of the sample data loaded above .
1 . Press F5 to test the app in Preview mode .
A delegation warning appears , but it won &apos;t matter with the small amount of data in this example .
The sample data doesn &apos;t include a many-to-many relationship , but you &apos;ll create one between the Products entity and the Contacts entity . Users can relate each product to more than one contact and each contact to more than one product .
1 . Change the entity filter to include all entities .
By default , sample entities don &apos;t appear .
# # # # Relate and unrelate contacts with one or more products
You &apos;ll create another app that resembles the one you created earlier in this topic , but the new app will offer a many-to-many relationship . Each contact will be able to reserve multiple products instead of only one .
No text will appear in that control until you finish this procedure and assign a contact to a product .
With this app , users can now freely relate and unrelate a set of contacts to each product .
Unlike one-to-many , a many-to-many relationship allows users to associate the same contact with multiple products .
Many-to-many relationships are symmetric . You can extend the example to add products to a contact and then flip between the two screens to show how the relationship appears from either direction .
The result will look very similar to the previous screen but comes at the relationship from the * * Contacts * * side .
With this new screen , users can add a contact to a product and then flip to a view of contacts and see the associated product . The relationships are symmetric and shared between the two screens .

title : Create a relationship between entities by using a lookup field &#124; Microsoft Docs
# Create a relationship between entities
Additionally , you can set advanced cascading behaviors on many-to-one and one-to-many relationships whenever an action is taken on the parent entity .
# # Add a One-to-many relationship
# # Add a Many-to-many relationship
# # Add advanced relationship behavior
While building a one-to-many or a many-to-one relationship , you can also set advanced behaviors .
These options are also referred to as cascading behaviors because they cascade down the hierarchy of related entities . For example , it may be desirable to delete the related tests and homework of a student if a student is removed from the system . This type of behavior is called a parental relationship .

3 . Click or tap one of the buttons to navigate to another screen .
# # Step 4 : Build the AssignManager screen
In this step , we &apos;ll use a gallery to display all projects that have been approved but don &apos;t yet have a manager . We &apos;ll add other controls , so you can assign a manager .
1 . Save the changes you &apos;ve made so far .
2 . Add a label with the following properties :
# # # Add a back arrow to return to the SelectTask screen
1 . Click or tap the blue bar at the top of the screen .
3 . Move the arrow to the left side of the blue bar , and set the following properties :
# # # Add and modify a gallery
The gallery now has the right layout , but it still has the default sample text . We &apos;ll fix that next .
3 . Set the following properties for the gallery :
4 . In the right pane , update the fields to match the following list :
The screen should now look like the following image .
# # # Change the color of an item if it &apos;s selected
2 . Select an item in the gallery . The screen should now look like the following image .
The completed screen should now look like the following image .
# # Step 5 : Build the ViewProjects screen
The gallery now has the right layout , with the default sample text .
2 . Select the back arrow you added there , and copy it .
# # # Change the data source for the BrowseGallery1 gallery
3 . In the right pane , update the fields to match the following list :

# Pass a list of related records as data context to an embedded canvas app
This topic explains how to add an embedded canvas app and pass a list of records related to the current ( main form ) record as a data context to the embedded canvas app .
Let &apos;s say you want to add an embedded canvas app on an account main form and pass a list of contacts related to the current account record to the embedded canvas app . To do this , follow these steps :
- Even though this property appears changeable , changing it has no effect on the embedded canvas app . It is meant only to serve as a reference for you .
- Notice that any change to the App ID value breaks the link from the model-driven form to the embedded canvas app .
- The form editor has been listening for the App ID to be sent to it .
- The App ID was sent to it when the app was saved .

If this setting is off , the app adjusts to the aspect ratio of the device on which it &apos;s running ( and distorting the UI if necessary ) .
In an environment , the reporting infrastructure is shared and separate from the database . In this architecture , although customers share the resources required to run the report , each report runs against the customers ’ individual database instances . Additionally , users can run as many reports as they need whenever they want to run them to meet business goals . We do not place time restrictions on reports .
Typically , for most organizations &apos; reporting needs , these settings are adequate . To make sure that your users do not exceed these settings and to improve report querying performance in general , consider the following best practices .
- We recommend that you limit the number of entities that are needed to return the result . This helps reduce the time required to run the query and return the result set .
- We recommend that you reduce the number of records shown in detailed reports . Suitable filtering can be used to reduce the number of records returned by the query to reduce timeouts .
&gt; When you use these tools , we recommend you move or synchronize data during nonbusiness hours .

# # Edit a quick view form
When you edit a quick view form , you must publish your changes before they will be visible in the application .
# # Add a quick view control to a main form
Quick view forms can only be added to a main form where a lookup field exists that targets the entity of the quick view form .

# Define web form steps for portals
The Web Form Step provides the flow logic of the form &apos;s user experience such as steps and conditional branching . It also provided details regarding the rendering of a form and additional behavior .
&#124; Name &#124; A title used for reference . &#124;
&#124; Web Form &#124; The Web Form associated with the current step . &#124;
&#124; Target Entity Logical Name &#124; The logical name of the entity associated with the form . &#124;
# Maintenance mode for a portal
There might be times when your website is under scheduled maintenance or is down due to temporary outage . When a customer accesses the website during maintenance , unpredictable behavior and intermittent unavailability might be experienced .
You can enable maintenance mode on your portal to provide a consistent message , instead of dealing with unpredictable behavior when your website is under scheduled maintenance . This will provide a better experience for your portal users .
# # Configure or disable maintenance mode
After enabling maintenance mode for your portal , you can update the maintenance mode settings and choose a different page .
# Build global support into canvas apps
Power Apps is a global product . You can build and use canvas apps in many different languages and regions .
When using the web experiences , the language used is provided by the browser . Most browser default to the host operating system &apos;s setting with some also providing a way to set the language manually .
The authoring environment adapts to the language setting of the author . The app itself is stored in a language agnostic manner , so that authors using different languages can edit the same app .
# # # Names in formulas
Most elements in formula are always in English :
As the authoring experience is localized , control and other object names will appear in the native language of the author . In Spanish , some of the control names appear as :
You can use whatever names you like for :
* Context variable names
# # # Formula separators and chaining operator
The change in the Power Apps list separator is consistent with what happens to the Excel list separator . It impacts :
* Arguments in function calls .
For example , consider the following formula expressed in a language and region that uses dot or period as the decimal separator , such as Japan or the United Kingdom :
Now view this same formula in a language and region where a comma is used for the decimal separator , such as France or Spain :
The app you create can adapt to different languages , providing a great user experience for your users around the world .
And then use a formula such as the following to pull translated strings from the table :
# # # Formatting numbers , dates , and times
# # # Reading numbers , dates , and times
There are four functions for reading numbers , dates , and times provided by the user :
# # # Calendar and Clock information
title : &quot; Preview : Use environment variables in solutions &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# Preview : Environment variables overview
Benefits of using environment variables :
- No need to manually edit configurable values in a production environment .
- Configure one or more variables in one place and reference like a parameter across multiple solution components .
- Update values without a code change .
- Service the definitions and the values independently or together .
- Can be used to control feature flags and other application settings .
# # How do they work ?
# # # Create an environment variable in Power Apps
Separation of default value and current value allows you to service the definition and the default value separately from the current value . It also allows us to extend the functionality in the future to support multiple values scoped to a specific run time context .
&gt; A value can &apos;t exist without a definition . The interface only allows creation of one value per definition .
A notification is displayed when the environment variables do not have any values . This is a reminder to set the values so that components dependent on variables do not fail . It also allows partners to ship variables without values and the customer is prompted to input the values .
&gt; We recommend partners build their own interfaces requiring the customers to provide the values . Notifications help prevent failures if this step is skipped .
- Caching . Plugins will need to run a query to fetch the values .
- Data types are validated in the modern solution interface only , but not currently on the server during the preview .
- Dependencies are not enforced for certain component types .
- If using Excel to import environment variables , be sure to pre-pend the publisher prefix to the SchemaName .
# Define web form properties for portals
The web form contains relationships to webpages and a start step to control the initialization of the form within the portal . The relationship to the webpage allows dynamic retrieval of the form definition for a given page node within the website .
The other options on the web form record itself control top-level preferences for the multiple-step process as a whole , for example whether you &apos;d like to display a progress bar .
The following attributes and relationships determine the functionality of the Web form .
&#124; Name &#124; A title of the form used for reference . &#124;
&#124; Prepend Step Number to Step Title &#124; Check to add the number of the step to the beginning of the title of the step . Default is unchecked . &#124;
Example of the various progress indicator types :
* * Title with Step Number prepended * *
# # “ Save changes ” warning
&gt; Firefox does not provide the ability to specify a custom message .
# # Geolocation configuration for web form
&gt; The Geolocation section is not visible in the German Sovereign Cloud environment . If a user has enabled geolocation by using a different form , it will not be displayed during rendering on portal .

# How to work with permissions in a lookup list from SharePoint site ?
The example in this tutorial explains how you can work with a canvas app that connects to SharePoint with such broken inheritance .
1 . Create two SharePoint lists with one list consuming columns as lookups from the other list . In this tutorial , we &apos;d use two lists :
&#124; List &#124; Columns
Shapes list has a Color lookup column . This lookup column is connected to the Color column from the Colors list for values . You can also use your own lists instead .
1 . If necessary , create sample items :
&#124; Circle &#124; Red
&#124; Rectangle &#124; Blue
The shape colors are through lookup column from the Colors list .
Since the SharePoint site , list or items aren &apos;t shared with the user , the app will show no available items .
1 . Grant the user item-level permission to a SharePoint list item .

# Overview of the email-screen template for canvas apps
&gt; * How to use the default email screen .
To add an email screen from the template :
* To search for users in your org , start typing their name in the text input box below &quot; To &quot; .
* You must add at least one person as a recipient and provide a subject to send an email .
* After you send the email , the contents of the subject line and message body , as well as the recipient list will all be erased .
This allows users to send a single image with their email as an attachment .
This formula checks for an uploaded image . If there is none , then it uses the same `Office365.SendEmail` operation as before . If there is an image , it is added as an attachment in the Attachments table .
&gt; To add more than one attachment to an email , add records to the Attachments table .

title : Create an order gallery in a canvas app &#124; Microsoft Docs
# Create an order gallery in a canvas app
# # Create a blank app
Power Apps Studio opens so that you can add data sources and controls to your app :
The * * Orders * * entity contains many fields of various types :
The control will be placed on the canvas and a fly out dialog will appear asking which data source to connect to .
# # Show each order &apos;s status
In this procedure , you &apos;ll add space in the gallery for a label and configure it to show each order &apos;s status in a different color based on the data .
With this formula in place , different status values appear in different colors , as the previous graphic shows .
# # Display each order &apos;s total
1 . Select the first item in the gallery , which is the gallery &apos;s template :
1 . Move the new label so that it appears under the status label :
1 . Move the gallery to the left edge of the screen , and decrease the gallery &apos;s width to close up some space .
To recap , you started to build a single-screen canvas app by adding the order gallery , which includes these elements :
- A field in a many-to-one relationship : `ThisItem.Customer.Company`

# Choose and configure columns in model-driven app views
Along with the filter criteria , the columns visible in a Power Apps view are very important to the value provided by the view . In this topic , you create or edit views by performing the following tasks :
# # # Open the view editor
You can include columns from the current entity or any of the related entities that have a 1 : N entity relationship with the current entity .
# # # # Add columns to views
2 . Select the fields you want to add to the view designer . This adds the field as a column on the right-hand of the view .
As you add columns , you will increase the width of the view . If the width of the view exceeds the space available to show it in the page , horizontal scrollbars will allow people to scroll and see the hidden columns .
&gt; When you add columns to Lookup views for updated entities , only the first three columns will be displayed .
# # # Change column width
1 . Hover over the area between columns in the view .
2 . A line appears and your cursor becomes a double sided arrow .
3 . Drag the column to the appropriate width .

# Create or edit model-driven app web resources to extend an app
Web resources are typically used by developers to extend an app using files that are used in web development . App users may need to manage web resources provided by a developer or designer .
# # What are web resources ?
Because web resources are data in the system and are solution aware , you can move them to different organizations by exporting them as part of a solution and importing the solution into a different organization . You must use solution explorer to work with web resources .

# Transfer data from Hospital to Regional System
Microsoft provides you the following solutions for emergency response :
Hospital Emergency Response solution customers can transfer their hospital data to the regional medical organizations that have Regional Government Emergency Response and Monitoring solution .
This article provides information about how to use SFTP to do the data transfer .
# # How does the data transfer happen ?
This is how the data transfer happens :
These are the prerequisites for the data transfer to work successfully .
# # Configure your solutions for data transfer
IT admins need to perform some steps to configure the data transfer from Hospital Emergency Response solution to SFTP server and from SFTP server to Regional Government Emergency Response and Monitoring solution .
This step is required for both hospital and regional solutions .
&gt; Make sure that you create connections in your Power Apps environment before installing the hospital and regional emergency response solutions or upgrading to the latest version . This will save you a lot of steps later while enabling flows that get installed as part of these solutions .
1 . From the top-right corner , select your hospital or regional environment .
This step has to be performed by the admins of the Hospital Emergency Response solution after they have installed the solution .
In this step , we will enable the following flows that will publish reviewed data from the hospital solution to SFTP server on a set schedule and on-demand :
- Publish Bed Census Data
- Publish COVID Data
- Publish Data for All Facilities
- Publish Equipment Needs Data
- Publish Staff Updates
- Publish Supply Item Details
- Update Sync Census
- Update Sync Equipment Needs
To enable these flows :
1 . Repeat steps 4-6 for other flows listed earlier .
1 . Specify the data publish recurrence schedule .
This step has to be performed by the admins of the Regional Government Emergency Response and Monitoring solution .
1 . Verify the embedded connections for this flow . These should be the same connections that you created earlier .
# # Review and publish data to SFTP
The record &apos;s review status changes to * * Completed * * .
# # # Manually publish data
The scheduled flow publishes data at a certain time , but what if you want to manually or immediately publish the data after reviewing it .
# Reset function in Power Apps
Resets a control to its default value , discarding any user changes .
Input controls are also reset when their * * Default * * property changes .
2 . Type a new value in the text box .
5 . Select the button . This can be done even when authoring by selecting toward the ends of the control .
# Control webpage access for portals
Web page access control rules are rules that you create for your site to control both the publishing actions that a web role can perform across the pages of your website and to control which pages are visible by which web roles . The webpage access entity has the following attributes :
&#124; Name &#124; A descriptive name for the rule . &#124;
&#124; Website &#124; The website that this rule applies to ; must match the website of the page to which this rule is applied . Filters Web Page . &#124;
After creating a new access control rule , associate it with a page . This will cause it to affect both the page you assign the rule to and all child pages &amp; mdash ; in other words , the entire branch of the website .
There are two types of access control rules : Grant Change and Restrict Read .
Next , you would set the right to grant change and the webpage to the parent page of the entire news branch of your site . You would then assign this web role to any contacts you want to designate as news editors . Note that one user can have many web roles .
You would then set the right to restrict read and the page to the page at the top of the branch which is to be read only by employees . You would then associate this rule with the employee web role and then assign users to this role .

You can expect that managers and decisions makers will want forms that are optimized to provide quick reference to key data points . They will like to see charts more than lists and they may not perform a lot of data entry .
People who interact directly with customers may need forms tailored to tasks they perform most frequently . They may want forms that allow for the most efficient data entry .
You ’ ll have to balance this with the amount of time you want to spend managing forms . Creating and editing forms is relatively easy , but as you create more forms , you have to manage more forms .

Let &apos;s learn more about each of these .
Canvas apps give you the flexibility to arrange the user experience and interface the way you want it . Allow your creativity and business sense to guide how you want your apps to look and feel .
You can start to build your app from Microsoft tools where your data lives , such as :
Creating a canvas app is easy ; with Power Apps , you can find or create your app in several ways :
Getting started with model-driven apps is simple , and you can begin with these topics :

- If the app is running in a browser :
- Closing the browser or the browser tab in which the app is running .
- Selecting the browser &apos;s back button .
- Selecting the back button on an Android device .
The exact look of the confirmation dialog box might vary across devices and versions of Power Apps .
The confirmation dialog box doesn &apos;t appear in Power Apps Studio .
In a browser , the confirmation dialog box might appear with a generic message from the browser .
This dialog box appears if the user changes data in either form and then tries to close the app without saving those changes .

# Understand data-form layout for canvas apps in Power Apps
In this tutorial , we &apos;ll walk through the steps to create this form . We &apos;ll also look at some advanced topics , such as dynamic sizing of fields to fill available space .
1 . Create a tablet app from scratch , and add your data source .
Everything discussed in this article also applies to phone layouts , but phone apps often have only one vertical column .
This record will appear in the form that you build by following steps later in this article .
1 . Add a blank screen where you &apos;ll put the form .
The label shows the sales-order number of the record that you selected in the gallery .
3 . ( optional ) Format the label as follows :
The form shows the record that you selected in the gallery , but the default set of fields might not match what you want in your final product .
4 . In the right-hand pane , hide each of these fields by clearing its checkbox :
# # Select a data card
You can also select cards directly on the form . When a card is selected , a black caption appears above it .
# # Arrange cards in columns
By default , forms in tablet apps have three columns , and in phone apps have one . You can specify not only how many columns a form has but also whether all cards should fit within column borders .
The form doesn &apos;t visibly change , but you have more snap points as you drag the left or right grab handle .
5 . Make the first two lines of the delivery address stretch entirely across the form :
All done . We have our desired form , mixing rows with different numbers of columns :
# # Manipulate controls in a card
The delivery address includes several pieces of information that we want to visually group together for the user . Each field will remain in its own data card , but we can manipulate the controls within the card to make them fit better together .
3 . In the same card , move the text input box over the label to reduce the space between the first and second lines of the address .
The height of the card shrinks when its contents take up less space .
The result for the complete third address line :
# # Turning off Snap to columns
After careful positioning , the result has appropriate sizes for each field and even spacing horizontally between fields :
In summary , what are the differences when * * Snap to columns * * is on versus off ?
&#124; Behavior &#124; Snap to columns On &#124; Snap to columns Off &#124;
# # Set width and height
# # # Filling spaces : WidthFit
You can &apos;t turn off this behavior , so changing the heights of cards can be challenging . All cards within a row appear to be the same height as the tallest card . You might look at a row like this :
title : &quot; View the profile card for a contact or user &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# View the profile card for a contact or user
# # View a contact &apos;s profile
2 . Select an existing activity or create a new one .
You can view details of the contact inline which includes the contact picture , name , title and account .
# # View a user &apos;s profile
2 . Select an account record .
3 . Hover over the owner field when it has a user record . You can view the details of the user inline .
Profile cards can be seen on contact and user records . You can only view them when they are in a lookup .
# # # Where is information shown in the profile card coming from ?
# # # How can I customize the fields shown on the profile card ?
Currently , the list of fields displayed on the profile card are not open for customization .
title : Create a canvas app from a SharePoint list &#124; Microsoft Docs
# Create a canvas app in Power Apps from a SharePoint list
The app that you create will contain three screens :
- In the browse screen , you can scroll through all items in the list .
- In the details screen , you can show all information about a single item in the list .
- In the edit screen , you can create an item or update information about an existing item .
You can apply the concepts and techniques in this topic to any list in SharePoint . To follow the steps exactly :
# # Create an app from within SharePoint Online
# Configure Open ID Connect provider settings for portals
Examples of authority URLs are :
The left portion of the URL is the * * Authority * * value and is in one of the following formats :
Apply portal site settings referencing the above application .
&gt; The Client ID and the authority URL do not contain the same value and should be retrieved separately .
title : &quot; Create or edit model-driven app dashboards &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# Create or edit model-driven app dashboards
# # Create a new standard dashboard
5 . Select one of the component areas and then select the icon for a chart or a list .
You can have up to six components in the dashboard .
# # Edit an existing dashboard
Additional system dashboards tasks you can perform include :
- Remove a list or chart from a dashboard
- Add a list or chart to a dashboard
- Set the default dashboard
- Use security roles to make a dashboard visible to just certain roles
# Optimize model-driven app form performance
Think about the interaction the user will have with the form and the amount of data that must be displayed within it .
The more fields you have in a form , the more data that needs to be transferred over the Internet or intranet to view each record .
When you have customizations using form scripts make sure that the developer understands these strategies to improve performance .
* * Avoid using synchronous requests * *
* * Avoid including unnecessary JavaScript web resource libraries * *
The more scripts you add to the form , the more time it will take to download them . Usually scripts are cached in your browser after they are loaded the first time , but the performance the first time a form is viewed often creates a significant impression .
* * Avoid loading all scripts in the Onload event * *
* * Use collapsed tabs to defer loading web resources * *
* * Set default visibility options * *
# # Command bar or ribbon
Keep these recommendations in mind as you edit the command bar or ribbon .
* * Keep the number of controls to a minimum * *
Within the command bar or the ribbon for the form , evaluate what controls are necessary and hide any that you don ’ t need . Every control that is displayed increases resources that need to be downloaded to the browser .
* * Use asynchronous network requests in Custom Rules * *

# Common Data Service and the improved data source experience
# # How do I upgrade ?
Upgrade your app by inspecting the settings of the features and then by following the directions below :
1 . Wait for the health monitor to finish analyzing your app .
1 . Save , close , and reopen your app .
1 . Resolve all formula errors .
* Possible errors and suggestions * :
For any field and entity display name conflict , you may see a formula that expects an entity but resolves to a locally scoped field name .
1 . Remove your existing Common Data Service data source connections .
1 . Add the Common Data Service connection using the new data source selection experience .
&gt; If your application is extremely large , adding your data source connections back may take a while . Don &apos;t close the application during this process .
# # Converting canvas apps with the Dynamics 365 connector
To convert your app that uses the Dynamics 365 connector , you &apos;ll need to remove and add the connections to your data sources . Use the steps below to convert your connections to your data sources .
2 . Remove your existing Dynamics 365 data source connections .
&gt; - You need to meet one of the following requirements to be able to see an environment that you want to add the connection to :
It ’ s possible to have errors as you convert if : you aren &apos;t using Display Names , if you are using GUID strings , or if you are using an option set field .
- If control name conflicts , change the name of the control to be different and unique .
- For any Polymorphic references , refer to the Detailed Examples section below .
# # # # Removing and adding Option set Data cards
# # # # Editing the Option Set Filter expressions to use new syntax
Previously , if you wanted to use an Option Set value in a Filter expression you would need to use the * Value * field . For example :
You &apos;ll need to edit this formula . Option set text identifer is no longer used for the value . This expression should be updated to look the following :
Following is an example of earlier Patch statement for Option Set :
You &apos;ll need to update your statements to follow this form :
# # # # Option Set disambiguation
# # # # Removing and adding Two Option set Data cards
You should remove existing data cards and add them back to work with your Two Option set . The data types were earlier recognized as simple boolean - such as true / on and false / off with no labels :
If you prefer the toggle switch for your boolean field , you can unlock the data card and replace the control in the data card with a toggle instead . You &apos;ll also need to set these properties on the Toggle .
# # # # Refining Two Option Patch statements
For instance , the Owner field in an entity can refer to a record in the Users entity or the Teams entity . The same lookup field in different records could refer to records in different entities .
# # # # # Polymorphic with Filter and Patch
Record references can be used just like a full record :
To fix this issue :
1 . Add the data sources for the entity types that Owner could be ; in current example , Users and Teams ) .
2 . Use additional functions to make your intent clear .
There are two new functions you can make use of :
- IsType – Checks if a record reference is of a particular entity type .
- AsType – Casts a record reference to a particular entity type .
With these functions , you can write a formula that displays the name of the Owner taken from two differently named fields , based on the entity type of the Owner :
The following example shows that as you select an Account , all the Activities associated with that account will be displayed :
# # # # # Filtering
# Card control in Power Apps
* Allows a single card to be used in both edit and view forms , by configuring this property , which is tied to the Form &apos;s behavior by default .
If you delete a lookup field , the 1 : N entity relationship for it will automatically be deleted .
# Add geospatial components to your app ( Preview )
You can add a number of geospatial components to your canvas app to support scenarios that involve mapping locations and addresses .
The following prebuilt components can be used for geospatial and mapping scenarios :
# # # Enable the geospatial features for the environment
Before you can use geospatial features in your apps , an admin must enable access to the features for the environment where you want to create your app .
The geospatial features require additional terms of use that must be reviewed and agreed to .
&gt; You must read and agree to the terms of service before you can use geospatial features . The following are the terms of service :
&gt; Additional licensing requirements might be required to enable this feature .
# # # Enable the geospatial features for each app

# Get started with canvas-app formulas in Power Apps
* In Excel , you build formulas that , for example , populate cells and create tables and charts .
* In Power Apps , you build similar formulas as you configure controls instead of cells . In addition , you build formulas that apply specifically to apps instead of spreadsheets .
# # Show a simple value
The formula bar sits at the top of the screen .
This bar has two parts :
You can change the name of the selected control in the * * Content * * tab by clicking the name .
# # Change a value based on input
# # Change a color based on user input
5 . Adjust the sliders , and see how your changes affect the background color .
# # View a list of properties by category

As you type a formula in the formula bar , different syntax elements appear in different colors to improve readability and help you understand long formulas . Here is the color code list in Power Apps .
title : Understand variables in canvas apps &#124; Microsoft Docs
In general , avoid using variables . But sometimes only a variable can enable the experience you want . Variables are implicitly created and typed when they appear in functions that set their values .
# # Translate Excel into Power Apps
You can use formulas for a wide variety of scenarios :
Using formulas to build apps has many advantages :
* You must manually update the running total . Automatic recalculation won &apos;t do it for you .
# # Use a global variable
How global variables work :
Let &apos;s rebuild our adding machine by using a global variable :
8 . To show all the places where the variable is defined and used , select it .
Power Apps has three types of variables :
&#124; Variables type &#124; Scope &#124; Description &#124; Functions that establish &#124;
# # Create and remove variables
# # Variable lifetime and initial value
All variables are held in memory while the app runs . After the app closes , the values that the variables held are lost .
When the user opens the app , all variables have an initial value of * blank * .
You use the variable &apos;s name to read its value . For example , you can define a variable with this formula :
# # Use a context variable
Let &apos;s look at how our adding machine would be created using a context variable instead of a global variable .
How context variables work :
Let &apos;s rebuild our adding machine by using a context variable :
9 . To show where the context variable is defined and used , select it .
Finally , let &apos;s look at creating our adding machine with a collection . Since a collection holds a table that is easy to modify , we will make this adding machine keep a &quot; paper tape &quot; of each value as they are entered .
How collections work :
# Button control in Power Apps
A control that the user can click or tap to interact with the app .
# # # Add a basic formula to a button
6 . ( optional ) Repeat the previous step one or more times .
# # # Configure a button with multiple formulas
Add a formula that clears the * * Text input * * control between entries .
# # # Add another button to reset the total
Add a second button to clear the total between calculations .
# # # Change a button &apos;s appearance
&gt; The color value can be any CSS color definition , either a name or a hex value .

# Create a custom page template to render an RSS feed
# # # RSS Feed ( Web Template )
Now all that &apos;s left is to create a new web page using the RSS Feed template to host our feed . When we request this new web page , we &apos;ll receive our RSS feed XML :
With Power Apps apps , use views to define how a list of records for a specific entity is displayed in the application . A view defines :
- The columns to display
- How wide each column should be
- How the list of records should be sorted by default
- What default filters should be applied to restrict which records will appear in the list
A drop-down list of views is frequently displayed in the application so that people have options for different views of entity data .
# # Types of Views
This topic is about how system administrators and system customizers work with system and public views .
&#124; Quick Find &#124; The default view used when searches are performed using Quick Find . This view also defines which fields are searched when using search capabilities of Quick Find and Lookup views . &#124;
&#124; Advanced Find &#124; The default view used to display results when using Advanced Find . This view also defines the columns used by default when new custom public views or personal views are created without defining a view to use as a template . &#124;
&#124; Associated &#124; The default view that lists the related entities for a record . &#124;
&#124; Lookup &#124; The view you see when you select a record to set for a lookup field . &#124;
&#124; Quick Find Active * entity plural name * &#124; Quick Find &#124;
&#124; * entity name * Advanced Find View &#124; Advanced Find &#124;
As a system customizer you can customize the views through controls by making grids ( lists ) editable and compatible for Unified Interface . The following controls are used :
# Toggle control in Power Apps
A control that the user can turn on or off by moving its handle .
A toggle is designed for recent GUIs but behaves the same way as a check box .

# Run an app in a web browser
&gt; Using the web browser on your phone to run your model-driven apps isn &apos;t supported ; you must use the Dynamics 365 for phones app .
To follow this quickstart , you need :
- Access to an app that you built or that someone else built and shared with you .
- Access to a supported web browser and operating system .
# # Sign in to Dynamics 365
# # Find an app on the Home page

title : &quot; Guidelines on working with embedded canvas apps &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
This topic provides guidelines on working with embedded canvas apps as well as helpful tips to troubleshoot any issues you might encounter .
- Embedded canvas apps are only supported with Unified Interface model-driven apps .
- You can only enable one embedded canvas app per form .
- You can have multiple embedded canvas apps added to the form but can only enable one at a time .
- If you try to enable more than one embedded canvas app on a model-driven form you will get a message that reads “ Only one canvas app can be enabled on a form . ”
- When adding an embedded canvas app to a model-driven form always use a required field that is guaranteed to have a value . If your field does not have a value your embedded canvas app will not refresh in response to any change in data on the host model-driven form .
- Publishing a model-driven form does not also publish the embedded canvas app .
- Embedded canvas apps are not displayed when creating a new record since they need a record context to be passed to them .
- The ModelDrivenFormIntegration.Item object is read-only .
- Embedded canvas apps can only be created via the host model-driven form .
- Adding existing canvas apps as embedded on model-driven forms is currently not supported .
- Support to embed an existing canvas app in a model-driven form using App ID will be provided in a future update .
- Adding a canvas app on the sub-grid control is no longer available .
- In the preview release , makers were able to add a canvas app on a sub-grid control . With canvas app embedding on model-driven forms now generally available , adding an embedded canvas app on a model-driven form is streamlined to the field .
# # Enable an embedded canvas app
1 . Select the field that is customized to display as an embedded canvas app .
# # Disable an embedded canvas app
# # Known issues and limitations with embedded canvas apps
- The ModelDrivenFormIntegration control does not provide a value for fields of a related entity .
- * ItemId * is empty at authoring time but will have a value at runtime .
# iFrame properties for model-driven app main forms
You can add iFrames to a form to integrate content from another website within a form .
To view IFrame properties , follow these steps .
&gt; Forms are not designed to be displayed within an iFrame .
# # Pass parameters to iFrames
# Add , configure , move , or delete fields on a form
Add , configure , move , or delete fields using the form designer .
# # Add fields to a form
# # # Add fields to a form using drag and drop
5 . Drop the field in the location you want . Note the following :
- Fields can be dropped before or after any existing field or component .
- Fields can also be dropped in the empty area within a section . In this case the field will be added in an available space so as to evenly distribute fields and components across the section columns .
- Hovering over a tab header when dragging a field changes the currently selected tab , allowing you to add the field to a different tab .
6 . Repeat steps 3-5 above if you want to add more fields .
# # # Add fields to a form using selection
2 . In the form preview , select another existing field or section . Note the following :
- When you select an existing field , the new field is added after the existing field .
- When you select a section , the new field is added in an available space so as to evenly distribute fields across the section columns .
# # Configure fields on a form
These are the properties available to configure a field when you create or edite a form using the form designer .
&gt; In the Unified Interface , the label size setting is ignored because the form adjusts width for all fields to ensure proper rendering for screen sizes from very small to extra-large .
# # Move fields on a form
You can move a field on a form using drag and drop or cut and paste actions .
# # # Move fields on a form using drag and drop
3 . Repeat step 2 above if you want to move more fields .
# # # Move fields on a form using cut and paste
2 . In the form preview , select the field that you want to move .
6 . Repeat steps 2-5 above if you want to move more fields .
# # Delete fields on a form
2 . In the form preview , select the field that you want to delete from the form .
4 . Repeat steps 2-3 if you want to delete more fields .
&gt; - You can &apos;t delete a field that is locked or is required and not present anywhere else on the form .
# # Create a new field on the entity when editing a form
&gt; When a field is created on the entity , it is not limited to the current form and will be available for use in other places .
# # # Navigate to an unmanaged solution
Tests for a match or extracts portions of a text string based on a pattern .
The key to using these functions is in describing the pattern to match . You describe the pattern in a text string as a combination of :
&#124; Match enum &#124; Description &#124; Regular expression &#124;
&#124; MatchOptions enum &#124; Description &#124; Impact on a regular expression &#124;

# Add a conditional step type
&#124; Condition &#124; The Conditional expression to be evaluated &#124;
The available operands are as follows :
The format of the expression is as follows :
A condition can have multiple expressions . You can use parentheses to group nested expressions , for example :
# Migrate identity providers to Azure AD B2C
# # Marking an identity provider as deprecate
You can configure your portal to mark other identity providers as deprecated and allow users to migrate to Azure AD B2C identity provider .
The following site settings are used to control the deprecation of identity providers :
When a portal user tries to sign in , and you have marked at least one identity provider as deprecated , the deprecated account is shown on the page . In the following example , a Microsoft account is marked as deprecated .
The text on the screen for legacy authentication provider can be changed by using the following content snippet :
&gt; The deprecated identity providers are not shown when a user registers or redeems an invitation for a portal .
# # Migrating a deprecated identity provider to a new identity provider
If a portal user signs in with a deprecated identity provider , the account migration screen displays a message to sign in with a non-deprecated identity provider . When the user signs in with the non-deprecated identity provider , the user account is associated with the new provider .
When a portal user selects a new identity provider and the identity is already associated with another contact record , an error message appears . You can configure the error message using the following content snippets :
&gt; If you mark local login as deprecated , the user will not be able to register for a new account .
The following field is added in the portal contact record to indicate if the local login is disabled for a user :
The details of an authentication key are displayed on Power Apps Portals admin center and portal .
&gt; To view authentication key information , you must sign in to the portal in the same browser session and you must have all website access permission .

Email notifications are sent at the following intervals :
You &apos;ll also be notified after the key expires every day until 1 week after key expiration .
&gt; - Intervals are calculated in UTC from the key expiration date .
A message about key expiration is displayed at the top of the page .
&gt; You must sign in to your portal in the same browser session , and you must be assigned all website access permission .
# # Renew portal authentication key
You must renew the key every two years to ensure that your portal can connect to Common Data Service environment .
&gt; To renew the key , you must have permissions to manage your portal .
&gt; - While this process runs in the background , the portal will restart once .
&gt; - When you update a key , it &apos;s valid for next two years .
&gt; - This process will take five to seven minutes .
&gt; - Updating authentication key doesn &apos;t change any other portal configuration or the portal state .

# Embed a Power BI report in a model-driven system form
You can use Power BI reports in Power Apps model-driven apps to bring rich reporting and analytics to your system forms and empower your users to accomplish more . This unlocks the power to aggregate data across systems , and tailor it down to the context of a single record .
Note that this uses the same control as the unfiltered report embedding , and hence the control class id remains unchanged .
This table describes any additional properties used in the previous example .
# # Remove unmodified attribute before import
# # Known issues and limitations
- This integration is available only in the Unified Interface client , on supported web browsers and mobile devices .
- Opening this form in the Power Apps form designer will not show the control in a meaningful way . This is because the control is customized outside of the form designer .
- If the form doesn ’ t show the Power BI report after importing the solution and publishing customizations , open it in the model-driven form editor and save it , so that the form JSON is regenerated .

# Power BI tile control in Power Apps
To that value , append this syntax :
The parameter will filter a value in the dataset of the report where the tile originates . However , filtering feature has the following limitations :
- Only one filter can be applied .
- Only the `eq` operator is supported .
- Field type must be string .
You can use computed fields in the Power BI report to convert other value types to string or combines multiple fields into one .
3 . Select a dashboard in the list of dashboards , and then select a tile in the list of tiles .
The control renders the Power BI tile .
# Share canvas-app resources in Power Apps
* a connection to a data source
* an on-premises data gateway
* a custom connector
* an Excel workbook or other service
* a flow
Some of these resources are shared automatically when you share the app . Other resources require you or the people with whom you share the app to take extra steps so that the app works as you expect .
You can also share your connections , custom connectors and on-premises data gateway with your entire organization .
&gt; If you share one or more connections manually , you might need to reshare them under these circumstances :
* You add an on-premises data gateway to an app that you ’ ve already shared .
* You change the set of people or groups with whom you ’ ve shared an app that has an on-premises data gateway .
When you share an app that uses a custom connector , it is automatically shared , but users must create their own connections to it .
Customizable help lets you provide your own contextual information to model-driven app users filling in forms .
Customizable Help can be set at the global and entity levels .
# # # Set customizable Help at the global level
People with the system administrator security role can use the settings to override default Help at the global level .
After you enable custom Help at the global level , system customizers can override the global Help URL for an entity in the entity definition .
# # # # Append parameters to URL
Examples of the parameters that can be appended to the URL :
- Entry Point : hierarchy chart or form
An administrator determines whether your organization ’ s users are permitted to sync Dynamics 365 data to Outlook by using security roles .
title : &quot; Translate localizable text for model-driven apps &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# Translate localizable text for model-driven apps
If you have customized entity or field text , such as field labels or drop-down list values , you can provide the users in your environment who are not working with the base language version of your environment with this customized text in their preferred languages .
The process has the following steps :
1 . Enable other languages for your environment
2 . Export the localizable text
3 . Get the localizable text translated
4 . Import the localized text
# # Enable other languages for your environment
&gt; Each language can take several minutes to enable . During this time , other users of the environment may not be able to use your app . You should enable languages at time that will be least disruptive to users .
# # Export the localizable text
The scope of the localizable text that will be exported is the unmanaged solution that contains the localizable text .
You could see an alert that says :
&gt; Exporting customized labels for translation can take several minutes . Do not click the export link again until the first export has finished . Are you sure that you want to export now ?
# # Get the localizable text translated
You can send this file to a linguistic expert , translation agency , or localization firm .
If you have the knowledge to translate the text , or if you just want to see the format , you can extract the zip file that you exported you will see that it contains two XML files .
&gt; Make sure you do not change the file format . If you save the file in another format you will not be able to import it back .
Any custom entities or fields will have empty cells for the localizable text . Add the localized values for those items .
# # # Updating localizable text in the base language
&gt; Do not do a general find / replace in the file for this . You should take care that the matching text actually refers to the names you have changed .
# # Import the localized text
Importing the text requires compressing the files and importing them into the system .
# # # Compress the files
# # # Import the files
Select the file that contains the compressed translated text and select * * Import * * .
After the translated text is imported , you should publish all customizations to see the changes in your app ( s ) .
&gt; The community tools are not supported by Microsoft .
# Create many-to-many entity relationships overview
With Many-to-many relationships a Relationship ( or Intersect ) entity stores the data that associates the entities . This entity has a One-to-many entity relationship with both of the related entities and only stores the necessary values to define the relationship . You can ’ t add custom fields to a relationship entity and it is never visible in the user interface .
- Configure navigation pane options for model-driven apps .
- Hide the relationship from Advanced find in model-driven apps .
# Render up to three levels of page hierarchy by using hybrid navigation
* If the current page has children , those child pages are shown .
* If the current page has no children , the siblings of the current page are shown .
# Split function in Power Apps
There are some advantages to configuring dataflows to store their definitions and datafiles in your data lake , including the following :
- A resource group . Use a resource group you already have , or create a new one .
3 . The storage account must have the Hierarchical Name Space feature enabled .
4 . You must be granted an Owner role on the storage account .
The following sections walk through the steps necessary to configure your Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account .
# # Create the storage account
2 . Make sure you enable the hierarchical namespace feature .
# # Select the storage account to use for dataflow storage
The * * Select Storage Account * * screen appears .
There are a few considerations and limitations to keep in mind when working with your dataflow storage :
- Once a dataflow storage location is configured for a dataflow , it can &apos;t be changed .
You can &apos;t change the storage location of a dataflow after it was created .
* When can I change the dataflow storage location of an environment ? *
Changing the environment &apos;s dataflow storage location is not currently supported .

title : &quot; Add geolocation to a managed form in a portal &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
A managed form can be configured to display a map control either to display an existing location as a pin on a map or to provide the ability for the user to specify a location .
To add geolocation functionality to a managed form , the following tasks must be completed .
Edit the entity form by using the form designer and make the following modifications :
The resulting form should look similar to the following . You can choose different display names for these fields . You can also choose to lay out these sections any way you prefer .
Geolocation with map functionality on managed forms requires configuration settings to complete requests with the mapping service REST endpoint . The following site settings are used to configure the location service .
The map control requires additional configuration to tell it what the IDs of the various location fields are , so it can assign values to them or retrieve values from them . The configuration depends on the type of managed form .
&gt; If you remove an option which has been used by an entity record the data for that record will become invalid after you save your changes to the global option set .
&gt; Before you remove an option that has been used , you should change the data in any entity record that uses that option to a valid value .
title : &quot; Create , edit or configure forms using the model-driven form designer &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# Create , edit , or configure forms using the form designer
Use the new form designer to create , edit , or configure forms for model-driven apps .
The contents of the new form are filled using the existing main form definition . If multiple main forms exist , the form at the top of the list in the form order is used to fill the new form .
4 . Select the form name that you want to edit .
These are the properties available to configure a form when you create or edit a form using the form designer .
# Size and location properties in Power Apps
# Working with Test Studio ( experimental )
You don &apos;t need to enable this feature in your app like other experimental features . Test Studio is available by default for all canvas apps .
&gt; You must save an app before you can write tests for the app .
&gt; Tests are published and stored in the app package . Exporting and importing a canvas app package to another environment will also include all the test definitions such as test suites and test cases you have created .
# # Create a test suite
# # Create a test case
Depending on how you want to organize or group your tests , you can create multiple test cases in a test suite . Each case can test a specific feature or a subset of functionalities in your app .
1 . Select a test suite .
# # Record a test case
&gt; Only a published app plays in record mode . Publish any recent changes to the app before you start recording a test case . Recording without publishing recent changes causes the last published version of the app to play in record mode .
&gt; Recording on an existing test case overrides any existing test steps already present .
5 . Edit the step description text in the main grid if necessary . You can also update the test step actions by selecting the formula on the main grid .
# # # Add test steps and test assertions
Follow these steps to verify a successful record creation :
- Initialize a variable for the kudo record count in the database at the beginning of the test case .
- Initialize a variable for the kudo record count in the database at the end of the test case .
- Write a test assertion expression to validate it incremented by one count . If the count doesn &apos;t increase by one , the test assertion fails , and your test case fails .
To add test steps and test assertions in the Kudos app :
1 . Select Step 1 or the step above which you want to insert a new step .
8 . Go to the bottom of the test case and insert a new step to count the records in the database after the test has completed .
10 . Save the test case from the top-right menu in Test Studio .
# # Play back your test
You can play back your recorded test to validate app functionality . You can play back all tests within a single test suite , or a single test case .
Before you play the recording back with recent changes , you must publish the app :
&gt; If you skip publishing , the recording playback will not contain your recent test changes . The last published test case or suite will play against the app .
2 . Select either a test suite or a single test case .
In this section , you &apos;ll change the test assertion to experience a failed test :
1 . Edit the assertion step by selecting the expression box .
5 . View the test playing back . The final step now fails and shows an error and the message you provided in the assertion step .
# # # Playing tests in a browser
To play tests in your browser :
1 . Select a test suite or test case in the right pane .
3 . You &apos;re prompted to publish your tests if there are any unpublished changes .
4 . You can select to skip the publish process and copy the play link . New test changes don &apos;t play if you skip .
5 . Open a browser and paste the URL into the address bar to play the test .
6 . View your test playing back .
- Always starting test execution from the first screen .
- Initializing common collections or variables .
3 . Input an expression to Navigate to first screen and fetch the test data for your test .
The expression entered for these properties triggers when each case or suite completes . You can customize these properties to process and send the results of your tests to various data sources or services such as :
- * StartTime * – the start execution time of the test .
- * StartTime * – the start execution time of the test suite .
Other examples of expressions you could use in these properties are :
- Send results to a flow in Power Automate .
- Email your results .
- Receive an app notification of the test result .
For example , receive a notification after the test completes when playing the test in a browser , outside of Test Studio .
title : &quot; Create a personal view using advanced grid filters &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# Edit or create personal views using advanced grid filters
Use the advanced filter options to create a personal view to see the records that are important to you . The advanced filter options let you create a wide range of views from simple to complex . It also lets you add grouped and nested conditions to the filters .
&gt; - The advanced filter option is available only in English language versions . We plan to support more languages in future releases .
&gt; - In the Unified Interface grids do not prepopulate column filters based on the current view definition .
# # See the current view definition

Canvas apps reference each image or other media file , whether it &apos;s in the cloud or added as an app resource , by a URI text string .
That URI displays a scaled-up version of two purple diamonds :
As text strings and URIs , these data types have no preset limit on their length .
As a best practice , hold data in memory only as long as necessary . Upload images to a database as soon as you can ; download images only when the app &apos;s user requests them .
# # Date , Time , and DateTime
Date / time values fall in these categories :

# Before you build a text classification model
Before you build your text classification model , you &apos;ll need to make sure your data is in Common Data Service , and in the correct format .
- Training data should be in a Common Data Service entity .
- Make sure your administrator has assigned you a security role with read privilege over the training data .
- Tags should be separated using a delimiter . We currently support the following delimiters : comma ( , ) , semicolon ( ; ) , tab , and no separator .
- Tags that contain fewer than 50 text items are ignored .
- Text must be fewer than 5,000 characters .
If we represent data in a table , it would look like this :

# GitHub contribution workflow for major or long-running changes
Examples of these types of contributions include :
In this workflow , changes flow in a repetitive cycle . Starting from your device &apos;s local repository , they flow back up to your GitHub fork , into the main GitHub repository , and back down locally again as you incorporate changes from other contributors .
# # # Use GitHub flow
# # Saving changes to your repository
Next , you need to commit your saved changes to your local repository . This can be done in Git Bash by running :
You &apos;ve done it ! Your code is now up in your GitHub repository and ready for you to create a pull request .
&gt; Even though your changes become visible in your personal GitHub account when you push them , there is no rule that you need to submit a pull request immediately . If you want to come stop and return at a later time to make additional tweaks , that &apos;s OK !
You &apos;re now back in a new branch and you &apos;re well on your way to being a master contributer .
That &apos;s it ! You &apos;ve made a contribution to docs.microsoft.com content !
# # # Review and sign-off
When the pull request is issue-free and signed off , your changes are merged back into the parent branch and the pull request is closed .
title : Labels and projects roadmap
This roadmap explains how we use these organizational tools and has links to handy filters we use to find areas of interest .
We use labels to classify issues in many different ways :
You can combine a label from each set ( guide , release , priority ) to create a narrow focus to find issues you want to work on .
# # # Find a single .NET guide
We use labels for each of the architecture e-books and for each .NET Guide .
- Async Task
- C # Get Started
Priority labels are all `P` followed by a single digit . Lower numbers are higher priority :
# # # What about the other labels ?
There are many other labels used by the content teams to manage different classifications of issues . If you &apos;re not on the content team , you can ignore these other labels .
We use projects in two ways :
- Month YYYY project types : These are scrum boards for each month &apos;s working plan .
- Long-running epics : These are used to organize tasks toward a goal when the work will occur over several months .

# Set up Git repository locally for documentation
This article describes the steps to set up a Git repository on your local machine , with the intent to contribute to Microsoft documentation . Contributors may use a locally cloned repository to add new articles , do major edits on existing articles , or change artwork .
You run these one-time setup activities to start contributing :
&gt; * Determine the appropriate repository
&gt; * Fork the repository to your GitHub account
&gt; * Choose a local folder for the cloned files
&gt; * Clone the repository to your local machine
&gt; * Configure the upstream remote value
For example , these popular repositories are available for public contributions :
Using the appropriate repository , create a fork of the repository into your own GitHub account by using the GitHub website .
# # Choose a local folder
To determine the current directory , type `pwd` at the $ prompt .
# # Create a local clone
Your clone command should look similar to this example :

# # What you need to know when designing business process flows with branches
Take notice of the following information when you design the business process flow with the branches :
- A process can span across a maximum of 5 unique entities .
- Each branch can be no more that 5 levels deep .
- Branching rule must be based on the steps in the stage that immediately precedes it .
- You can combine multiple conditions in a rule by using the `AND` operator or the `OR` operator , but not both operators .
- More than one active process can run concurrently on the same data record .
- Client API changes cannot trigger evaluation of branching condition , as branching relies on Business rules .
&gt; - An entity used in the process can be revisited multiple times ( multiple closed entity loops ) .
# # Example : Car selling process flow with two branches
Let ’ s look at the example of the business process flow with two branches , for selling new and pre-owned cars .
First , we ’ ll create a new process named * * Car Sales Process * * .
1 . Configure the condition tile with rules that meet your business requirements
2 . To add the first branch for a stage , add a Stage tile on the “ Yes ” path of the condition tile
3 . To add the second branch that is executed when condition is not satisfied , add another Stage tile on the “ No ” path of the condition tile
&gt; You can add another condition on the “ no ” path of an existing condition tile to create more complex branching .
Consider a business process flow with branches for processing a loan request at a bank , as shown below . The custom entities used in the stages are shown in parenthesis .

# # More about workflows and Actions
Power Automate is a cloud-based service that makes it practical and simple for line-of-business users to build workflows that automate time-consuming business tasks and processes across applications and services .
Power Automate has two distinct audiences :
* Line-of-business “ Citizen Integrators ” in enterprise organizations who partner with IT to move responsibility for business solutions closer to the business itself .
To use Power Automate , all you need is a web browser and an email address .
We recommend that you use the most up-to-date browser that &apos;s compatible with your operating system . We support the following browsers :
# # # Which email addresses are supported ?
Power Automate supports email addresses that end with anything except .gov and .mil .
Power Automate is a public cloud service only . However , you can securely connect to your own on-premises services through the on-premises data gateway .
# # # What are templates ?
Templates are pre-built flows for popular and common scenarios . Using a template only requires you to have access to the services in the template and to fill out any required settings .
# # # What data sources will I be able to connect to ?
# # # Can I share the flows I create ?
You can share flows in either of these ways :
* You can add co-workers or groups in your organization as owners on your flows , so they can also edit and manage the flow .
* For flows that can be run manually , you can also grant other people or groups in your organization permission to just run the flow .
# # # How many flows can I have ?
Get started with the following resources :
# # # Can flows be turned off or disabled ?
Yes , each flow has an on / off switch that enables you to stop the flow from processing requests .
See the following table to understand how your flow responds when it &apos;s turned back on .
Trigger type &#124; Description
Webhook &#124; When the flow is turned on again , it only processes new events that are generated after the flow is turned on .
While you can create flows with a service account , we don &apos;t recommend doing so if the credentials for the service account are shared .
The admin center is the central location where tenant admins and environment admins manage an organization ’ s data policies and environments . Any changes you make in the admin center are immediately available to users within the organization .
# # Access the admin center
# # Respond to DSRs for Power Automate customer data

title : &quot; Work with business process flows using code &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# Work with business process flows using code
Different business process flow instances can run concurrently against the same entity record . Users can switch between concurrent business process instances , and resume their work at a current stage in the process .
This topic provides information about how you can programmatically work with business process flows .
# # Prerequisites for business process flow
&gt; Enabling an entity for business process flow is a one way process . You can ’ t reverse it .
# # Define business process flow
By default , a business process flow record is created in the `Draft` state .
&gt; You can also use the business process flow designer to activate a business process flow .
# # Business process flow entity
&gt; The sample business process flow records use system entities to store the corresponding business process flow instance records .
&gt; However , any new business process flow definitions you create will use custom entities to store its instance records as explained earlier .
You can retrieve the name of your business process flow entity using any of the following ways :
# # Manage security for business process flows
At this point , you might not get any instances in your response as there are none . Run this request after creating an instance of your business process flow definition later in this topic .
Create a business process flow entity record ( process instance ) programmatically if you want to switch to another business process flow for an entity record without using the UI .
To create a business process flow entity record , you need to specify the following values :
You can update a process instance to move to next or previous stage , abandon a process instance , reactivate a process instance , or finish a process instance .
# # # # Stage navigation
To navigate to a different stage , you need to update a process instance record to change its active stage ID and accordingly update the traversed path . Note that you must only move to the next or previous stage while updating a business process flow instance .
Assuming the ID of the process instance you want to update is dc2ab599-306d-e811-80ff-00155d513100 , use the following request to update the active stage from S1 to S2 :
&gt; You can abort a process instance at any stage .
Use the following Web API request :
# # Use RetrieveProcessInstances and RetrieveActivePath messages
# # Apply business process flow while creating an entity record
By default , for an entity that has multiple business process flows defined for it , the system applies a business process flow to the new entity record using the following multi-step logic :
- If the business app does not contain any business process flow then business process flow is applied as explained until step 3 .
- Set it to a specific business process flow entity ( as an entity reference ) . In this case , the system will apply the specified business process flow instead of the default logic .
&gt; Overriding the default logic of business process flows getting applied automatically to new entity records is only supported programmatically . You cannot do this using the UI .
# # Legacy process-related attributes in entities
# # Client-side programmability support for business process flows
# # Maximum number of processes , stages , and steps
The following settings aren ’ t customizable :
- The maximum number of stages per entity in the process is 30 .
- The maximum number of steps in each stage is 30 .
- The maximum number of entities that can participate in the process flow is 5 .
title : Adaptive Cards metadata update card sample &#124; Microsoft Docs
This card is comprised of three sections :
1 . The topic header area with header , sub-header , and description .
1 . A column set which supports a table array of data
# Use adaptive cards in Microsoft Teams
1 . Set the schedule as follows to repeat every week , at a time and time zone of your choice :
1 . Give your flow a name and save it .
Notice , after the recurrence time elapses , the flow posts the adaptive card &apos;s content to the team channel that you defined .
# Create your first adaptive card
In either case you will need to sketch out which datasets you will share , and / or what data the form will need to collect .
- Microsoft Teams with the Flow App installed .
In this procedure , you ’ ll add an action which will use the data from previous actions in the flow to post information to a Microsoft Teams channel .
1 . Give your flow a name .
1 . Make the following replacements in the JSON .
&gt; Do not remove any quotation marks when you do the replacements . You can revise the car choices to suit your needs :
Text to change &#124; New text
Header Tagline Text &#124; Power Automate Poll
Poll Header &#124; Preferred Car Model
&#124; Poll Question &#124; Please vote on your preferred car model from the choices listed here .
# # Test your adaptive card
To test your work , run the flow you created earlier and confirm the following :
- The Teams channel has the new adaptive card posted .
- No errors should occur on the adaptive card .
- The flow run completes successfully .
- The email notification contains the body that shows who submitted the response and which car was selected .
Congratulations ! you ’ ve just made your first interactive adaptive card !
# # Troubleshooting tips for adaptive cards
The most common problems that you will encounter when creating adaptive cards are :
- Flow run errors are often caused by one of the following factors :
- Improperly formatted JSON – This is not usually as complex as one might expect . These are most often just situations where :
- Adaptive Cards may not look like what ’ s expected during to styling and schema constraints :
- Errors following Adaptive Card submission are often due to :
- Using an action which does not include ‘ wait for response ’ in the name
- Attempting to submit the card more than once . Each Adaptive Card can only be submit once , after which all further submissions will be ignored .
title : &quot; Best practices for managing workflow processes &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# Best practices for workflow processes
This topic contains best practices for creating and managing workflow processes .
It ’ s possible to create logic in a workflow that initiates an infinite loop , which consumes server resources and affects performance . The typical situation where an infinite loop might occur is if you have a workflow configured to start when an attribute is updated and then updates that attribute in the logic of the workflow . The update action triggers the same workflow that updates the record and triggers the workflow again and again .
If you have workflows that are similar and you anticipate creating more workflows that follow the same pattern , save your workflow as a workflow template . This way , the next time you need to create a similar workflow , create the workflow using the template and avoid entering all the conditions and actions from scratch .
# # Automatically delete completed workflow jobs
# # Keep logs for workflow jobs that encountered errors
# # Limit the number of workflows that update the same entity
# # Use Notes to keep track of changes
When you edit workflows you should use the Notes tab and type what you did and why you did it . This allows someone else to understand the changes you made .
# Trigger a flow from any message in Microsoft Teams
&gt; You must sign into Teams if you are not already signed in .
# # Collect information from the user
This displays an inline adaptive card editor which lets you drag and drop card elements to construct your own form .
# # # Use the message details within the flow
There several message elements available as a trigger output for use within the flow . Here &apos;s an overview of some of properties :
* Message content - The full HTML content of the Teams message .
* Plain text message output - The plain text variation of the Teams message .
* Link to message - A direct url to reference the message .
* Sender display name , Sender id - The details of the user who sent the message .
* Originating user display name , originating user id - The details of the user who invoked the flow .
&gt; The name of the flow is used to reference the flow within Teams so be sure to provide a descriptive name for the flow .
&gt; You must create these flows within the default environment to ensure they get listed in Teams .
Here &apos;s an example of a flow that creates a work item in Azure Devops and then posts a confirmation to the originating user .
You must create these flows within the default environment to ensure they get listed in Teams .

# # What can you do with Power Automate ?
For example , you can * * automate * * these tasks :
* Instantly respond to high-priority notifications or emails .
* Capture , track , and follow up with new sales leads .
* Copy files from one service to another .
* Collect data about your business , and share that information with your team .
* Automate approval workflows .
# # Where can I create and administer a flow ?
You can perform these tasks , among others :
* Turn flows on or off from wherever you are .
* See when a flow has failed .
* Review detailed run-history reports .
* View and filter runs by notification type .
# # A brief tour of Power Automate
Let &apos;s jump into the tool , and we &apos;ll show you around . We have tons of information for you to learn about how to use Power Automate .
On the home page , there are menus for :
On the * * Templates * * page , you can have a look at some of the most popular templates , which should give you great ideas for flows you want to try .
Now that you &apos;ve gotten a taste of what Power Automate is and what it can do , let &apos;s take a look at what makes a flow .
title : &quot; Best practices for using business process flow entity attributes &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# Best practices in using business process flow attributes
# # Reporting on the active stage of a business process flow
Let ’ s say that you ’ d like to get a view of your sales pipeline by reporting on the active stage that the * * Lead to Opportunity Sales Process * * is on .
In our example , follow these steps to go to the * * Lead to Opportunity Sales Process * * entity :
Here , you can define views and charts just as you do on any other entity .
An advantage of this approach is that you can use a single view or chart to report on business process flows that span multiple entities .
Here are a few things to keep in mind when you use this approach :
# # Using the active stage to run logic
Here are some cases in which you might want to run logic that &apos;s based on the active stage :
# # # Using the active stage to run client-side logic
As you use the business process , there are many things that you might want to do automatically . For instance :
- Change the active business process flow based on newly available information on the form or business process flow .
- Move the active stage to the next or previous stage , based on values the users entered for steps or form fields .
- Hide or show form tabs and fields based on the selected stage .
- Show informative messages and run calculations based on the active business process flows , the active or selected stage , or events such as moving the active stage .
# # # Using the active stage to run server-side logic
There might be cases where automation based on the business process flow needs to be done server side . For instance :
&gt; Use classic Common Data Service workflows or flows you define on the entity for the business process flow .
1 . Create an appointment and phone call record for the internal review of the solution and the customer call to review the solution respectively .
title : Partner Sales and Marketing learning catalog
# Partner Sales and Marketing Learning Catalog
Are you responsible for helping your customers buy the right solution ?
# Watch your flows in action
To ensure that your flows run as you expect , perform the trigger , and then review the inputs and outputs that each step in your flow generates .
1 . Perform the starting action for your flow .
The starting action and each subsequent step indicates whether it succeeded and how long it took .
As a developer , you can extend Power Automate , enabling even more powerful solutions for organizations and customers .
# # Power Automate for enterprise developers
As an enterprise developer , empower your organization to build robust tailored solutions on Power Automate :
# # Power Automate for ISVs and Microsoft partners
&#124; Phase &#124; Step &#124; When needed ? &#124;
# # # 1 . Connecting to your APIs OR Enabling customers to connect to your APIs
Once created , there are two ways to make the connector available to your customers :
# # # 2 . Authentication
# # # 3 . Embedding UI components
# # # 4 . Create and publish flow templates
# # # 5 . Deployment
# # # 6 . Licensing
# # Create the source and target folders
So far , you ’ ve configured your flow with the following steps :
1 . The flow is triggered whenever a new file is added to a specific OneDrive for Business folder
2 . The Muhimbi service converts that file to PDF .
For the final step , you ’ ll add an action that will move the PDF document to a SharePoint Online folder where the team can access it .
title : Update UI flows app and connections from previous releases &#124; Microsoft Docs
# Upgrade UI flows app and connections from previous releases
# # # What does it mean for my existing UI flows ?
No action is required until you either update the UI flows app or the connection to the gateway . You must update both at the same time .
# # # How do I upgrade ?
1 . For each device on which you have installed the UI flows app :
1 . Edit the UI flows connection ( s ) that target your device .
1 . Enter your credentials for the connection , and then save it .
# Create approval flows with attachments
In this article , you ’ ll learn how to create an approval flow that sends an attachment that the approver needs to review before deciding if the request should be approved .
The previous steps configure your flow so that when it runs , it requests a file from the user to trigger your flow .
&gt; You must include the file extension that matches the file type that &apos;s uploaded .
You &apos;ll see that the test run starts .
&gt; Approvers can review requests in the approvals center as well .

1 . Rectify : Make changes or implement other requested actions on the personal data , where applicable .
If a data subject asks you to rectify their personal data that resides in your organization , you and your organization must determine if it ’ s appropriate to honor the request . Rectifying the data may include taking actions such as editing , redacting , or removing personal data .
title : Use custom controls in business process flows &#124; Microsoft Docs
# # Adding custom controls to a business process
Here are the steps you must follow to add custom controls to a business process flow :
1 . Configure custom controls on a related entity form .
1 . Generate and exporting the business process flow form .
1 . Copy custom control configurations to the business process flow form from the related entity form .
# Tutorial : Create a business process flow to standardize processes
When a user starts a business process flow , the stages and steps of the process are displayed in the process bar at the top of a form :
# # Create a business process flow
You cannot change the category after you create the process .
The new process is created , and the business process flow designer opens with a single stage already created for you .
- Enter a display name .
1 . Enter a display name for the step .
2 . If you want users to enter data to complete a step , select the appropriate field from the drop-down list .
1 . Enter a display name .
2 . Select when the workflow should be triggered .
&gt; As long as a process is a draft , people won ’ t be able to use it .
&gt; The System Administrator and System Customizer security roles have access to new business process flows by default .
Next , don &apos;t forget to assign the security role to appropriate users in your organization .
&gt; Here are a few tips to keep in mind as you work on your task flow in the designer window :
# # Other things to know about business process flows
Business process flows can have up to 30 stages .
You can add or change the following properties of a stage :
- Relationships often have attribute maps defined that automatically carry over data between records , minimizing data entry .
Each stage can have up to 30 steps .
To make a business process flow available for people to use , you must order the process flow , enable security roles , and activate it .
* * Set Process Flow Order * *
Users have access to a business process flow depending on the privilege defined on the business process flow in the security role assigned to the user .
# # Add an on-demand action to a business process flow
# # # Add on-demand workflows or actions using an Action Step
Suppose that , as part of the opportunity qualification process , the Contoso organization requires all opportunities to be reviewed by a designated reviewer . Subsequently , the Contoso organization created an action that :
- Creates a task record that is assigned to the opportunity reviewer .
- Appends “ Ready for review ” to the opportunity topic .
Next , the Action Step is added to Contoso ’ s opportunity business process flow . Then the process flow is validated and updated .
&gt; - The entity associated with the action or workflow must be the same as the entity associated with the business process flow .
# # # Limitation of using Action Steps in a business process flow
# # Instant flows in business process flows
# # # Add an instant flow as a step in a business process
To do this , you &apos;ll need to do two things :
# # # Build an instant flow
1 . Add a text input field for the user to enter the link to the proposal .
We &apos;ll need information from the business process flow instance to help provide context for the approval request so follow these steps to do this .
Things should look like this now :
1 . Finally , save the flow and then turn it on .
Now that you &apos;ve created the instant flow , all that &apos;s needed is for you to add it to your business process flow .
# # The action center
When you need to see the list of business process flows in which you &apos;re involved , check out the unified action center .
- The name of the process .
- The current stage for each process .
- The owner of the Common Data Service record associated with the active stage .
- The time since the instance was created .
To see the
Select an instance to open it in a new tab , or select it to copy a link , share a link via email , abandon , or delete the instance .
To get these two parameters .
2 . Select the environment you use to build your flows .
3 . Copy the organization id and region subdomain from the environment URL .
The response contains the list of flows from within that environment :
&#124; createdon &#124; The date when the flow was created . &#124;
&#124; name &#124; The display name that you have given the flow . &#124;
&#124; description &#124; The user-provided description of the flow . &#124;
You can also provide a description and statecode .
There are three properties :
Once you execute the `POST` request , you &apos;ll receive the `OData-EntityId` header , which will contain the `workflowid` for your new flow .
In another example , you can turn a flow on with this call :
Delete a flow with a simple `DELETE` call :
# # Get all users with whom a flow is shared
The `Target` parameter is a JSON-like string with a single property called ` @ odata.id`. Replace the workflow ID in the above example . It returns :
# # Share or unshare a flow
You can share a flow using the `GrantAccess` action .
The `AccessMask` parameter is a field with the following values for different permission levels :
&#124; ReadAccess &#124; The right to read the flow . &#124;
&#124; WriteAccess &#124; The right to update the flow . &#124;
&#124; DeleteAccess &#124; The right to delete the flow . &#124;
&#124; ShareAccess &#124; The right to share the flow . &#124;
&#124; AssignAccess &#124; The right to change the owner of the flow . &#124;
You can * unshare * a flow with the `RevokeAccess` action . Here &apos;s an example :
`RevokeAccess` removes all permissions granted in the `AccessMask` .
`ExportSolution` returns a base 64-encoded string in the `ExportSoutionFile` property .
You can then save this file into source control and / or use whatever version management or distribution system you want .
Call the `ImportSolution` action to import a solution .
title : Start flows with Flic buttons &#124; Microsoft Docs
# Run your flows by pressing a Flic smart button ( Preview )
To use Flics with Power Automate , you must have :
Use Flic &apos;s mobile app to program the Flic &apos;s events . The events are :
* click ( one quick press )
* double-click ( two quick presses )
This screenshot shows a sample of what your Flic configuration process might be like :
# # Create a flow that &apos;s triggered by a Flic
Let &apos;s get started creating our flow .
# # # Start with a template
# # # Create a spreadsheet in Google Sheets
1 . Review the template &apos;s details and note that this template requires a spreadsheet in Google Sheets .
Tip : You name columns in Google Sheets by entering the column name at the top of the column . So , your sheet should appear like this screenshot :
Note : You use this sheet later in this walkthrough .
# # # Add the Flic trigger to your flow
* * Continue * * is enabled after you sign into all required services for the template .
On the * * Insert row * * card :
# # # Confirm the email settings are correct
# # # Save your flow and test it
1 . Give your flow a name , and then save it .
If you &apos;ve followed along , pressing the Flic once triggers the flow . The flow then records the click type and the current time in the sheet and then sends an email to you .
4 . Here &apos;s what the body of the notification email that I received from the run of the flow looks like .
For extra credit , consider extending the flow to automatically record your location ( latitude and longitude ) when the Flic is pressed .
When you design workflows you have the option to contain the logic you want to perform in stages and steps .
Stages make the workflow logic easier to read , and explain the workflow logic . However , stages do not affect the logic or behavior of workflows . If a process has stages , all the steps within the process must be contained with a stage .
Steps are a unit of business logic within a workflow . Steps can include conditions , actions , other steps , or a combination of these elements .
# # Actions that workflow processes can perform
Workflow processes can perform the actions listed in the following table .
At the bottom of the dialog you can see a list of additional fields not present in the form .
For any field , you can set a static value and that will be set by the workflow .
# # Setting conditions for workflow actions
# # # Converting between real-time and background workflows
You can change a real-time workflow into a background workflow by choosing * * Convert to a background workflow * * on the toolbar .
# # # Initiating real-time workflows before or after status changes
# # # Using the Stop Workflow action with real-time workflows
&gt; Stop your flow before you begin editing it , or you might lose your changes .
1 . Select the solution that contains the flow you want to edit .
1 . Turn on your flow if you &apos;d like it to run .
You must have the following components to create solutions , and solution-aware flows :
- An environment with version 9.1.0.267 or later .
Follow these steps to create a solution :
Your new solution might appear like this image :
# Design flows in Microsoft Visio
&gt; Many processes share a common model but have minor variations throughout an organization . You can save time within your organization by using Visio to create a master workflow model that others will then adjust with specialized parameters .
# # Design a workflow in Visio
1 . The Visio designer launches .
# # Prepare to export your workflow to Power Automate
Follow these steps to prepare your workflow so that you can export it to Power Automate .
The * * Prepare to Export * * group opens .
Your workflow is ready to be exported when there are no issues remaining on the * * Prepare to Export * * control .
1 . You should see a success report similar to this one .
You can now run or make edits to your flow from the Power Automate designer , just like any other flow .

# Share button flows in Power Automate
To share buttons , you need :
* A flow to share .
* A group or user within your organization with whom to share your button .
1 . Tap the small icon next to the button you want to share .
3 . Search for , and then select the group or person with whom you &apos;d like to share the button .
# # Require users to use their own connections
Follow these steps to require persons with whom you &apos;ve shared your buttons to use their own connections .
Your choice indicates whose connections must be used in the shared button .
# # View the list of button users
You can view all groups or users with whom a button is shared by following these steps from the * * Buttons * * tab :
1 . Tap the small icon next to the button in which you &apos;re interested .
# # Stop sharing a button
You can stop sharing a button by following these steps from the * * Buttons * * tab :
1 . Tap the small icon next to the button you no longer want to share .
# # Monitor the run history
2 . Tap the button you want to use .
You can share a link to a button that &apos;s been shared with you .
# # Stop using a shared button
# Monitor and manage workflow processes
To monitor and manage processes , you must locate the process , evaluate the status , and perform any actions necessary to address problems .
Background workflows generate System Job records to track their status . You can access information about these system jobs in several places within the application :
# # # Actions on running background workflows
# # Monitoring real-time workflows and actions
# # Status of workflow processes
&#124; Ready &#124; Waiting for Resources &#124;
# # Deleting process log records
If your organization uses background workflows or business process flows that run frequently , the amount of process log records can become large enough to cause performance issues as well as consume significant amounts of storage . To delete process log records not removed sufficiently by one of the standard bulk record deletion jobs you can use the bulk delete system jobs feature to create a custom bulk record deletion job .
5 . The following conditions are used to create a bulk record deletion job to delete process log records .
# # # Using the immediately option
The * * Immediately * * option is enabled when the following conditions are true :
- Bulk delete job is for the System Jobs entity .
- The search criteria has the condition system job type equals workflow .
- The user creating the bulk delete job has global depth for the delete privilege on the AsyncOperation entity . The system administrator security role has this privilege .

If you decide that you want to modify or delete one of your flows , it &apos;s easy .
2 . Now , tap one of your flows .
You can see that there are a few options :
* You can always edit the flow , in case you want to make it useful to yourself again .
* And you can see the run history of the flow , to get an idea of its successful and unsuccessful runs .
* You can also delete the flow by tapping the * * Delete flow * * button .
Here , you see the * * flow has been deleted * * .
title : Learn how to create solution-aware flows &#124; Microsoft Docs
# Create a flow in a solution
Flows you create in a solution are known as * solution-aware * flows . Follow these steps to create a solution-aware flow .
You need to have at least one solution before you can create a solution-aware flow .
1 . Select the solution in which you &apos;ll create your flow .
1 . Use the available connectors and triggers to build your flow .
In this example , we &apos;ll build a simple flow that sends a notification when an email arrives in your inbox .
Your flow should appear like this :
By following the steps in this section , you &apos;ll build :
2 . If the left navigation bar doesn &apos;t appear by default , click or tap the icon with three horizontal lines in the upper-left corner .
If your browser window isn &apos;t maximized , this button might appear in a different place .

7 . For the other file in the list , click or tap the arrow to show details about that file .
8 . In the upper-right corner , click or tap the pencil icon to change details about the file .
10 . In the upper-right corner , click or tap the checkmark icon to save your changes and return to the details screen .
In a few minutes , you &apos;ll receive email stating that the file was rejected , and the file will be deleted from Dropbox .
Task flows can use multi-entity forms and logic , and can have form logic that runs across the task flow pages .
# # Create a task flow
- Enter a process name .
The task flow designer opens in a new window .
&gt; As you add pages and conditions to the task flow , you &apos;ll see a minimap in the lower-left corner of the window that shows all the pages and conditions in the task flow .

title : &quot; Business process flows overview &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# # Why use business process flows ?
# # What can business process flows do ?
With business process flows , you define a set of * stages * and * steps * that are then displayed in a control at the top of the form .
# # # Business process flows integrated with other customizations
# # # Concurrent process flows
Concurrent business process flows let customizers configure multiple business processes and associate them with the same starting record . Users can switch between multiple business processes running concurrently , and resume their work at the stage in the process that they were on .
The following business process flows are included . To understand how business process flows work , review these system business process flows :
- Lead to Opportunity Sales Process
- Opportunity Sales Process
- Phone to Case Process
# # Multiple entities in business process flows
You can design business process flows that tie together the records for up to five different entities into a single process so that people using the app can focus on the flow of their process rather than on which entity they are working in . They can more easily navigate between related entity records .
# # Multiple business process flows are available per entity
Not every user in an organization may follow the same process and different conditions may require that a different process be applied . You can have up to 10 active business process flows per entity to provide appropriate processes for different situations .
# # # Control which business process flow will be applied
You can associate business process flows with security roles so that only people with those security roles can see or use them . You can also set the order of the business process flows so that you can control which business process flow will be set by default . This works in the same way that multiple forms for an entity are defined .
# # Business process flow considerations
# # # Business process flows that call a workflow
# # # Entities that can use business process flows
All custom entities can use business process flows . The following standard entities can also use business process flows :
- Recurring Appointment
- Social Activity
# # # Maximum number of processes , stages , and steps
To ensure acceptable performance and the usability of the user interface , there are some limitations you need to be aware of when you plan to use business process flows :
- There can be no more than 10 activated business process flow processes per entity .
- Multi-entity processes can contain no more than five entities .
# # Business process flow entity customization support
# # # Interact with the business process flow entity from a workflow
# # # Run business process flows offline
You can use business process flows offline if the following conditions are met :
- The business process flow is used from a Power Apps app .
- The Power Apps app is enabled for offline use .
- The business process flow has a single entity .
Specifically , the three commands that are available for a business process flow when the Power Apps app is offline are :
- Next stage
- Previous stage
- Set Active stage
# # # Limitations of using business process flow entities
- Currently , you can ’ t create custom forms for entities based on a business process flow .

# # Create an approval request flow
In our next topic , we ’ ll see what it looks like when an approver receives a new request for a proposed tweet .
# Classic Common Data Service workflows
Workflows automate business processes without a user interface . People usually use workflow processes to initiate automation that doesn ’ t require any user interaction .
Each workflow process is associated with a single entity . When configuring workflows you have four major areas to consider :
- When to start them ?
- Should they run as a real-time workflow or a background workflow ?
- What actions should they perform ?
- Under what conditions should actions be performed ?
# # Where do you customize workflow processes ?
Depending on how the app is built , users can create or modify their workflows in the app .
When you create a workflow the * * Create Process * * dialog requires that you set three properties that all processes have :
This property establishes that this is a workflow process .
Each workflow process must be set to a single entity . You can ’ t change the entity after the workflow process is created .
After you create the Workflow or if you edit an existing one , you will have the following additional properties :
Process templates are convenient when you have a number of similar workflow processes and want to define them without duplicating the same logic .
This section contains options that describe how the workflow is available to be run .
Choose this option if you want to allow users to run this workflow from the * * Run Workflow * * command .
Choose this option if you want to allow the workflow to be available to be started from another workflow .
This section contains an option to delete a workflow after the workflow execution has completed .
Choose this option , if you want a completed workflow job to be automatically deleted .
&gt; The workflow jobs are not deleted immediately upon completion , but soon after , through a batch process .
# # Security context of workflow processes
When a background workflow starts based on an event the workflow operates in the context of the person who owns it , usually the person who created the workflow .
Workflows are saved when they are activated , so it is not necessary to save them before activating them .
&#91; Add an on-demand workflow to a business process flow &#93; ( bpf-add-on-demand-workflow.md )
# # List of UI flows
From this section , you can create a new UI flow and edit or delete your existing UI flows .
For each of your UI flows , you can see its details by selecting its name from the list of UI flows . You then see details including :
- The run history with details of each run .
- The applications or Websites used in the UI flow .
Follow these steps to see the details for a UI flow :
1 . Select any of your UI flows .
# # Connect Power Automate Services
You should see your new Twitter connection and any other connections you have created .
The first thing you need to do is create a new SharePoint Online list for Contoso Flooring .
Your list is built , so now you can build the flow .
# # # Choose a trigger
We want our trigger to fire when a new row is added with tweet content .
Okay , that ’ s it for the trigger .
# # # Add an action to delay posting
3 . Set the delay value .
# # # Add an action to post a Tweet
Now you &apos;ll add another action for the flow to take at the date and time specified in the * * Tweet Date * * column .
Now the flow is complete .
# # Create a scheduled flow
7 . Add a new action .
Notice that the flow automatically creates an additional step . Flow detects that you are going to set an action that requires an additional action . Whenever the flow reads a new email address , it will also create a new action for each row .
Now this flow will run once a day and get new rows from this Excel table , grab the email address and name , and use them to populate the MailChimp Contoso mail list , saving you both time and money .
# Learn all about data groups
# # What is a data group ?
# # How data is shared between data groups
# # Add services to a data group
4 . Notice that both SharePoint and Salesforce are now in the business data only group :
Since all services must be in one of the available data groups , to remove a service from a specific group , simply add the service to another group then save the policy .
# # Change the default data group
4 . Notice the data group is now designated as the default data group :

Organizations need insights into how apps are used and who &apos;s using them . The Admin analytics sharing and connectors reports provide insight into how Power Automate is being used within your tenant .
From a sharing perspective , you can learn who your app champions are and then empower them to provide even more automated solutions for your organization . The connectors report identifies Microsoft , third-party , and custom connectors that are in use within your organization .
The results in these reports are based on the environment you &apos;ve selected . To change the environment :

# Replace dialogs with business process flows or canvas apps
This table lists the set of dialog capabilities and the equivalent capabilities in business process flows and canvas apps .
&#124; Start using a URL &#124; No &#124; Yes &#124;
# # # Additional capabilities with business process flows
- Process analytics ( views , charts , and time spent in a stage )
# # # Additional capabilities with canvas apps
- App analytics ( app usage &amp; performance )
- Multi-entity page composition
- Run flows
- Launch as a stand-alone app
- Configurable layout
# # Choosing between a business process flow or canvas app
When you choose your dialog replacement , it is important to account for the user experience you want to deliver . Also keep in mind , almost any dialog can be modeled using a canvas app .
Business process flows are best suited to replace dialogs that model processes providing guidance across an overarching workstream that requires collaboration across groups of individuals and Dynamics 365 app context . For example , quote review and routing .
# # Dialog replacement using business process flow scenario
To make this business process flow available to users , ensure the right users have privileges to the business process flow and then activate it .
# # Dialog replacement using canvas app scenario
Suppose you have a dialog , which follows a call script that guides sales reps through cold calling leads . This process can easily be captured using a canvas app .
Begin by identifying the number of screens needed . For this example , you may decide to have five screens .
- Screen 1 . To select a lead from a list to call .
- Screen 4 . To capture next steps and schedule follow-up calls .
To make this app available to users , publish the app . Consider how such a scenario might be transformed through the availability of a standalone app that provides call scripts and supports quick data entry .
Are dependencies on canvas apps be tracked ?
- Dependencies on canvas apps are tracked in the same way as dependencies in Dynamics 365 apps .
Can workflows be called from a canvas app ?
Can I automatically convert dialogs to business process flows or canvas apps ?
- There is no automated way to convert dialogs to business process flows or canvas apps .
These resources contain personal data that are automatically deleted when a user closes an MSA :
&#124; Resources containing personal data &#124;
&#124; Product and service activity &#124;
These steps describe how to self-serve Account Close requests for GDPR .
&gt; You &apos;re reminded to cancel existing subscriptions or to export data from existing services to which you may have subscribed .
A notification appears , indicating that your account will be closed in 30 days . You may reopen this account at any time during this 30-day period .
At the end of this 30-day window , the process to delete all Power Automate resources for this MSA begins .
title : Call Child Flows
You can use child flows to easily manage flows , avoiding flows with hundreds of steps . This approach is especially beneficial if you want to reuse tasks in multiple places in a flow , or even across multiple flows .
Let &apos;s look at an example where you have a child flow that you want to create or update a contact in Common Data Service based on that contact &apos;s name .
You will need a solution with two flows :
# # Create the child flow in a solution
Alternatively , you can create a solution .
The input you define here will be passed in to the child flow from the parent flow .
1 . Build the logic that you want the child flow to run . This logic can contain as many steps as you need .
After your steps , you need to return data to the parent flow . In this case you can use one of two actions :
1 . Give your flow a descriptive name and then save it .
You need to then test your child flow . Because you can manually trigger this flow , it &apos;s very easy to test right inside of the designer . Try it out with a couple different inputs , and verify that the outputs are what you expect .
# # Create the parent flow in a solution
1 . Build the parent flow in the same solution in which you created the child flow .
Alternatively , you can bring an existing flow into that solution . The parent flow can have any type of trigger .
1 . Pick the child flow that you created earlier .
&gt; You will only see the flows to which you have access and are located in a solution . Child flows must also have one of the three triggers mentioned earlier .
&gt; When you export the solution that contains these two flows and import it into another environment , the new parent and child flows will be automatically linked , so there &apos;s no need to update URLs .
# Create an automated flow by using Common Data Service
You can use any of the following triggers to initiate your flow :
- When a record is selected
- When a record is created
- When a record is deleted
- When a record is updated
You can use scopes to determine if your flow runs if you create a new record , if a new record is created by a user within your business unit , or if a new record is created by any user in your organization .
&#124; Scope &#124; Trigger timing &#124;
&#124; Business Unit &#124; Action is taken on a record owned by your business unit &#124;
&#124; Organization &#124; Action is taken by anyone within the organization or database &#124;
&#124; Parent : Child business unit &#124; Action is taken on a record owned by your business unit or a child business unit &#124;
Triggers that run when a record is updated can also use filtering attributes . This ensures that the flow only runs when any of the defined attributes are updated .
&gt; Use filter attributes to prevent your flow from unnecessarily running .
This flow triggers any time the first or last name of contact that the flow user owns is updated .
Use any of the following actions to write data into Common Data Service :
- Create a new record
- Update a record
Here &apos;s an example of creating a follow-up task when the given user creates a new account record .
To write data into customer , owner , and regarding fields , two fields must be populated .
&#124; Field category &#124; Example settings &#124;
&#124; Customer &#124; Represents the ID of the record and the customer type as selected from the list . &#124;
&#124; Owner &#124; Represents the ID of the system user or team , and owner type as selected from the list . &#124;
# # # Enable upsert behavior
Flow runs may be delayed if there is a backlog of system jobs in your environment . If this delay occurs , your flow is triggered when the system job to invoke the flow runs .
Create a vacation request in the SharePoint Online list you created earlier .
After you save this request , the flow triggers , and then :
1 . Creates a request in the approvals center .
2 . Sends an approval request email to the approvers .
title : Approve requests on a mobile device &#124; Microsoft Docs
# Approve requests on your mobile device by using Power Automate
This article walks you through a few common scenarios that you ’ re likely to encounter while you manage approval requests in the mobile app for Power Automate .
&gt; The images in this topic are from an Android device ; however , the experience on iOS is similar .
To complete this walkthrough , you need :
* To be designated as the approver in an approval flow .
* Pending requests for approval .
3 . View all pending approvals :
# # Approve requests and leave an optional comment
Enter a comment on the * * Add comment * * screen .
The success screen displays after the flow records your decision .
# # Reject requests and leave an optional comment
# # Sources and destinations , triggers and actions
Now let &apos;s learn how to post tweets based on data in a SharePoint list .
# Responding to GDPR Data Subject Export Requests for Power Automate
Either an end user or an administrator , who has granted themselves access to the flow , can export the flow by following these steps :
The run history is downloaded as a .csv file so that you can open it in Microsoft Excel or a text editor and further analyze the results .
# # Export a user &apos;s activity feed
# # Export a user ’ s connections
Connections allow flows to connect to APIs , SaaS applications , and other third-party systems . Follow these steps to view your connections :
Power Apps Admin PowerShell cmdlets
# # Export a user ’ s custom connectors
Custom connectors supplement the out of box connectors and allow for connectivity to other APIs , SaaS , and custom-developed systems . You can transfer ownership of a custom connector or delete it .
Follow these steps to export a list of customer connectors :
1 . Copy and paste the list of custom connectors into a text editor such as Microsoft Word .
# # Export a user ’ s custom connector permissions
Power Automate Approvals History captures a historical record of approvals that have been received or sent for a user . Any user can view their approval history by :
The first step in responding to a DSR request is to find the personal data that ’ s the subject of the request .
title : &quot; Create a custom action &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
Like workflow processes , actions have the following properties in the * * Create Process * * dialog box .
After you enter a name for the process , a unique name will be created for it by removing any spaces or special characters from the process name .
This property establishes that this is an action process . You can ’ t change this after you save the process .
Use this property to choose whether to build a new action from scratch or to start from an existing template .
Unlike workflow processes , you don ’ t need to set the following options :
Actions also have something that workflow processes don ’ t – input and output arguments .
You must deactivate processes before you can edit them .
You can edit an action that was created as part of an unmanaged solution or included in a solution installed in your organization . If the solution is a managed solution , you might not be able to edit it . The solution publisher has the option to edit the managed properties so that the action installed with a managed solution can ’ t be edited .
When an action is saved , a unique name is generated based on the process name . This unique name has the customization prefix added from the solution publisher . This is the name of the message that a developer will use in their code .
When editing an action you have the following options :
After the process is created and the unique name is generated from the process name , you can edit the process name . You might want to apply a naming convention to make it easier to locate specific processes .
&gt; You can ’ t enable rollback if a custom action is invoked directly from within a workflow . You can enable rollback if an action is triggered by a Power Apps web services message .
Like all processes , you can activate the process as a template and use it as an advanced starting point for processes that follow a similar pattern .
* * Add Stages and steps * *
When the message is finished , the developer may need to pass some data that was changed or generated by the message to another operation in their code . This data is the output argument .
Both input and output arguments must have a name , a type , and some information about whether the argument is always required . You can also provide a description .
You can change the order of the arguments by sorting them or moving them up or down because the arguments are identified by name , not by the order . Also , changing the description won ’ t break code using the message .
# # # Action process argument types
The following table describes the action process argument types .
&#124; Boolean &#124; A `true` or `false` value . &#124;
&#124; DateTime &#124; A value that stores date and time information . &#124;
&#124; Decimal &#124; A number value with decimal precision . Used when precision is extremely important . &#124;
&#124; Float &#124; A number value with decimal precision . Used when data comes from a measurement that isn ’ t absolutely precise . &#124;
&#124; Money &#124; A value that stores data about an amount of money . &#124;
&#124; Picklist &#124; A value that represents an option for an OptionSet attribute . &#124;

# Responding to GDPR Data Subject Delete Requests for Power Automate
The following table shows which personal data is automatically deleted and which data requires an administrator to manually review and delete :
&#124; User details &#124; Gateway permissions &#124;
* Each of these resources contains “ Created By ” and “ Modified By ” records that include personal data . For security reasons , these records are retained until the resource is deleted .
Here is the breakdown of experiences that are available for an administrator to delete each types of personal data within each type of resource :

&#124; Activity feed &#124; &#124; &#124; Deleted through 28 day retention policy &#124;
The steps below describe how administrative functions exist to serve delete requests for GDPR . These steps should be performed in the order outlined below .
&gt; To avoid data corruption , follow these steps in order .
1 . The copy now performs the same workflow logic as the original version .
# # Delete approval history from Power Automate
# # Delete connections created by a user
Connections are used in conjunction with connectors to establish connectivity with other APIs and SaaS systems . Connections include references to the user who created them and as a result , can be deleted to remove any references to the user .
Power Apps Maker PowerShell cmdlets
# # Delete the user ’ s permissions to shared connections
&gt; Owner role assignments cannot be deleted without deleting the connection resource .
# # Delete custom connectors created by the user
# # Delete the user ’ s permissions to shared custom connectors
# # Delete or reassign all environments created by the user
As an admin you have two decisions to make when processing a DSR delete request for a user for each of the environments that has been created by the user :
1 . If you determine that the environment is not being used by anyone else in your organization then you can choose to delete the environment
# # Give access to a user ’ s environments from the Power Automate Admin Center
# # Delete the user from Azure Active Directory
# # Delete the user from Unmanaged Tenant
To determine whether or not you are a user of a managed or unmanaged tenant , perform the following actions :
1 . Otherwise , you belong to a managed tenant .
# Create flows from the OneDrive for Business launch panel
This feature enables the person running the flow to use their own credentials , which is especially applicable for flows that have been created by an IT department .
1 . Find , and then select the file for which you want to create the flow .
1 . Select one of the templates .
In this example , select the * * Request my manager &apos;s approval for the selected file * * template .
&gt; Sign into any connectors that requests that you sign in .
1 . Make any changes you want to the template and then save your flow with a name that you &apos;ll remember easily .
1 . Find , and then select the file on which request manager approval .
1 . Select the flow you created earlier .
&gt; While this walkthrough shows how to create a flow from a template , you can also create a flow from blank to use any of the hundreds of connectors available in Power Automate .
1 . Select the * * Value * * box , and then enter * * Approve * * into the box .

title : Create a flow from your phone &#124; Microsoft Docs
# Create a flow from your phone by using Power Automate
Create a flow from your phone by using a template , which you can find by searching through a list of services , browsing categories , or specifying keywords . Follow the steps in this topic to create a flow that sends a push notification to your phone when you get mail from your manager .
* To use the template demonstrated in this topic , you &apos;ll also need :
* Push notifications enabled on your phone .
You can find a template in any of these ways :
* Specify a keyword in the search box at the top of the screen .
* Scroll down to show a variety of categories , and then tap a template in any category .
For this tutorial , you &apos;ll open the template that sends a push notification when you get mail from your manager .
You can use the same connections when you create other flows .
The next screen shows the trigger event and all of the resulting actions .
Your flow is created and will check for mail from your manager until you pause or delete the flow .
title : Monitor activity from your phone &#124; Microsoft Docs
# Monitor activity in Power Automate from your phone
The flow in this tutorial runs when you receive mail from a specific address :
When the flow runs , it sends a custom push notification , with this syntax , to your phone :
# # Display a summary of activity
1 . If your flow hasn &apos;t run before , trigger a run to generate data .
It might take some time for the data to appear in the app .
This tab organizes data by day , with today &apos;s data at the top .
Each entry shows the name of a flow with icons that correspond to its trigger events and actions .
If at least one run of a flow has succeeded in a day , an entry shows the number of successes and the time when it succeeded most recently . A different entry shows similar information if a flow has failed .
If a flow sends a push notification , the text of the most recent notification appears at the bottom of the entry for successful runs .
5 . To filter the activity summary , tap the icon in the upper-right corner .
You can show all entries , only the failure entries , or only the entries that include push notifications .
# # Show details of a run
Each event and action appears with an icon that indicates whether the event or action succeeded or failed . If it succeeded , the amount of time it took ( in seconds ) also appears .
title : Manage flows from your phone &#124; Microsoft Docs
# Manage flows in Power Automate from your phone
Each entry shows the name of the flow , icons for its events and actions , the time when it ran most recently , and an icon that indicates whether the most recent run succeeded .
2 . Tap a flow to show options for managing it .
title : Learn to connect to your data using connections and on-premises data gateways &#124; Microsoft Docs
# Manage connections in Power Automate
For example , you can use a connection to perform these tasks :
* Update a SharePoint list .
You can create a connection in multiple scenarios , such as these :
&#91; ! INCLUDE &#91; sharepoint-detailed-docs &#93; ( includes / sharepoint-detailed-docs.md ) &#93;
# # Connect to your data through an on-premises data gateway
1 . Follow the steps earlier in this topic to add a connection .
&gt; Microsoft SharePoint data gateways support HTTP traffic but not HTTPS traffic .
3 . Provide the connection &apos;s credentials , and then select the gateway that you want to use .
You can update a connection that isn &apos;t working because your account details or your password changed .
2 . When prompted , update your connection with new credentials .
title : Learn how to export solution-aware flows &#124; Microsoft Docs
Follow these steps to move your solution and its dependencies to a new environment :
1 . Save the solution with a name of your choice .
In a previous topic , you saw how to build an approval process around tweets that are stored in a SharePoint list . In this topic , you &apos;ll see what the experience looks like when an approver receives a new approval request .
# # Create and process a request
First we need to add an item to our SharePoint list , then we can process an approval request for that item .
In this topic , you saw the experience from the approver ’ s point of view - from receiving an approval request email , to processing the request in the Approval Center .
The first thing you &apos;ll need is a trigger . The button flow is a convenient one to use .
When the button is pressed , an email is sent to the whole Contoso Warehouse team , no matter where they are in the building , letting them know that the delivery has arrived .
# # Create a team flow
2 . Enter names , email addresses , or user groups to add co-owners .
3 . To remove co-owners , select the trash can to the right of their name .
In this lesson , you &apos;ve seen how to * * create a button flow * * .
The worker then shared that button out to the team , so others could trigger the same flow if that person wasn ’ t around .
Check out the next lesson to see how to create a flow that uses * * push notifications * * .
# Overview of Adaptive Cards for Microsoft Teams
Since Adaptive Cards adapt to their host , they are perfect vehicles for sharing information between Microsoft Teams and other services .
# # Currently available actions for flows
- * * Post an adaptive card as the Flow bot to a Teams user , and wait for a response * *
This action posts an adaptive card as a Flow bot to a specific Teams channel . In this case , you will be prompted for Teams instance , and a channel where the card will be posted . The flow-maker will have to have access to the Teams instance in order to post an adaptive card there . In this case , only URL buttons function by redirecting to the URL configured within the flow .
&gt; When you use this card , the flow waits for a response from any Teams member .
- Only the information within the ‘ Update message ’ input box ( see image 3 ) will be shown on the replacement card after consumers submit the card .
&gt; This content will be updated to reflect the branding change in the coming days .
# Use expressions in conditions to check multiple values
You can use any combination of the following logical expressions in your conditions .
Here &apos;s an example of what the spreadsheet might look like :
Let &apos;s create the flow .
# # # Add a trigger to your flow
2 . Set the schedule to run once daily .
# # # Select the spreadsheet and get all rows
# # # Check the status column of each row
The * * or * * expression appears as shown here :
Your * * Condition * * card resembles this image :
# # # Delete matching rows from the spreadsheet
# # # Name the flow and save it
# # # Run the flow with the or expression
The flow runs after you save it . If you created the spreadsheet shown earlier in this walkthrough , here &apos;s what the it looks like after the run completes :
Notice all data from rows that had &quot; completed &quot; or &quot; unnecessary &quot; in the Status column were deleted .
# # Use the and expression
# # # Run the flow with the and expression
After your flow runs , your spreadsheet resembles this image :
# # Use the empty expression
Notice extra lines are removed from the table .
# # Use the greater expression
Imagine you &apos;ve bought baseball tickets for your coworkers and you &apos;re using a spreadsheet to ensure you &apos;re reimbursed by each person . You can quickly create a flow that sends a daily email to each person who hasn &apos;t paid the full amount .
Here &apos;s a view of the spreadsheet :
Here &apos;s the implementation of the * * greater * * expression that identifies all persons who have paid less than the amount due from them :
# # Use the less expression
Imagine you &apos;ve bought baseball tickets for your coworkers , and you &apos;re using a spreadsheet to ensure you &apos;re reimbursed by each person by the date to which everyone agreed . You can create a flow that sends a reminder email to each person who hasn &apos;t paid the full amount if the current date is less than one day before the due date .
&#124; Condition to validate &#124; expression to use &#124; Example &#124;
# # Combine the greater and less expressions in an and expression
Here &apos;s a view of the spreadsheet table :
Here &apos;s the implementation of the * * and * * expression that identifies all persons who have paid less than the amount due from them and the due date is less than one day away from the current date :

# # Use the join action
Here , I ’ ve used the semicolon ( ; ) as the new delimiter .
3 . Save your flow , and then run it .
# # Use the select action
&gt; While you can add or remove elements using the select action , you cannot change the number of objects in the array .
and you ’ d like to reshape the incoming data by renaming &quot; first &quot; to &quot; FirstName &quot; , &quot; last &quot; to &quot; LastName &quot; and adding a new member named &quot; FamilyName &quot; that combines &quot; first &quot; and &quot; last &quot; ( separated with a space ) :
To do this :
# # Use the filter array action
&gt; Filter array cannot be used to change the shape of the objects in an array . Also , the text on which you filter is case sensitive .
For example , you can use filter array on this array :
to create a new array that contains only objects in which * first * is set to “ Deon ” .
Let &apos;s do this .
2 . Configure the filter array action like the following image .
3 . Save , and then run your flow .
4 . When your flow runs , assuming the JSON input looks like this array :
# # Use the create csv table action
2 . Save , and then run your flow .
# # Use the create html table action

The flows you create can trigger when a Common Data Service record is created , updated , or deleted .
After you select a trigger , you &apos;ll need to configure :
- A condition for the trigger .
- The name of the entity .
- The scope for the trigger .
You can add any of these conditions to determine precisely when your flow is triggered .
# # # The entity name
Select any of the numerous entities that are available to indicate the entity on which your trigger operates .
Use scopes to determine if your flow runs when you , someone in your business unit , or any user in your organization creates a record .
Here are the details on each scope .
&gt; If you have two updates that happen within seconds of each other , the flow may be triggered more than once with the latest versioned content .
Flow runs may be delayed if there is a backlog of system jobs in your environment . If this delay occurs , your flow is triggered when the system job to start the flow runs .

* Connections to Office , Outlook , and the push notification service
# # Trigger a flow based on an email &apos;s subject
In this walkthrough , we create a flow that sends a push notification to your mobile phone if the subject of any new email has the word &quot; lottery &quot; in it . Your flow then marks any such email as * read * .
Ok , let &apos;s get started :
In this example , we &apos;re interested in any email that has the word &quot; lottery &quot; in the subject .
Congratulations ! You now receive a push notification each time you receive an email that contains the word &quot; lottery &quot; in the subject .
# # Trigger a flow based on an email &apos;s sender
Your flow takes action on any emails that are sent from this address .
1 . Enter the details for the mobile notification you &apos;d like to receive whenever a message arrives from the email address that you entered earlier .
# # Trigger a flow when emails arrive in a specific folder
If you have rules that route email to different folders based on certain properties , such as the address , you may want this type of flow .
&gt; If you don &apos;t already have a rule that routes email to a folder other than your inbox , create such a rule and confirm it works by sending a test email .
Test the flow by sending an email that gets routed to the folder you selected earlier in this walkthrough .

title : Use inputs and outputs in desktop UI flows &#124; Microsoft Docs
# Use inputs and outputs in desktop UI flows
Use inputs to pass information from an external source such as a database or any supported connector to the legacy software that UI flows automates .
# # Define inputs in the UI flows
1 . Add a name , a sample data , and a description to your input .
- Sample data is used during the recording or test .
- The description will be helpful to differentiate the inputs that you have created .
- For sensitive text inputs , the sample value will be obscured and will not be persisted after saving
1 . Once your inputs are created , you can click on next to use them in a recording .
# # Use inputs to pass information to the application
1 . In the list , you can choose between three options :
&gt; You can identify sensitive text inputs easily because they have a different icon from text inputs .
In example that follows , you will see that “ Invoice Account ” is used as the value .
&gt; If you also used a sensitive text input , you would see an action with a lock icon on the top right to indicate that you used sensitive text input .
1 . When triggering your UI flow , you can change the input value at will .
# # Use outputs to extract information from the app
For example , you can extract customer information your legacy accounting software and add it to a SharePoint list .
Outputs can only be created as you record your UI flow .
1 . Provide a name and a description for the output .
Your output is now available in the dedicated area of the wizard .
Each output has :
- An output name as defined during the recording .
- A description : This field can be very useful when you define many outputs during a recording and want to easily identify them later .
- An action name : the action in which the output is defined in your UI flow .
# # Use clipboard content to define outputs
During a recording , it is possible to copy a text in the clipboard of your computer and to define it as output of your UI flow .
1 . During your recording , copy a string value
# # Delete an output from a UI flow
If you do not need an output anymore , delete it by going to the associated action and removing the Output name in the dynamic value .
# # Test your UI flow
Testing UI flows lets you validate your changes and the appropriate playback behavior .
&gt; For any sensitive text inputs that are created in the recorder , the sample value will need to be specified again before testing .
1 . Once playback completes , you see the run status of your UI flow :
- For each action , a status indicator that shows that the test worked well , along with the associated inputs .
- You will also see the value of the outputs obtained for this test at the bottom of the designer .
- If an error occurs , you &apos;ll see which step caused the problem along with a screenshot at the moment the error occurred .
# Find and fix errors with Flow Checker
Flow Checker in Power Automate promotes higher quality flows by ensuring you follow best practices when you design flows . When you run the checker , you get insights into questions like &quot; which areas of my flow &apos;s implementation pose a performance or reliability risk ? &quot;
For each issue the checker identifies , the checker points to specific occurrences within the flow where you should consider making improvements . And , you learn how to implement these improvements by following detailed guidance .
The checker is always active , appearing in the command bar in the designer . The checker shows a red dot when it finds one or more errors , potential errors , or warnings in your flow .
# # View errors or warnings in the checker
The checker also opens automatically when you save the flow if there are errors or warnings . Once the checker opens , it shows all errors and warnings in your flow . In each section , the checker calls out the actions where the error or warning occurs .
# # Learn to fix errors and warnings
Expand each section to learn more about how to fix the errors or warnings .

Follow these steps to distribute your traffic across your gateways :
1 . Select any of your gateways .
# Power Automate mobile app supports Microsoft Intune
# # Why Intune support is important
Organizations are looking for more control over the data that resides on employee mobile devices . Organizations might want to restrict how that data moves to the device and ensure the data is removed , should the employee leave the organization .
For the Power Automate mobile app to be managed , you must :
1 . Create an app protection policy .
1 . Assign the Power Automate mobile app to the app protection policy .
1 . Add all users to which the app protection policy applies to the Azure AD group .
# # Test the app protection policy
After you &apos;ve created the app protection policy and assigned users to the Azure AD group , it &apos;s time to use the Power Automate mobile app and confirm the policy works .
To confirm the policy works , follow these steps :
1 . Install the Power Automate mobile app on a device whose platform matches one of the platforms you defined in the app protection policy .
1 . Sign in to the mobile app with an account that &apos;s in the Azure AD group that restricts use of the mobile app to users who have a PIN .
You &apos;ll then be prompted to :
1 . Install the Company Portal .
1 . Set your PIN if you don &apos;t already have a PIN that meets the app protection policy &apos;s criteria .
# # What is an environment :
# # Purposes for an environment
You can use environments to :
* Separate apps , flows and business data based on different roles , security requirements or users .
* Separate apps , flows and business data based on the location of your teams or departments .
* Manage test and production environments .
# # How to use environments
Environments can serve several different purposes , depending on your organizational needs , some examples are :
* You can choose to build all your apps and flows in a single environment .
# # What are roles ?
2 . Select a region where your environment will be hosted .
4 . Optionally select who will have access to the database . You can either restrict access or give everyone access to the database .
# # Add users to an environment
After you create an environment , you can add users to either the Environment Admin role or the Environment Maker role . As with all other administrative tasks , you do this from the admin center .
You &apos;ll learn about :
* The features that environments provide .
* Switching between environments .
* How to create a flow in the right environment .
# # Here are a few scenarios for using environments
Here &apos;s an example .
Follow these steps to switch environments :
1 . In the top right corner , you see an image that represents your profile .

# Tutorial : Create calculated columns in Power BI Desktop
This tutorial will guide you through understanding and creating some calculated columns and using them in report visualizations in Power BI Desktop .
# # Create a calculated column with values from related tables
An opening parenthesis appears , along with another suggestion list of the related columns you can pass to the RELATED function , with descriptions and details of expected parameters .
# # Use your new column in a report
# # Create a calculated column that uses an IF function
# # What you &apos;ve learned
# # Download the report as a .pbix file
To download the .pbix file , follow these steps :
There are a few important considerations and limitations associated with downloading a .pbix file from the Power BI service .
* To download the file , you must have edit access to the report .
* Reports must be published or updated after November 23 , 2016 . Reports published earlier aren &apos;t downloadable .
* This feature won &apos;t work with reports and content packs originally created in the Power BI service .
* If your administrator has turned off the ability to download data , this feature won &apos;t be visible in the Power BI service .
* Datasets with incremental refresh can &apos;t be downloaded to a .pbix file .
Here are some additional articles that can help you learn to use the Power BI service :
After you &apos;ve installed Power BI Desktop , see the following article to help you get up and running quickly :
# Organizational content packs : Copy , refresh , and get access
# # Create a copy of an organizational content pack
Create your own copy of the content pack , not visible to others .
Now you have a copy that you can change . Nobody else will see changes you make .
# # Help ! I can no longer access the content pack
This can happen for several reasons :
# # How are organizational content packs refreshed ?
When the content pack is created , the refresh settings are inherited with the dataset . When you create a copy of the content pack , the new version retains its link to the original dataset and its refresh schedule .

# Query folding guidance in Power BI Desktop
Query folding guidance differs based on the model mode .
The following bulleted-list provides specific guidance .
For a relational data source , if the step that prevents query folding could be achieved in a single SELECT statement — or within the procedural logic of a stored procedure — consider using a native SQL query , as described next .
- Incremental refresh can &apos;t use a native SQL query . So , it would force the Power Query mashup engine to retrieve all source rows , and then apply filters to determine incremental changes .

title : Many-to-many relationship guidance
There are , in fact , three many-to-many scenarios . They can occur when you &apos;re required to :
Here &apos;s a simplistic model diagram of the three tables .
To help describe how the relationship filter propagation works , the model diagram has been modified to reveal the table rows .
The row details for the four tables are described in the following bulleted list :
Let &apos;s see what happens when the model is queried .
- Account-01 balance amount is 75
- Account-02 balance amount is 200
- The total is 275
- Customer-92 balance amount is 275
As expected , there has been no change to the * * Account Balance * * visual .
The * * Customer Balance * * visuals , however , now displays the following result :
- Customer-91 balance amount is 75
The answer to their question lies in understanding the many-to-many relationship . Each customer balance can represent the addition of multiple account balances , and so the customer balances are _ non-additive _ .
# # # Relate many-to-many dimensions guidance
When you have a many-to-many relationship between dimension-type tables , we provide the following guidance :
- Add each many-to-many related entity as a model table , ensuring it has a unique identifier ( ID ) column
- Add a bridging table to store associated entities
- Create one-to-many relationships between the three tables
- Configure * * one * * bi-directional relationship to allow filter propagation to continue to the fact-type tables
- Hide the bridging table ( unless it contains additional columns or measures required for reporting )
- If it makes sense to leave an ID column visible , ensure that it &apos;s on the &quot; one &quot; slide of the relationship — always hide the &quot; many &quot; side column . It results in the best filter performance .
The row details for the two tables are described in the following bulleted list :
# # # Relate many-to-many facts guidance
Let &apos;s consider a better solution .
Notice the following design changes :
- The four additional tables are all dimension-type tables , and one-to-many relationships relate these tables to the fact-type tables
- All unique identifier columns are hidden
- Your report visuals can _ filter or group _ by any visible column from the dimension-type tables
# # Relate higher grain facts
This many-to-many scenario is very different from the other two already described in this article .
# # # Relate higher grain time periods
Care must be taken , however , to ensure that month or date level filters produce a meaningful result . Without any special calculation logic , report visuals may report that target dates are literally the first day of each year . All other days — and all months except January — will summarize the target quantity as BLANK .
To avoid this behavior , we recommend you control the summarization of your fact data by using measures . One way to control the summarization is to return BLANK when lower-level time periods are queried . Another way — defined with some sophisticated DAX — is to apportion values across lower-level time periods .
# # # Relate higher grain ( non-date )
A different design approach is required when relating a non-date column from a dimension-type table to a fact-type table ( and it &apos;s at a higher grain than the dimension-type table ) .
Let &apos;s now take a look at the table rows .
The visual produces a misrepresentation of the data . What is happening here ?
To avoid this behavior , as described earlier , we recommend you control the summarization of your fact data by using measures .
The final model design looks like the following .
# # # Relate higher grain facts guidance
When you need to relate a dimension-type table to a fact-type table , and the fact-type table stores rows at a higher grain than the dimension-type table rows , we provide the following guidance :
- For higher grain fact dates :
- In the fact-type table , store the first date of the time period
- Create a one-to-many relationship between the date table and the fact-type table
- For other higher grain facts :
- Create a many-to-many relationship between the dimension-type table and the fact-type table
- Hide summarizable fact-type table columns — this way , only measures can be used to summarize the fact-type table

# # Creating and managing capacities
When creating a Premium capacity , administrators are required to define :
- Capacity name ( unique within the tenant ) .
At least one Capacity Admin must be assigned . Users assigned as Capacity Admins can :
- Assign workspaces to the capacity .
- Manage user permissions , to add additional Capacity Admins or users with assignment permissions ( to enable them to assign workspaces to the capacity ) .
- Manage workloads , to configure maximum memory usage for paginated reports and dataflows workloads .
- Restart the capacity , to reset all operations because of a system overload .
Power BI service administrators and Global Administrators can modify Premium capacities . Specifically , they can :
- Change the capacity size to scale-up or scale-down resources .
- Add or remove Capacity Admins .
- Add or remove additional workloads .
- Change regions .
Assignment permissions are required to assign a workspace to a specific Premium capacity . The permissions can be granted to the entire organization , specific users , or groups .
Deleting a Premium capacity is possible and won &apos;t result in the deletion of its workspaces and content . Instead , it moves any assigned workspaces to shared capacity . When the Premium capacity was created in a different region , the workspace is moved to shared capacity of the home region .
# # # Assigning workspaces to capacities
A workspace can be added to a Premium capacity by using the * * Workspace * * pane providing the user is both a workspace admin and has assignment permissions .
In the Power BI service , a workspace assigned to a Premium capacity is easily identified by the diamond icon that adorns the workspace name .
# # # Power BI Admin portal
At the capacity level , metrics are cumulative of all enabled workloads. the following metrics are provided :
# # # Power BI Premium Capacity Metrics app
When the app opens , the dashboard is loaded to present numerous tiles expressing an aggregated view over all capacities of which the user is a Capacity Admin . The dashboard layout includes five main sections :
The underlying report , from which the dashboard tiles were pinned , can be accessed by clicking on any dashboard tile . It provides a more detailed perspective of each of the dashboard sections and supports interactive filtering .
Metrics should be monitored to establish a baseline understanding of resource usage and workload activity . If the capacity becomes slow , it is important to understand which metrics to monitor , and the conclusions you can make .
Ideally , queries should complete within a second to deliver responsive experiences to report users and enable higher query throughput . It is usually of lesser concern when background processes - including refreshes - take longer times to complete .
- Model load times ( especially the wait to load a large model into memory ) .
- Long running queries .
- Too many LC \ DQ connections ( exceeding capacity limits ) .
- Complex report designs with an excessive number of visuals on a page ( recall that each visual is a query ) .

# Model relationships in Power BI Desktop
Put simply , Power BI relationships propagate filters applied on the columns of model tables to other model tables . Filters will propagate so long as there &apos;s a relationship path to follow , which can involve propagation to multiple tables .
Let &apos;s see how relationships propagate filters with an animated example .
Each model relationship must be defined with a cardinality type . There are four cardinality type options , representing the data characteristics of the &quot; from &quot; and &quot; to &quot; related columns . The &quot; one &quot; side means the column contains unique values ; the &quot; two &quot; side means the column can contain duplicate values .
&gt; If a data refresh operation attempts to load duplicate values into a &quot; one &quot; side column , the entire data refresh will fail .
The four options — together with their shorthand notations — are described in the following bulleted list :
# # # Cross filter direction
&#124; Cardinality type &#124; Cross filter options &#124;
# # # Make this relationship active
# # # Assume referential integrity
Always enable this property when a database foreign key constraint exists between the two tables . When a foreign key constraint doesn &apos;t exist , you can still enable the property as long as you &apos;re certain data integrity exists .
There are several DAX functions that are relevant to model relationships . Each function is described briefly in the following bulleted list :
First , some modeling theory is required to fully understand relationship evaluations .
An Import or DirectQuery model sources all of its data from either the Vertipaq cache or the source database . In both instances , Power BI is able to determine that a &quot; one &quot; side of a relationship exists .
Let &apos;s see an example of a Composite model .
&gt; Inactive relationships are expanded also , even when the relationship isn &apos;t used by a calculation . Bi-directional relationships have no impact on table expansion .
For One-to-many relationships , table expansion takes place from the &quot; many &quot; to the &quot; one &quot; sides by using LEFT OUTER JOIN semantics . When a matching value from the &quot; many &quot; to the &quot; one &quot; side doesn &apos;t exist , a blank virtual row is added to the &quot; one &quot; side table .
Let &apos;s see how table expansion works with an animated example .
A model relationship is _ weak _ when there &apos;s no guaranteed &quot; one &quot; side . It can be the case for two reasons :
- The relationship uses a Many-to-many cardinality type ( even if one or both columns contain unique values )
- The relationship is cross-island ( which can only ever be the case for Composite models )
For Import models , data structures are never created for weak relationships . This means table joins must be resolved at query time .
There are additional restrictions related to weak relationships :
- The RELATED DAX function can &apos;t be used to retrieve the &quot; one &quot; side column values
- Enforcing RLS has topology restrictions
Bi-directional relationships can introduce multiple — and therefore ambiguous — filter propagation paths between model tables . The following list presents precedence rules that Power BI uses for ambiguity detection and path resolution :
3 . Bi-directional relationships , in the reverse direction ( that is , from the &quot; Many &quot; side )
The following list orders filter propagation performance , from fastest to slowest performance :
1 . One-to-many intra-island relationships
2 . Many-to-many cardinality relationships
3 . Many-to-many model relationships achieved with an intermediary table and that involves at least one bi-directional relationship

# Sensitivity labels in Power BI
Microsoft Information Protection sensitivity labels provide a simple way for your users to classify critical content in Power BI without compromising productivity or the ability to collaborate .
# # How sensitivity labels work in Power BI
In Microsoft Office applications , a sensitivity label appears as a tag on the email or document , similar to what is shown in the image above .
# # Sensitivity label inheritance upon creation of new content
The following image shows how a dataset &apos;s sensitivity label is automatically applied on a new report that is built on top of the dataset .
# # Sensitivity labels and protection on exported data
A user who exports a file from Power BI has permissions to access and edit that file according to the sensitivity label settings ; they do not get owner permissions to the file .
Sensitivity labels and protection are not applied when data is exported to .csv , .pbix files , or any other export path .
# # Sensitivity label inheritance in Analyze in Excel
&gt; If the dataset &apos;s sensitivity label is less restrictive than the Excel file &apos;s sensitivity label , no label inheritance or update takes place . An Excel file never inherits a less restrictive sensitivity label .
# # Sensitivity label persistence in embedded reports and dashboards
The following embedding scenarios are supported :
# # Sensitivity labels in the Power BI mobile apps
# # Sensitivity label creation and management
The following list provides some limitations of sensitivity labels in Power BI :

# Edit SAP variables in the Power BI service
# # Requirements for SAP edit variables
There are a few requirements for using the SAP edit variables feature . The following list describes these requirements .
# # How to enable the feature
# # Use SAP edit variables in Power BI Desktop
# # Use SAP edit variables in the service
You can do so by :
# # To connect to a model from Get data
5 . Select the model you want to connect to . This could be either Tabular or Multidimensional .

title : Use insights to explain increases and decreases in visuals ( Preview )
The insights feature is contextual , and is based on the immediately previous data point - such as the previous bar , or column .
By selecting the small icons at the bottom of the waterfall visual , you can choose to have insights display a scatter chart , stacked column chart , or a ribbon chart .
You can use insights when your report is in reading or editing mode , making it versatile for both analyzing data , and for creating visuals you can easily add to your reports .
# # Details of the results returned
# # # The scatter plot
The dotted line shows the best fit , and as such , data points above this line increased by more than the overall trend , and those below it by less .
Note that data items whose value was blank in either period will not appear on the scatter plot ( for example , * Home Appliances * in this case )
# # # The 100 % stacked column chart
# # # The ribbon chart
# # # The waterfall chart
The fourth visual is a waterfall chart , showing the main actual increases or decreases between the periods . This visual clearly shows the actual changes , but does not alone indicate the changes to the level of contribution that actually highlight why the column was chosen as being interesting .
When ranking the column as to which have the largest differences in the relative contributions , the following is considered :
* The cardinality is factored in , as a difference is less statistically significant , and less interesting , when a column has a large cardinality .
* Various heuristics are employed to select the most meaningful results , for example by considering other relationships between the data .
After examining different columns , those that show the biggest change to relative contribution are chosen and output . For each , the values which had the most significant change to contribution are called out in the description . In addition , the values that had the largest actual increases and decreases are also called out .
Since these insights are based on the change from the previous data point , they aren &apos;t available when you select the first data point in a visual .
* Include / exclude filters
* Measure filters
* Non-numeric measures
* Use of &quot; Show value as &quot;
* Categorical columns on X-axis unless it defines a sort by column that is scalar . If using a hierarchy , then every column in the active hierarchy has to match this condition
In addition , the following model types and data sources are currently not supported for insights :
* On-premises Reporting Services
* Shape data by using Query Editor .
* Connect to different data sources .
* Combine those data sources , and create a data model to use in reports .
In the following image , the * * Applied Steps * * list reflects the added steps so far :
Before we can work with this query , we need to make a few changes to adjust its data :
- Adjust the rankings by removing a column .
- Fix a few errors .
- Sort the data .
- Replace the data .
We &apos;ll highlight how to replace a specific value and the need of inserting an * * Applied Step * * .
- Change the table name .
1 . Right-click a step . Query Editor provides a menu that lets you do the following tasks :
Notice the data now shows _ Error _ , which we &apos;ll need to address .
There are a few ways to get more information about each error . If you select the cell without clicking on the word * Error * , Query Editor displays the error information on the bottom of the window .
Query Editor replaces the data with the revised values and the * * Added Custom * * step completes with no errors .
Because we &apos;re inserting a step , Query Editor warns us about the danger of doing so ; subsequent steps could cause the query to break .
We ’ ve now shaped our data to the extent we need to . Next let ’ s connect to another data source , and combine data .
We ’ re in luck ; there ’ s another public data source that does just that , but it needs a fair amount of shaping before we can connect it to our retirement table . TO shape the data , follow these steps :
The Navigator displays the content of the website .
In this case , we want to merge the queries . To do so , follow these steps :
You may be prompted to set the privacy levels , to ensure the data is combined without including or transferring data you don &apos;t want transferred .

Here are some of the most common ways to use parameters .
- Filter paginated report data at the data source by writing dataset queries that contain variables .
- Enable users to specify values to help customize the appearance of a report . For example , provide a Boolean parameter to indicate whether to expand or collapse all nested row groups in a table .
- Enable users to customize report data and appearance by including parameters in an expression .
You can create report parameters in a few different ways .
&gt; Not all data sources support parameters .
* * Dataset query or stored procedure with parameters * *
This image from Report Builder shows :
2 . The dataset with the parameters .
4 . The parameters listed in the Dataset Properties dialog box .
Create a parameter manually from the Report Data pane . You can configure report parameters so that a user can interactively enter values to help customize the contents or appearance of a report . You can also configure report parameters so that a user cannot change preconfigured values .
&gt; Because parameters are managed independently on the server , republishing a main report with new parameter settings doesn &apos;t overwrite the existing parameters settings on the report .
The following are options for selecting parameter values in the report .
- Select a single parameter value from a drop-down list .
- Select multiple parameter values from a drop-down list .
- Run the report without having to first select a parameter value because a default value has been created for the parameter .
&#124; Prompt &#124; The text that appears next to the parameter on the report viewer toolbar . &#124;
&#124; Internal &#124; Select this option to hide the report parameter . In the published report , the report parameter can only be viewed in the report definition . &#124;
To filter data in the dataset query , you can include a restriction clause that limits the retrieved data by specifying values to include or exclude from the result set .
Use the query designer for the data source to help build a parameterized query .
For a published report , you can use the following :
Report execution options can affect how parameters are processed . A report that runs as a snapshot cannot use parameters that are derived from a query unless the query includes default values for the parameters .
You can define a subscription for an on demand or for a snapshot and specify parameter values to use during subscription processing .
title : Local Storage API in Power BI Visuals
The Local Storage API is an API a custom visual can use to request the host to save or load data from the device &apos;s storage . It &apos;s isolated in the sense that there &apos;s separation of storage access between different visual types .

title : Power BI visuals interactivity utils
Interactivity utils ( `InteractivityUtils` ) is a set of functions and classes that can be used to simplify the implementation of cross-selection and cross-filtering .
&gt; The new updates of interactivity utils support only the latest version of tools ( 3.x.x and above ) .
3 . To use interactivity utils , import the required component in the source code of the Power BI visual .
# # # Including the CSS files
To use the package with your Power BI visual , import the following CSS file to your `.less` file .
Usually , data points contain selections and values . The interface extends the `SelectableDataPoint` interface .
`SelectableDataPoint` already contains properties as described below .
# # Defining an interface for data points
1 . Create an instance of interactivity utils and save the object as a property of the visual
2 . Extend the base behavior class .
3 . Define the interface for the behavior class options .
The class is responsible to handle `click` `contextmenu` mouse events .
When a user clicks on data elements , the visual calls the selection handler to select data points. if the user clicks on the background element of the visual , it calls the clear selection handler .
The class has the following correspond methods :
7 . To assign functions to handlers , the interactivity utils calls the `bindEvents` method . Add the following calls to the `bindEvents` method :
9 . The last step is creating an instance of `visual behavior` , and calling the `bind` method of the interactivity utils instance .
# Scatter charts , bubble charts , and dot plot charts in Power BI
You can set the number of data points , up to a maximum of 10,000 .
# # # Scatter and bubble charts
Scatter charts are a great choice :
* To show relationships between two numerical values .
* To plot two groups of numbers as one series of x and y coordinates .
* To use instead of a line chart when you want to change the scale of the horizontal axis .
* To turn the horizontal axis into a logarithmic scale .
&gt; In a scatter chart , you can adjust the independent scales of the axes to reveal more information about the grouped values .
In addition to what Scatter charts can do for you , bubble charts are a great choice :
* If your data has three data series that each contains a set of values .
* To present financial data . Different bubble sizes are useful to visually emphasize specific values .
* To use with quadrants .
# # # Dot plot charts
A dot plot chart is similar to a bubble chart and scatter chart , but is instead used to plot categorical data along the X-Axis .
They &apos;re a great choice if you want to include categorical data along the X-Axis .
# # Create a scatter chart
Now let &apos;s add a third dimension .
# # Create a bubble chart
You can set the max data volume to any number up to 10,000 . As you get into the higher numbers , we suggest testing first to ensure good performance .
- Continue exploring the Analytics pane to discover interesting insights in your data .
# # Create a dot plot chart
# # # Your scatter chart has only one data point
Does your scatter chart have only one data point that aggregates all the values on the X- and Y-axes ? Or maybe it aggregates all the values along a single horizontal or vertical line ?
If you don &apos;t have that in your data , create a field that concatenates your X and Y values together into something unique per point :

# Personalize visuals in a report
It &apos;s hard to make one visual that satisfies everyone &apos;s requirements . But , when a colleague shares a report with you , you may want to make changes to the visuals -- without having to ask your colleague to make the changes for you .
# # What you can change
This feature helps you gain further insights through ad-hoc exploration of visuals on a Power BI report . Here are some of the modifications that you can make . The available options vary by visual type .
- Change the visualization type
- Swap out a measure or dimension
- Add or remove a legend
- Compare two or more measures
Not only does this feature allow for new exploration capabilities . It also includes ways for you to capture and share your changes :
- Capture your changes
- Share your changes
- Reset all your changes for a report
- Reset all your changes for a visual
- Clear out your recent changes
# # Personalize visuals in the Power BI service
By personalizing a visual , you can explore your data in many ways , without leaving report reading view . The following examples show different ways you can modify a visualization to meet your needs .
1 . Open a report in reading view in the Power BI service .
# # # Change the visualization type
Replace the field being used for the X axis by selecting the field that you want to replace , then selecting a different field .
# # # Add or remove a legend
By adding a legend , you can color-code a visual based on a category . In this example , we &apos;re color-coding based on company name .
# # # Compare two or more different measures
You can also make the bookmark your default view .
If you have read and reshare permissions , when you share the report you can choose to include your changes .
# # # Reset all your changes to a report
# # # Reset all your changes to a visual
# # # Clear recent changes
Select the eraser icon to clear all recent changes you &apos;ve made since you opened the * * Personalize * * pane .
# # Limitations and known issues
Currently the feature has a few limitations to be aware of .
- User explorations don &apos;t automatically persist . You need to save your view as a personal bookmark to capture your changes .
There are also some known issues that we &apos;re addressing :
- Adding a hierarchy isn &apos;t supported ; you need to add each of the individual child items .
# Support timeline for Power BI Report Server
This support policy allows us to deliver innovation to customers at a rapid rate while providing flexibility for customers to adopt the innovation at their pace .
* Security and Critical Updates servicing phase - When running the latest current version of Power BI Report Server , you receive both Security and Critical updates .
- A well-designed report conveys information that leads to action . Identify the questions that the report helps to answer . Keep those questions in mind as you design the report .
- Use naming conventions for data sources and datasets that document the source of data .
- As a first step , get all the data that you want to work with to appear in the Report Data pane . As you refine the questions that the report is designed to answer , think about how to limit the data in the report datasets to just what is needed .
The report design surface is not WYSIWIG . When you place report items on the design surface , their relative location affects the way that the items appear on the rendered report page . White space is preserved .
- Use arrow keys to adjust the position and size of selected items on the design surface . For example , the following key combinations are very useful :
- To add an item to a rectangle , use the upper left tip of the mouse to point to the initial location of the item in the rectangle container . Use keyboard shortcuts to help position selected objects . The rectangle automatically expands to accommodate the size of the contained items .
- To add multiple items to a tablix cell , first add a rectangle , and then add the items .
By default , each tablix cell contains a text box . When you add a rectangle to a cell , the rectangle replaces the text box . For example , place nested indicators in a rectangle in a tablix cell to help control how the size of a chart or indicator expands as you change the height of the row that the cell is in .
- To drag fields from the Report Data pane to the Grouping pane , avoid dragging the field across other report items on the design surface because this selects the other items and unselects the tablix data region . Drag the field down the Report Data pane and then across to the Grouping pane .
To help select the object that you want on the report design surface , use the ESC key , the right-click context menu , the Properties pane , and the Grouping pane .
- - Press ESC to cycle through the stack of report items that occupy the same space on the design surface .
- On some report items , try using the right-click context menu to select the report item or the part of the report item that you want .
- The Properties pane displays properties for the current selection .
- To work with row groups and column groups in a tablix data region , select the group from the Grouping pane .
- The primary purpose of report parameters is to filter data at the data source , and retrieve just what is needed for the purpose of the report .
- You can set format properties and actions on a text box or on placeholder text in the text box . If there is only one line of text , it &apos;s more efficient to set properties on the text box than on the text .
- Understand simple and complex expression formats . You can type simple expression format directly into text boxes , properties in the Property pane , or in locations in dialog boxes that accept an expression .
- On the report design surface , report items grow to accommodate the contents from the associated dataset , expression , subreport , or text .
- When you position an item on the report page , the distance between the item and all items that begin to the right of it becomes the minimum distance that must be maintained as a report item grows horizontally . Similarly , the distance between an item and the item above it becomes a minimum distance that must be maintained as the top item grows vertically .
- An item in a report grows to accommodate its data and pushes peer items ( items within the same parent container ) out of the way using the following rules :
- Each item moves right to maintain the minimum space between itself and the items that end to the left of it . For systems that right-to-left layouts , each item moves left to maintain the minimum space between itself and the items that end to the right of it .
- If you plan to save the report as a .pdf file , the report width must be explicitly set to a value that gives you the results that you want in the export file format . For example , set the report page width to exactly 7.9375 inches and the left and right margins to .5 inches .
1 . Remove all extra white space between data regions and on the edges of the report .
4 . In column headers , change the text box property WritingMode to use vertical text .

The interface through which you manage tooltips is the &quot; ITooltipService . &quot; It &apos;s used to notify the host that a tooltip needs to be displayed , removed , or moved .
`TooltipShowOptions` and `TooltipHideOptions` would in turn define what to display and how to behave in these events .
Because calling these methods involves user events such as mouse moves and touch events , it &apos;s a good idea to create listeners for these events , which would in turn invoke the `TooltipService` members .
Our sample aggregates in a class called `TooltipServiceWrapper` .
# # # The TooltipServiceWrapper class
The bar chart constructor now has a `TooltipServiceWrapper` member , which is instantiated in the constructor with the host `tooltipService` instance .
The `TooltipServiceWrapper` class holds the `tooltipService` instance , also as the root D3 element of the visual and touch parameters .
The single entry point for this class to register event listeners is the `addTooltip` method .
As you can see , `addTooltip` exits with no action if the `tooltipService` is disabled or there &apos;s no real selection .
# # # Call the show method to display a tooltip
The `addTooltip` method next listens to the D3 `mouseover` event , as shown in the following code :
Additional handling can be found in the sample for `mouseout` and `mousemove` events .
# # # Populate the tooltip content by the getTooltipData method
# # # Call the addTooltip method
To add report page tooltips support , you &apos;ll find most changes in the * capabilities.json * file .
A sample schema is
* `supportedTypes` : The tooltip configuration that &apos;s supported by the visual and reflected in the fields well .
* `canvas` : Specifies whether the report page tooltips are supported .
An example of sending the selectionId to tooltip display calls is shown in the following code :
# Sorting options for Power BI visuals
The sorting capability requires one of the following parameters .
The `default` option is the simplest form . It allows sorting the data presented in the &apos; DataMappings &apos; section . The option enables sorting of the data mappings by the user and specifies the sorting direction .
`clauses` parameters can contain several objects with two parameters :
Custom sorting means that the sorting is managed by the developer in the visual &apos;s code .
# Forgot your password for Power BI ?
If you &apos;ve forgotten your password , you can use the following link to request a password reset .
If you &apos;re told your account isn &apos;t set up for password reset , contact your admin . If you &apos;re using the free trial , the admin is the first person in your organization who signed up .
It &apos;s important to note that this phone number is not the Power BI service support number .

# Basic concepts for the Power BI service consumers
# # Open the Power BI service for the first time
But before we get much further , let &apos;s back up and talk about the building blocks that make up the Power BI service .
# # # Introduction to building blocks
At its most basic :
When a designer shares an app with you , you can see which datasets the designer included with the app .
One dataset ...
- Can be used over and over by a report designer to create dashboards and reports
- Can be used to create many different reports
- Visuals from that one dataset can appear on many different dashboards
On to the next building block -- visualizations .
One visualization in a report ...
- Can appear on many different dashboards
One report ...
- Can be associated with multiple dashboards ( tiles pinned from that one report can appear on multiple dashboards ) .
- Can be created using data from only one dataset .
- Can be part of multiple apps .
What are some purposes for dashboards ? Here are just a few :
- to see , in one glance , all the info needed to make decisions
- to monitor the most-important info about your business
- to ensure all colleagues are on the same page ; viewing and using the same info
- to monitor the health of a business or product or business unit or marketing campaign , and so on
- to create a personalized view of a larger dashboard -- all the metrics that matter to you
- can display visualizations from many different datasets
- can display visualizations from many different reports
- can display visualizations pinned from other tools ( for example , Excel )
&gt; The use of apps requires a Power BI Pro or Premium license .
This app has three related dashboards and three related reports that make up a single app .
You can get apps in a few different ways :
- The app designer can install the app automatically in your Power BI account .
- The app designer can send you a direct link to an app .
I hope this article gave you an understanding of the building blocks that make up the Power BI service for consumers .
- Watch a video in which Will reviews the basic concepts and gives a tour of the Power BI service .
# Troubleshoot gateways - Power BI
Verify that you have the correct username and password . Also , verify that those credentials can successfully connect to the data source . Make sure the account that &apos;s being used matches the authentication method .
You were able to connect to the server but not to the database that was supplied . Verify the name of the database and that the user credential has the proper permission to access that database .
This error might occur for different reasons . Be sure to validate that you can connect to the data source from the machine that hosts the gateway . This situation could be the result of the server not being accessible .
You were unable to connect to the specified data source . Be sure to validate the information provided for that data source .
To confirm whether the attribute is enabled , follow these steps .
You want to see something similar to the following in the results :
To correct this issue , you must enable TGGAU on the account used for the Analysis Services Windows service .
This error could also be caused if the Analysis Services server is in a different domain than the users and there isn &apos;t a two-way trust established .
Work with your domain administrators to verify the trust relationship between domains .
# # # Error : There is not enough space for this row .
This error occurs if you have a single row greater than 4 MB in size . Determine what the row is from your data source , and attempt to filter it out or reduce the size for that row .
# # # Error : You don &apos;t see the on-premises data gateway present when you configure scheduled refresh .
A few different scenarios could be responsible for this error :
# # # Error : The received uncompressed data on the gateway client has exceeded the limit .
This error is usually caused by one of the following :
- There &apos;s no data source available on any gateway within your organization . You can configure the data source on a new or existing on-premises data gateway .
3 . Run the following query . You see a rather large JSON response .
The ImpersonationLevel is related to the SPN setup or the local policy setting .
Follow these steps to solve the issue .
1 . Set up an SPN for the on-premises gateway .
2 . Set up constrained delegation in your Active Directory .
The FailedToImpersonateUserException happens if you &apos;re unable to impersonate on behalf of another user . This error could also happen if the account you &apos;re trying to impersonate is from another domain than the one the gateway service domain is on . This is a limitation .
* Verify that the configuration is correct as per the steps in the previous &quot; ImpersonationLevel &quot; section .
* Ensure that the user ID it &apos;s trying to impersonate is a valid Active Directory account .
# # # General error : 1033 error while you parse the protocol
You get the &quot; -10709 Connection failed &quot; error message if your delegation isn &apos;t configured correctly in Active Directory .
# Troubleshooting sign-in for Power BI Desktop
To determine which problem is causing your sign-in issue , the first step is to contact your administrator and provide diagnostic information so that they can determine the cause of the issue . By tracing issues associated with your sign-in problem , administrators can determine which of the following errors apply to you .
# # Proxy Authentication Required error
The following screen shows an example of the * Proxy Authentication Required * error .
If your network uses a proxy authentication server , your administrator can fix this issue by adding the following domains to the allow list on the proxy authentication server :
* domains in the * .analysis.windows.net namespace
For customers who are part of a government cloud , fixing this issue can be done by adding the following domains to the allow list on the proxy authentication server :
* domains in the * .analysis.usgovcloudapi.net namespace
* * Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory.AdalServiceException : Non-HTTPS url redirect is not supported in webview *
# # Using default system credentials for web proxy
The registry entry can be placed in either of the following locations :
It is not necessary to have the registry entry in both locations .
As with any change to proxy or credential settings , there are security implications to creating this registry entry , so administrators must make sure they have configured the Internet Explorer proxies correctly before enabling this feature .
# # # Limitations and considerations for using default system credentials
There are a collection of security implications that administrators should consider before enabling this capability .
The following recommendations should be followed whenever enabling this feature for clients :
* If users are not on a network with a proxy when this feature is enabled and configured as recommended in this section , the process of attempting to contact the proxy server and using default system credentials is not used .
# # How are backup instances kept in sync with my data ?
# # Where are the failover clusters located ?
# # How does Microsoft decide to fail over ?
There are two different systems that indicate when a failover might be required :
- Microsoft Azure &apos;s central operations team informs us of a critical outage in a region .
In both cases , Power BI executive team members make the decision to fail over ; the decision itself isn &apos;t automated . Once the decision is made , the process of failing over takes place automatically .
# # How do I know Power BI is now in failover mode ?
# # How long does it take Power BI to fail over ?
# # What happens to workspaces and reports if my Premium capacity becomes unavailable ?
If a Premium capacity becomes unavailable , workspaces and reports remain accessible and visible to all Power BI Pro licensed users who previously had access to them .
# # When does my Power BI instance return to the original region ?
If the Power BI solution used in your organization involves one of the following elements , you must take some measures to guarantee that the solution remains highly available :
# # Will gateways function when in failover mode ?
# # Get a link from Excel
# # Use the link in Power BI Desktop
In Power BI Desktop , you can use the link you just copied to the clipboard . Take the following steps :
title : How Power BI ensures your content is up-to-date
If you have questions about the data freshness , contact the designer .
# # How to locate the name of the designer or owner
# # # Dashboard or report
The app screen shows you both the name of the designer as well as the date the app was last updated .
# # # Shared with me
# # How to look up the last refresh date
If interested , you can look up the last refreshed date for most content .
For dashboard tiles , view the tile in Focus mode to see the Last refresh timestamp .
2 . The last refresh date displays in the upper right corner . If you don &apos;t see it , expand your browser to make it wider .

title : Pin a tile to a Power BI dashboard from a report
# Pin a tile to a Power BI dashboard from a report
You can &apos;t pin tiles from reports that have been shared with you or from Power BI Desktop .
&gt; Because some visualizations use background images , pinning might not work if the background image is too large . Try reducing the image size or using image compression .
Watch Amanda create a dashboard by pinning visuals and images from a Power BI report .
Now create your own dashboard by using one of the Power BI sample reports .
2 . Select whether to pin to an existing dashboard or new dashboard .
A success message ( near the top-right corner ) informs you the visualization was added , as a tile , to your dashboard .

# # Use the data source
After you create the data source , it &apos;s available to use with either DirectQuery connections or through scheduled refresh .
&gt; The server and database names must match between Power BI Desktop and the data source within the on-premises data gateway .
This requirement is the case for both DirectQuery and scheduled refresh .
# # # Use the data source with DirectQuery connections
# # # Use the data source with scheduled refresh
title : Change how visuals interact in a report
# Change how visuals interact in a Power BI report
By default , visualizations on a report page can be used to cross-filter and cross-highlight the other visualizations on the page .
For example , selecting a state on a map visualization highlights the column chart and filters the line chart to display only data that applies to that one state .
# # Enable the visual interaction controls
If you have edit permissions to a report , you can turn on the visual interaction controls and then customize how the visualizations on your report page filter and highlight each other .
- In the Power BI service , open the report in Editing view and select the dropdown from the report menu bar .
# # Change the interaction behavior
If the selected visualization should :
# # Change the interactions of drillable visualizations
1 . Select the drillable visual to make it active .
2 . Turn on drill down by selecting the drill down icon .
If you build a matrix with fields from different tables , then try to cross-highlight by selecting multiple items at different levels of the hierarchy , you get errors on the other visuals .

# Create bookmarks in Power BI Desktop to share insights and build stories
You can also create a collection of bookmarks , arrange them in the order you want , and later step through each bookmark in a presentation to highlight a series of insights , or the story you want to tell with your visuals and reports .
When you create a bookmark , the following elements are saved with the bookmark :
* The current page
* Visual selection state ( such as cross-highlight filters )
The yellow bar between bookmarks designates where the dragged bookmark will be placed .
# # Bookmarks as a slide show
1 . The name of the bookmark appears in the bookmark title bar , which appears at the bottom of the canvas .
2 . The bookmark title bar has arrows that let you move to the next or previous bookmark .
In the * * Selection * * pane , you select an object and toggle whether the object is currently visible by selecting the eye icon to the right of the object .
# # Bookmarks for shapes and images
To assign a bookmark to an object :
There are all sorts of interesting things you can do with object-linked bookmarking . You can create a visual table of contents on your report page , or you can provide different views ( such as visual types ) of the same information .
To create a bookmark group :
As with any bookmark group , expanding the bookmark group &apos;s name only expands or collapses the group of bookmarks , and doesn &apos;t represent a bookmark by itself .
To ungroup bookmarks :
1 . Select any bookmark in a group and select the ellipsis .
To remove a single bookmark from a group :
Let &apos;s compare spotlight to focus mode to see how they differ :
If either the focus or spotlight mode is selected when you add a bookmark , that mode is retained in the bookmark .
# # Bookmarks in the Power BI service
# # Enable the bookmarks preview ( versions prior to March 2018 )
Beginning with the March 2018 version of Power BI Desktop , bookmarks are generally available .
To enable the preview bookmarks feature :
In this release of the bookmarks features , there are a few limitations and considerations to keep in mind .
* Moving a visual after a bookmark has been created is automatically reflected in the bookmark .
For more information about features that are similar or interact with bookmarks , see the following articles :
By default , relationships will be set to cross-filter in both directions . Cross-filtering in just one direction limited some of the modeling capabilities in a relationship .

If you have a personal gateway configured and it &apos;s online , it &apos;s available to select . It shows offline if it &apos;s not available .
You &apos;re only required to sign in to a data source the first time you use refresh on that dataset . Once entered , those credentials are retained with the dataset .
&gt; The target is to initiate the refresh within 15 minutes of the scheduled time slot , but a delay of up to one hour can occur if the service can &apos;t allocate the required resources sooner .
&gt; Scheduled refresh will also get disabled automatically after four consecutive errors .
Certain datasets are supported against different gateways for scheduled refresh . Here is a reference to understand what is available .

As long as you are connected to an external organization , a black header appears in the app . This header indicates that you are not connected to your home organization . To connect back to your home organization , exit from guest mode .
- Users must have an active Power BI account and Home tenant .
- Users must be signed in to their Power BI home tenant , before they can access the content shared with them from an external tenant .
- Push notifications are received from the home organization site only ( even when the user is connected as a guest to an external organization ) . Opening the notification reconnects the app to the user &apos;s home organization site .
- If the user shuts down the app , when reopened the app connects automatically to the user &apos;s home organization .
- Offline data is not available while connected to an external organization .
title : Embed paginated reports in your application for your customers
# Tutorial : Embed Power BI paginated reports into an application for your customers
&gt; * Register an application in Azure .
&gt; * Embed a Power BI paginated report into an application .
To get started , you &apos;re required to have :
# # Set up your Power BI environment
Embedding a paginated report requires assigning a workspace to a dedicated capacity , and uploading the report to the workspace .
# # # Create an app workspace
# # # Create a dedicated capacity
Before you import or upload a paginated report to embed , the workspace containing the report must be assigned to at least an A4 or P1 capacity . There are two types of capacity you can choose from :
# # # Assign an app workspace to a dedicated capacity
Once you create a dedicated capacity , you can assign your app workspace to that dedicated capacity .
# # # Create and upload your paginated reports
# # Embed content using the sample application
This sample is deliberately kept simple for demonstration purposes . It &apos;s up to you or your developers to protect the application secret .
Follow the steps below to start embedding your content using the sample application .
Fill in the following fields :
# # # Run the application
3 . Now you can view the report in the sample application .
# # # Get the paginated report you want to embed
You can use the Power BI client object to retrieve a reference to the item you want to embed .
Here is a code sample of how to retrieve the first report from a given workspace .
# # # Create the embed token
# # # Load an item using JavaScript
You can use JavaScript to load a paginated report into a div element on your web page .
title : Configure mobile app access to Report Server remotely
# Configure Power BI mobile app access to Report Server remotely
With the Report Server connection already configured , Power BI mobile app users can connect to their organization &apos;s Report Server more easily .
# # Create the app configuration policy in MDM tool
As admin , here are the steps you follow in Microsoft Intune to create the app configuration policy . The steps and experience of building the app configuration policy may be different in other MDM tools .
1 . Connect your MDM tool .
2 . Create and name a new app configuration policy .
3 . Choose which users to distribute this app configuration policy to .
The following table spells out the pairs .
Here &apos;s an example of setting the configuration policy using Intune .
# # End users connecting to Report Server
Say you publish the app configuration policy for a distribution list . When users and devices on that distribution list start the mobile app , they have the following experience .
Now they can view and interact with KPIs and Power BI reports stored on the Report Server .
Select the * * Select a calculation * * field to see a long list of available quick measures .
The five quick measure calculation types , with their calculations , are :
* Average per category

* Max per category
* Min per category
* Weighted average per category
* Filtered value
* Difference from filtered value
* Percentage difference from filtered value
* Sales from new customers
* Year-to-date total

To submit your ideas about new quick measures you &apos;d like to see , underlying DAX formulas , or other quick measures ideas for consideration , see the end of this article .
Let &apos;s take a look at a quick measure in action .
The following matrix visual shows a sales table for various products . It &apos;s a basic table that includes the sales totals for each category .
# # Learn DAX by using quick measures
The formula bar not only shows you the formula behind the measure , but perhaps more importantly , lets you see how to create the DAX formulas underlying quick measures .
There are a few limitations and considerations to keep in mind .
- Quick measures are only available if you can modify the model . That isn &apos;t the case when you &apos;re working with some Live connections . SSAS tabular live connections are supported , as previously described .
- You can &apos;t create time intelligence quick measures when working in DirectQuery mode . The DAX functions used in these quick measures have performance implications when translated into the T-SQL statements that are sent to your data source .

title : Link entities between dataflows in Power BI
# Link entities between dataflows in Power BI
# # How to link entities between dataflows
To link entities , you must sign in with your Power BI credentials .
Once your linked entities are selected , they appear in the list of entities for your dataflow in the authoring tool , with a special icon identifying them as Linked entities .
You can also view the source dataflow from the dataflow settings of your linked entity .
# # Refresh logic of linked entities
# # # Links between workspaces
# # # Links in the same workspace
It &apos;s useful to note that the entire refresh process commits at once . Because of this , if the destination dataflow refresh fails to refresh , the source dataflow will fail its refresh as well .
# # Permissions when viewing reports from dataflows
When creating a Power BI report that includes data based on a dataflow , users can see any linked entities only when the user has access to the source dataflow .
There are a few limitations to keep in mind when working with linked entities :
* There is a maximum of five referencing hops
* Cyclic dependencies of linked entities are not allowed
* A linked entity can &apos;t be joined with a regular entity that gets its data from an on-premises data source
The following articles may be useful as you create or work with dataflows .
For more information about Power Query and scheduled refresh , you can read these articles :
For more information about the Common Data Model , you can read its overview article :
In the Power BI service , users have defined capabilities based on the type of per-user license they have and whether the content they are acting on is in a workspace assigned to a Power BI Premium capacity .

title : How to configure workloads in Power BI Premium
# Configure workloads in a Premium capacity
The AI workload lets you use cognitive services and Automated Machine Learning in Power BI . Use the following settings to control workload behavior .
&#124; Setting Name &#124; Description &#124;
# # # # Max Intermediate Row Set Count
Use this setting to control the impact of resource-intensive or poorly designed reports . When a query to a DirectQuery dataset results in a very large result from the source database , it can cause a spike in memory usage and processing overhead . This situation can lead to other users and reports running low on resources . This setting allows the capacity administrator to adjust how many rows an individual query can fetch from the data source .
Alternatively , if the capacity can support more than the one million row default , and you have a large dataset , increase this setting to fetch more rows .
# # # # Max Offline Dataset Size
Use this setting to prevent report creators from publishing a large dataset that could negatively impact the capacity . Note that Power BI cannot determine actual in-memory size until the dataset is loaded into memory . It is possible that a dataset with a smaller offline size can have a larger memory footprint than a dataset with a larger offline size .
# # # # Max Result Row Set Count
Use this setting to control the impact of resource-intensive or poorly designed reports . If this limit is reached in a DAX query , a report user sees the following error . They should copy the error details and contact an administrator .
# # # # Query Memory Limit
This setting applies to all DAX and MDX queries that are executed by Power BI reports , Analyze in Excel reports , as well as other tools which might connect over the XMLA endpoint .
Note that data refresh operations may also execute DAX queries as part of refreshing the dashboard tiles and visual caches after the data in the dataset has been refreshed . Such queries may also potentially fail because of this setting , and this could lead to the data refresh operation being shown in a failed state , even though the data in the dataset was successfully updated .
The default setting is 0 , which results in the following SKU-specific automatic query memory limit being applied .
Use this setting to maintain better control of long-running queries , which can cause reports to load slowly for users .
This setting applies to a single query and not the length of time it takes to run all of the queries associated with updating a dataset or report . Consider the following example :
- There are five queries to execute , and each runs 15 minutes .
Note that Power BI reports override this default with a much smaller timeout for each query to the capacity . The timeout for each query is typically about three minutes .
- Turn automatic page refresh on and off
- Define a minimum refresh interval
The following image shows the location of the automatic refresh interval setting :
Queries created by automatic page refresh go directly to the data source , so it &apos;s important to consider reliability and load on those sources when allowing automatic page refresh in your organization .
# # # # Container size
- Dataflows take too long to refresh , or dataflow refresh fails on a timeout .
- Dataflow entities include computation steps , for example , a join .
Maximize your capacity &apos;s available resources by enabling workloads only if they will be used . Change memory and other settings only when you have determined default settings are not meeting your capacity resource requirements .

# Perform common query tasks in Power BI Desktop
The common query tasks demonstrated here are :
* Connect to data
* Shape and combine data
* Group rows
* Create custom columns
We ’ ll use a few data connections to complete these tasks . The data is available for you to download or connect to , in case you want to step through these tasks yourself .
Common query tasks begin at the steps necessary to connect to both of those data sources .
# # Shape and combine data
When you shape data , you transform a data source into the form and format that meets your needs .
# Connect to Smartsheet with Power BI
After you &apos;ve installed the template app , you can change the dashboard and report . Then you can distribute it as an app to colleagues in your organization .
&gt; A Smartsheet admin account is preferred for connecting and loading the Power BI template app as it has additional access .
# # Modify and distribute your app

# # Create a ribbon chart
Ribbon charts connect a category of data over the visualized time continuum using ribbons , enabling you to see how a given category ranks throughout the span of the chart &apos;s x-axis ( usually the timeline ) .
# # Format a ribbon chart
These formatting options for ribbon charts let you make adjustments .
Set formatting options for your data labels . In this example , we &apos;ve set the text color to white and display units to thousands .
title : High-Density Scatter Charts in Power BI
# High density sampling in Power BI scatter charts
# # How high-density scatter charts work
# # How the new scatter chart sampling algorithm works
The methods in this algorithm ensure that outliers are represented in the resulting visual . The algorithm respects scale when determining overlap , too , such that exponential scales are visualized with fidelity to the underlying visualized points .
The algorithm also preserves the overall shape of the scatter chart .
# # # When the standard algorithm for scatter charts is used
* If both X and Y axes are missing on a scatter chart , the chart reverts to the original algorithm .
The high-density sampling algorithm is an important improvement to Power BI , but there are a few considerations to know when working with high-density values and scatter charts .

title : Upgrade classic workspaces to the new workspaces
# Upgrade classic workspaces to the new workspaces in Power BI
&gt; Workspace upgrade is available as a Public Preview .
# # Things to do after upgrading
# # Upgrade a classic workspace
Any workspace admin can upgrade the workspace . For classic workspaces , to be a workspace admin you must be an Owner of the underlying Microsoft 365 group . To upgrade a workspace , follow these steps .
# # # Impact on other workspace users
We recommend upgrading during off-hours when few users are actively viewing or editing items in the workspace .
Select * * Access * * in the menu bar at the top of the workspace content list to review permissions after upgrade .
# # # Differences in roles before and after upgrade
Workspace roles are different in the classic and new workspaces . The new workspace experience enables you to give workspace roles to Microsoft 365 groups , security groups , or distribution lists .
Any users who have access to items in the workspace through sharing or app permission continue to have access to those items . Anyone with access to the workspace also has access to the app published from the workspace . These users aren &apos;t listed in the app access list .
We recommend evaluating whether to use the new Contributor role . After upgrade , you can change the Microsoft 365 group to have the Contributor role in the Access pane .
After upgrade , you may consider creating a security or Microsoft 365 group or distribution list for workspace admins , instead of managing access through role assignments to individual users .
Users in the Admin , Member , or Contributor workspace roles need a Power BI Pro license to access the workspace .
# # Other new workspace features
The new workspace experience has features that the classic workspaces don &apos;t have . One difference is the ability to set a contact list that &apos;s different from the workspace admins or owners . One similarity is that it &apos;s still connected to the Microsoft 365 group SharePoint document library .
# # # Modify the contact list
# # # The workspace OneDrive
# # Content packs during upgrade
# # # Published content packs
# # # Installed content packs
However , there are important changes :
- The content no longer updates if the content pack is updated .
- The URLs and item identifiers change and require any bookmarks or links you &apos;ve shared with others to be updated .
- New users may not have access to the datasets that were in the content pack . You need work with the dataset owner to ensure workspace users have access to the data .
# # Go back to a classic workspace
1 . When the switch back is complete , you see a confirmation dialog box .
# # # Considerations for switching back to classic
You can &apos;t switch back if any of the following statements about your workspace are true :
- The Microsoft 365 group was deleted .
- It &apos;s been more than 30 days since you upgraded .
- The workspace is part of an application life-cycle management pipeline .
- The workspace is used for template apps .
- The workspace uses the large models capability .
- The workspace uses the new usage metrics feature .
When you switch back to a classic workspace , you aren &apos;t restoring an exact copy of the original workspace . The following changes occur :
- Permissions for the workspace are set by the Microsoft 365 group the upgraded workspace was originally connected to .
- Any admins of the Microsoft 365 group become admins of the classic workspace .
- Users who received access to the app for the workspace continue to have access to the app .
- Users who received access to items in the workspace through sharing continue to have access to them .
- Content packs published from the classic workspace before upgrade aren &apos;t restored .
- Content packs installed in the classic workspace before upgrade aren &apos;t restored .
- Subscriptions created by users in the workspace after upgrade are removed . Subscriptions that existed before upgrade continue to work as expected .
- Data alerts aren &apos;t preserved . They &apos;re removed .
- If you renamed the workspace after upgrade , the name of the workspace is restored to match the name of the Microsoft 365 group .
# # Manage migration to the new workspaces for your tenant
Some organizations desire to move many or all workspaces to the new workspace experience . The workspace upgrade tooling focuses on enabling workspace admins to upgrade . For organizations wanting to manage such a process , they can take the following steps .
There are several known issues that you may encounter :
- After upgrading users may see a &quot; Failure to load model &quot; warning dialog . This message is shown erroneously and can be ignored .
# Create and use doughnut charts in Power BI
A doughnut chart is similar to a pie chart in that it shows the relationship of parts to a whole . The only difference is that the center is blank and allows space for a label or icon .
# # Create a doughnut chart
* The sum of the doughnut chart values must add up to 100 % .
* Too many categories make it difficult to read and interpret .
* Doughnut charts are best used to compare a particular section to the whole , rather than comparing individual sections with each other .

title : Migrate a report server installation
# Migrate a report server installation
Migration is defined as moving application data files to a new Power BI Report Server instance . The following are common reasons why you might migrate your installation :
* You have a large-scale deployment or update requirements
* You &apos;re changing the hardware or topology of your installation
* You encounter an issue that blocks upgrade
Migrating from an SSRS ( Native mode ) instance to Power BI Report Server consists of a few steps .
* Backup database , application , and configuration files
* Back up the encryption key
* Clone your report server database hosting your reports
* Configure the report server using Report Server Configuration Manager and connect to the cloned database .
* Perform any cleanup needed for the SSRS ( Native mode ) instance
# # Migrating from one Power BI Report Server to another
After Power BI imports the data you will see the report with 13 pages and dataset in the nav pane .
From there , you see a dialog that explains you &apos;ll get an * embed code * that lets you include the report on a website or in mail .
Power BI presents a dialog with two links :
* A link you can share in email , which show the report as a web page
For the HTML link , you can choose from predefined sizes for the embedded report , or you can modify the iframe code yourself and customize its size .
You can also embed that iframe link into a blog post or website , or into Sway , too .
And that &apos;s all there is to publishing your Power BI report to the web , and sharing it with the world . It &apos;s easy !
# Manage storage mode in Power BI Desktop
Setting the storage mode provides many advantages . You can set the storage mode for each table individually in your model . This action enables a single dataset , which provides the following benefits :
The storage mode setting in Power BI Desktop is one of three related features :
# # Use the Storage mode property
You set the * * Storage mode * * property to one of these three values :
# # Constraints on DirectQuery and Dual tables
# # Propagation of the Dual setting
Consider the following simple model , where all the tables are from a single source that supports Import and DirectQuery .
The propagation logic traverses only to the one side of one-to-many relationships .
Let &apos;s continue with the example from the previous section , and imagine applying the following storage mode property settings :
* Data-refresh times are improved , and memory consumption is reduced .
# # Queries that hit or miss the cache
* Queries Events \ Query Begin
* Query Processing \ Vertipaq SE Query Begin
* Query Processing \ DirectQuery Begin
Queries that refer to Dual tables return data from the cache , if possible ; otherwise , they revert to DirectQuery .
There are a few limitations for this release of storage mode and its correlation with composite models .
The following live connection ( multi-dimensional ) sources can &apos;t be used with composite models :
When you connect to those multi-dimensional sources by using DirectQuery , you can &apos;t connect to another DirectQuery source or combine it with imported data .
For more information about composite models and DirectQuery , see the following articles :

# # # All / some of the visuals in the report don &apos;t contain any value
The barcode value you scanned exists in your model but all / Some of the visuals on your report don &apos;t contain this value and therefore filtering will return an empty state . Try looking into other report pages or edit your reports in Power BI desktop to contain this value
title : Manage multi-tenancy with Power BI embedded analytics
With Power BI Embedded , there are two main fundamental approaches to maintaining separation between tenants .
This article describes the different approaches and analyzes them according to several evaluation criteria .
* Import - which is the most common way to get data .
* DirectQuery - connect directly to the data in its source repository .
The following are a set of areas to consider when choosing between the different tenancy models .
How sensitive is the data being stored ? What level of isolation do you need separating different customer tenants ? The answer might vary across different industries or specific customers that have certain requirements .
* Number of reports , dashboards , and datasets for each tenant .
* Size of data on each dataset and frequency of refreshes .
* Number of users .
* Number of concurrent users in peak times .
# # # Automation &amp; operational complexity
Identify frequently occurring processes that need automation .
* What is the frequency of onboarding new tenants ? What actions are needed to fully onboard each one ?
* What is the release cadence for new or updated Power BI content , that needs to be deployed ?
* How many row-level security roles are defined for each tenant ?
Identifying these processes and how you address them can help you understand the operational complexity involved in maintaining each model .
# # # Data Residency Requirements and the need to support multiple geographies
# # # Content customization and authoring
There are two approaches to SaaS applications that give users the ability to edit and create reports or upload data into the service as part of the flow :
* A separate database per tenant
* A single multi-tenant database
* Adding a new tenant ( customer )
* Updating a report or dashboard for some or all the tenants
* Updating the dataset schema for some or all the tenants
* Unplanned customizations for specific tenants
* Frequency of dataset refreshes
The workspace-based isolation model sits well with capacities for the following reasons :
Application developers need to consider the limit on the number of parallel refreshes , as refresh processes might need extra capacity when you have multiple datasets .
If the application developer needs to manage many roles and role definitions that need to be created or updated frequently , row-level security-based isolation isn &apos;t scalable , from a manageability perspective .
Another operational complexity is the need to closely monitor memory utilization and build a robust mechanism of alerts and scaling to ensure users get a smooth experience .
# # Summary comparison of the different approaches
* The number of datasets in a single workspace is 1000 .
* The number of reports / dashboards connected to a single dataset is 1000 .
* The max dataset size in a dedicated capacity is 10 GB .
# # # Measure RLS impact
The following rule expression is defined :
Let &apos;s see how you could implement this design requirement . First , consider the following model design :
The model comprises four tables :
Each of the three model relationships is described in the following table :
There are several advantages associated with avoiding RLS :
However , there are disadvantages associated with avoiding RLS :
If RLS produces unexpected results , check for the following issues :
- Incorrect relationships exist between model tables , in terms of column mappings and filter directions .
- Tables contain no data .
- Incorrect values are loaded into tables .
- The user is mapped to multiple roles .
When a specific user can &apos;t see any data , it could be because their UPN isn &apos;t stored or it &apos;s entered incorrectly . It can happen abruptly because their user account has changed as the result of a name change .
When a specific user can see all data , it &apos;s possible they &apos;re accessing reports directly in the workspace and they &apos;re the dataset owner . RLS is only enforced when :
- The report is opened in an app .

title : Use report page drillthrough
It &apos;s recommended that you design your report to allow report users to achieve the following flow :
2 . Identify a visual element to analyze more deeply .
3 . Right-click the visual element to drillthrough .
4 . Perform complimentary analysis .
5 . Return to the source report page .
We suggest that you consider two types of drillthrough scenarios :
When your report page displays summarized results , a drillthrough page can lead report users to transaction-level details . This design approach allows them to view supporting transactions , and only when needed .
The following example shows what happens when a report user drills through from a monthly sales summary . The drillthrough page contains a detailed list of orders for a specific month .
A drillthrough page can achieve the opposite of additional depth . This scenario is great for drilling through to a holistic view .
The following example shows what happens when a report user drills through from a zip code . The drillthrough page displays general information about that zip code .
At report design time , we recommend the following practices :

title : Render events in Power BI visuals
# Render events in Power BI visuals
When rendering starts , the Power BI visual code calls the `renderingStarted` method to indicate that the rendering process has started .
# # # Sample : The visual displays no animations
# # # Sample : The visual displays animations
If the visual has animations or async functions for rendering , the `renderingFinished` method should be called after the animation or inside async function .
# # Rendering events for visual certification
# Create key performance indicator ( KPI ) visualizations
# # When to use a KPI
KPIs are a great choice :
* To measure progress . Answers the question , &quot; What am I ahead or behind on ? &quot;
* To measure distance to a goal . Answers the question , &quot; How far ahead or behind am I ? &quot;
# # How to create a KPI
In this example , you &apos;ll create a KPI that measures the progress you &apos;ve made toward a sales goal .
Once sorted correctly , your visual will look like this :
1 . Optionally , format the KPI by selecting the paint roller icon to open the Formatting pane .
KPIs are also available in the Power BI service and on your mobile devices . It gives you the option to be always connected to your business &apos;s heartbeat .

* can be associated with multiple dashboards within that workspace . Tiles pinned from that one report can appear on multiple dashboards .
Why do people create dashboards ? Here are just some of the reasons :
* to see , in one glance , all the information needed to make decisions .
* to monitor the most-important information about your business .
* to ensure all colleagues are on the same page , viewing and using the same information .
* to monitor the health of a business or product or business unit or marketing campaign , etc .
* to create a personalized view of a larger dashboard -- all the metrics that matter to you .
* is associated with a single workspace

title : The Visual Filters API in Power BI visuals
To enable filtering for the visual , it should contain a `filter` object in the `general` section of * capabilities.json * code .
All filters extend the `IFilter` interface , as shown in the following code :
* `target` is the table column on the data source .
# # The Basic Filter API
Basic filter interface is shown in the following code :
Example of a basic filter :
The SQL equivalent is :
To create a filter , you can use the BasicFilter class in `powerbi-models` .
# # The Advanced Filter API
The filter was introduced in Visuals API 1.7.0 .
Additionally , the filter uses conditions instead of values with the interface :
# # The Tuple Filter API ( multi-column filter )
The filter interface is shown in the following code :
* `target` is an array of columns with table names :
The filter can address columns from various tables .
* `values` is an array of value tuples , and each tuple represents one permitted combination of the target column values .
Complete example :
&gt; The order of the column names and condition values is sensitive .
# # Restore the JSON filter from the data view
Some sample JSON filter code is shown in the following image :
# # # Clear the JSON filter
The Filter API accepts the `null` value of the filter as * reset * or * clear * .
The SSO option takes affect across all datasets that use this data source . It does not affect the authentication method used for import scenarios .

When you import an Excel workbook into Power BI , you may see the following error :
5 . Now your data is formatted as a table :
9 . Import your Excel workbook again . This time , the import should find the table and succeed .
title : Service interruption notifications
At this time , we send emails for the following _ reliability scenarios _ :
- Open report reliability
- Query refresh reliability
The notification email provides information about the reason for the high resource usage , including the following :
* Dataset ID of the responsible dataset
* CPU time associated with the high resource usage
If you have more than one Premium capacity , the email includes information about those capacities during the overloaded period , so you can consider moving the workspaces containing resource intensive items to capacities with the least load .
Overload email notifications are only sent when an overload threshold is triggered . You will not receive a second email when the load on that Premium capacity returns to non-overloaded levels .
The following image shows an example notification email :

With DAX , there are many functions available to shape , form , or otherwise analyze your data . These functions can be grouped into a handful of categories :
Now that we know how to get that DAX formula started , let &apos;s take a look at each of these function categories in turn .
These functions work only on numeric columns , and generally can aggregate only one column at a time .
These functions count different elements , such as distinct values , non-empty values , and table rows .
While these functions can be situationally useful , there is value in knowing the data type of your columns ahead of time , rather than depending on these functions to provide the data type .

Not only does this feature allow for new exploration capabilities . It also includes ways for consumers to capture and share their changes :
- Share their changes
- Reset all their changes for a report
- Reset all their changes for a visual
- Clear out their recent changes
# # Use Perspectives for a more focused view
Keep the following considerations in mind when working with perspectives :
* Perspectives in both tabular and multi-dimensional models are supported . However , for perspectives in multi-dimensional models , you can only set the perspective to be the same as the base cube for the report .
* Before deleting a perspective from a model , be sure to check that the perspective is not being used in the Personalize visuals experience .
In Tabular Editor , right-click on the * * Perspectives * * folder to create a new perspective .
You can double-click the text to rename the perspective .
Repeat that process for each field you want to add to the perspective . You can ’ t add duplicate fields in a perspective , so any fields you already added to a perspective will have the option to add it disabled .
# # Enable personalization in a report
After you turn on the preview switch , you need to specifically enable it for the reports that you want consumers to be able to personalize visuals for .
# # # In the Power BI service
# # Select visuals that can be personalized
- This feature isn &apos;t supported for embed scenarios , including publish to web .
- Adding hierarchy isn &apos;t supported ; you need to add the individual child items .
- You can &apos;t change a date hierarchy to a date or vice-versa .
title : Collaborate in a classic workspace
# Collaborate in a classic workspace
After you create a Power BI Desktop file , you can publish it to a workspace so everyone in the workspace can collaborate on it .
From here , it &apos;s like any other report in Power BI . You and others in the workspace can modify the report and save tiles to a dashboard of your choosing .
# # Collaborate in Microsoft 365
Collaborating in Microsoft 365 starts from the classic workspace in Power BI .
2 . From this menu , you can collaborate with your group in a few ways :
# # Schedule an event on the group workspace calendar
# # Manage a classic workspace
Fortunately , Power BI has tools to quickly transform multi-column tables into datasets that you can use .
Once you do that a few times , as described in the video , your table begins to shape into something that Power BI can more easily work with .
In this article , you create a paginated report for Power BI Report Server in a few simple steps .
If you don &apos;t have Report Builder installed already , it leads you through the installation process now .
3 . Select the wizard for the kind of report you want to create :
* Table or matrix
4 . Let &apos;s start with the Chart wizard .
The Chart wizard walks you the steps of creating a basic chart in a report . From there , you can customize your report in almost unlimited ways .

# Visualization types in Power BI
We &apos;ll be adding new visualizations , stay tuned !
# # List of visualizations available in Power BI
All of these visualizations can be added to Power BI reports , specified in Q &amp; A , and pinned to dashboards .
&gt; The Basic Area chart is based on the line chart with the area between the axis and line filled in .
# # # Bar and column charts
&gt; Bar charts are the standard for looking at a specific value across different categories .
# # # Cards : Multi row
# # # Cards : Single number
&gt; Doughnut charts are similar to Pie charts . They show the relationship of parts to a whole .
&gt; Funnels help visualize a process that has stages and items flow sequentially from one stage to the next . Use a funnel when there is a sequential flow between stages , such as a sales process that starts with leads and ends with purchase fulfillment .
&gt; Displays current status in the context of a goal .
A key influencer chart displays the major contributors to a selected result or value .
&gt; Displays progress toward a measurable goal .
&gt; Emphasize the overall shape of an entire series of values , usually over time .
# # # Maps : Basic maps
&gt; Used to associate both categorical and quantitative information with spatial locations .
# # # Maps : ArcGIS maps
&gt; The more intense the color , the larger the value .
&gt; Compares regions by color .
&gt; Pie charts show the relationship of parts to a whole .
# # # Power Apps visual
# # # Q &amp; A visual
# # # R script visuals
&gt; Too many data points on a visual can bog it down , so a sophisticated sampling algorithm is used to ensure the accuracy of the visualization .
&gt; Work well with quantitative comparisons among items where there are many categories .
&gt; Are charts of colored rectangles , with size representing value . They can be hierarchical , with rectangles nested within the main rectangles .
&gt; Waterfall charts show a running total as values are added or subtracted .
# # Tell Q &amp; A which visualization to use
When typing natural language queries with Power BI Q &amp; A , you can specify the visualization type in your query . For example :
If your dashboard doesn &apos;t have a Q &amp; A field , it may have been disabled by your tenant administrator .

* You can only embed reports and dashboards for this scenario .
The .ini file contains configuration information required by CommonCryptoLib to enable SSO in the gateway scenario .
The sapcrypto .dll and .ini files must exist in the same location . In the above example , sapcrypto.ini and sapcrypto.dll are both located on the desktop .
The first variable sets the trace level and the second variable sets the trace file directory . The directory must be a location that members of the Authenticated Users group can write to .
CPIC tracing can diagnose higher level issues such as a failure to load the sapcrypto.dll library . For example , here is a snippet from a CPIC trace file where a .dll load error occured :
1 . Turn on CommonCryptoLib tracing by adding these lines to the sapcrypto.ini file you created earlier :
5 . When you &apos;re finished , turn off CPIC and CCL tracing .

title : Dashboard data classification
# # Data classification tags
Data classification tags show up next to the dashboard name , letting anyone viewing it know the level of security that should be applied to the dashboard and the data it contains .
It will also show up next to the dashboard tile in your Favorites list .
When you hover over the tag , you will see the full name of the classification .
Admins can also set an URL for a tag to provide additional information .
# # Setting a dashboard ’ s classification
If data classification is turned on for your company , all dashboards start out with a default classification type , but as a dashboard owner , you can change the classification to match your dashboards security level .
To change the classification type , do the following :
2 . Under Dashboard settings , you will be able to see the current classification for your dashboard and use the drop down to change the classification type .
After you apply the change , anyone you shared with will see the update the next time they reload the dashboard .
# # Working with data classification tags as an admin
Data classification is set up by the global admin for your organization . To turn data classification on , do the following :
Once turned on , you will be presented with a form to create the various classifications in your organization .
&gt; There are a few important things to remember when you come back to make changes :
&gt; * If you turn data classification off , none of the tags are remembered . You will need to start over if you decide to turn it back on later .
&gt; * If you remove a classification type , any dashboards assigned the removed classification type will be assigned back to the default until the owner goes and sets it again .
&gt; * If you change the default , all dashboards that weren ’ t already assigned a classification type by the owner will change to the new default .
title : Table visualizations in Power BI reports and dashboards
# Tables in Power BI reports and dashboards
Create tables in reports and cross-highlight elements within the table with other visuals on the same report page . You can select rows , columns , and even individual cells and cross-highlight . You can also copy and paste individual cells and multiple cell selections into other applications .
# # When to use a table
Tables are a great choice :
* To see and compare detailed data and exact values ( instead of visual representations ) .
* To display data in a tabular format .
* To display numerical data by categories .
You &apos;ll create the table pictured at the beginning of the article to display sales values by item category .
Power BI automatically creates a table that lists all the categories .
* Try formatting the table grid . Here you &apos;ll add a blue vertical grid , add space to the rows , and increase the outline and text size .
* For the column headers , change the background color , add an outline , and increase the font size .
* After some additional formatting , here is our final table .
Data bars replace the numerical values in the table , making it easier to scan .
# # Copy values from Power BI tables for use in other applications
1 . Select the cell you want to copy .
1 . Right-click inside the cell .
With the unformatted cell value on your clipboard , you can paste it into another application .
To copy more than a single cell :
1 . Right-click inside one of the cells you selected .
# # Adjust the column width of a table
* If the text data in your table &apos;s cells or headers contain new line characters , those characters will be ignored unless you toggle on the &apos; Word Wrap &apos; option in the element &apos;s associated formatting pane card .
title : Create a QR code for a tile to use in Power BI mobile apps
QR codes in Power BI can connect anything in the real world directly to related BI information &amp; # 151 ; no navigation or search needed .
# # Create a QR code for a tile
4 . A dialog box with the QR code appears .
5 . From here you can scan the QR code or download and save it so you can :
* Add it to an email or other document , or
* Print it and place it in a specific location .
# # Print the QR code
Power BI generates the QR code as a JPG file , ready to print .
2 . Print the file at 100 % or “ actual size ” .
3 . Cut out the QR code and glue it to a place relevant to the tile .

title : Key influencers visualizations tutorial
# # When to use key influencers
The key influencers visual is a great choice if you want to :
- See which factors affect the metric being analyzed .
- Contrast the relative importance of these factors . For example , do short-term contracts have more impact on churn than long-term contracts ?
# # Features of the key influencers visual
# # Analyze a metric that is categorical
Watch this video to learn how to create a key influencers visual with a categorical metric . Then follow these steps to create one .
&gt; This video uses an earlier version of Power BI Desktop .
- Role in Org
Later in the tutorial , you look at more complex examples that have one-to-many relationships . In those cases , the columns have to first be aggregated down to the customer level before you can run the analysis .
Let &apos;s take a look at the key influencers for low ratings .
# # # Top single factor that influences the likelihood of a low rating
- 14.93 % of consumers give a low score .
- On average , all other roles give a low score 5.78 % of the time .
- Consumers are 2.57 times more likely to give a low score compared to all other roles . You can determine this by dividing the green bar by the red dotted line .
# # # Second single factor that influences the likelihood of a low rating
The second most important factor is related to the theme of the customer ’ s review . Customers who commented about the usability of the product were 2.55 times more likely to give a low score compared to customers who commented on other themes , such as reliability , design , or speed .
# # Interact with other visuals
In some cases you may find that your continuous factors were automatically turned into categorical ones . This is because we realized the relationship between the variables is not linear and so we cannot describe the relationship as simply increasing or decreasing ( like we did in the example above ) .
# # Interpret measures and aggregates as key influencers
You can use measures and aggregates as explanatory factors inside your analysis . For example , you might want to see what effect the count of customer support tickets or the average duration of an open ticket has on the score you receive .
# # Interpret the results : Top segments
You can turn counts on through the * * Analysis card * * of the formatting pane .
# # Analyze a metric that is numeric
This distinction is very helpful when you have lots of unique values in the field you are analyzing . In the example below we look at house prices . It is not very meaningful to ask ‘ What influences House Price to be 156,214 ? ’ as that is very specific and we are likely not to have enough data to infer a pattern .
Instead we may want to ask , ‘ What influences House Price to increase ’ ? which allows us to treat house prices as a range rather than distinct values .
# # Interpret the results : Key influencers
In the example below we look at our top influencer which is kitchen quality being Excellent . The results are very similar to the ones we saw when we were analyzing categorical metrics with a few important differences :
In the example below we are looking at the impact a continuous factor ( year house was remodeled ) has on house price . The differences compared to how we analyze continuous influencers for categorical metrics are as follows :
- The scatter plot in the right pane plots the average house price for each distinct value of year remodeled .
Finally , in the case of measures we are looking at the average year a house was built . The analysis here is as follows :
- The scatterplot in the right pane plots the average house price for each distinct value in the table
# # Interpret the results : Top Segments
# # Analyze a metric that is a measure or a summarized column
If you would like to learn more about how you can analyze measures with the key influencers visualization please watch the following tutorial .
* * What are the limitations for the visual ? * *
The key influencers visual has some limitations :
- Publish to web is not supported
- SharePoint Online embedding isn &apos;t supported
- Your explanatory factors have enough observations to generalize , but the visualization didn &apos;t find any meaningful correlations to report .
When analyzing a numeric or categorical column , the analysis always runs at the table level . For example , if you are analyzing house prices and your table contains an ID column , the analysis will automatically run at the house ID level .
If you have a related table that &apos;s defined at a more granular level than the table that contains your metric , you see this error . Here &apos;s an example :
- You analyze what drives customers to give low ratings of your service .
- You want to see if the device on which the customer is consuming your service influences the reviews they give .
- A customer can consume the service in multiple different ways .
- In the following example , customer 10000000 uses both a browser and a tablet to interact with the service .
If you try to use the device column as an explanatory factor , you see the following error :
- You can change the summarization of devices to count . For example , use count if the number of devices might affect the score that a customer gives .
- You can pivot the device column to see if consuming the service on a specific device influences a customer ’ s rating .
The analysis runs on the table level of the field that &apos;s being analyzed . If you analyze customer churn , you might have a table that tells you whether a customer churned or not . In this case , your analysis runs at the customer table level .
Measures and aggregates are by default analyzed at the table level . If there were a measure for average monthly spending , it would be analyzed at the customer table level .
We run the analysis on a sample of 10,000 data points . The bubbles on the one side show all the influencers that were found . The column charts and scatterplots on the other side abide by the sampling strategies for those core visuals .
For example , if we are analyzing house prices , a linear regression will look at the impact having an excellent kitchen will have on the house price . Do houses with excellent kitchens generally have lower or higher house prices compared to houses without excellent kitchens ?
- By itself , more bedrooms might be a driver for house prices to be high .
- Including house size in the analysis means you now look at what happens to bedrooms while house size remains constant .
- If house size is fixed at 1,500 square feet , it &apos;s unlikely that a continuous increase in the number of bedrooms will dramatically increase the house price .

However , while these functions can be helpful and can contribute to writing easy-to-understand expressions , they can also significantly degrade the performance of calculations . It can happen because these functions increase the number of storage engine scans required .
Most evaluation-time errors are due to unexpected BLANKs or zero values , or invalid data type conversion .
It &apos;s better to avoid using the ISERROR and IFERROR functions . Instead , apply defensive strategies when developing the model and writing expressions . Strategies can include :
The following measure expression tests whether an error would be raised . It returns BLANK in this instance ( which is the case when you do not provide the IF function with a value-if-false expression ) .
This next version of the measure expression has been improved by using the IFERROR function in place of the IF and ISERROR functions .
However , this final version of the measure expression achieves the same outcome , yet more efficiently and elegantly .

When drilling with geo-hierarchies , it is important to know how each drill button works and what gets sent to Bing Maps .
title : Troubleshooting scheduled refresh for Azure SQL Databases
# Troubleshooting scheduled refresh for Azure SQL Databases in Power BI
1 . Go to the Azure SQL database for which you &apos;re configuring refresh .
# Data types in Power BI Desktop
# # Determine and specify a column ’ s data type
* * Data types in Query Editor * *
* * Data types in Data View or Report View * *
# # # Date / time types
# # # True / false type
# # # Blanks / nulls type
# # # Binary data type
&gt; If a binary column is in the output of the steps of a query , attempting to refresh the data through a gateway can cause errors . It &apos;s recommended that you explicitly remove any binary columns as the last step in your queries .
# # # Table data type
# # Implicit and explicit data type conversion in DAX formulas
* You can type a date as a string , and DAX will parse the string and attempt to cast it as one of the Windows date and time formats .
# # # Table of implicit data conversions
The type of conversion that is performed is determined by the operator , which casts the values it requires before performing the requested operation . These tables list the operators , and indicate the conversion that is performed on each data type in the column when it is paired with the data type in the intersecting row .
For example , if a date is used in a subtraction operation with any other data type , both values are converted to dates , and the return value is also a date .
For example , if an integer is combined with a real number in a multiplication operation , both numbers are converted to real numbers , and the return value is also REAL .
In the following table , the row header is the numerator and the column header is the denominator .
For example , if an integer is combined with a currency value in a division operation , both values are converted to real numbers , and the result is also a real number .
The following DAX expressions illustrate this behavior :
Conversions are performed implicitly for numeric or date / time types as described in the following table :
# # # Handling blanks , empty strings , and zero values
How blanks are handled in operations such as addition or concatenation depends on the individual function . The following table summarizes the differences between DAX and Microsoft Excel formulas , in the way that blanks are handled .
&#124; FALSE OR BLANK &#124; FALSE &#124; FALSE &#124;
&#124; FALSE AND BLANK &#124; FALSE &#124; FALSE &#124;
&#124; TRUE OR BLANK &#124; TRUE &#124; TRUE &#124;
&#124; TRUE AND BLANK &#124; FALSE &#124; TRUE &#124;
&#124; BLANK OR BLANK &#124; BLANK &#124; Error &#124;
&#124; BLANK AND BLANK &#124; BLANK &#124; Error &#124;
title : Data analyst learning catalog
Do you use Power BI to help your organization analyze data , and create reports and dashboards for your organization ?
title : Create a matrix visual in Power BI
# Create matrix visualizations in Power BI
There are many features associated with the matrix , and we &apos;ll go through them in the following sections of this article .
Take a look at the following matrix visuals .
When you look at totals and subtotals , remember that those values are based on the underlying data . They aren &apos;t solely based on the visible values .
# # Expanding and collapsing row headers
Once the icons are turned on , they work similar to PivotTable icons in Excel .
The expansion state of the matrix will save with your report . A matrix can be pinned to a dashboard expanded or collapsed . When that dashboard tile is selected , and the report opens , the expansion state can still be changed in the report .
# # Using drill down with the matrix visual
With the matrix visual , you can do all sorts of interesting drill down activities that weren &apos;t available before . This includes the ability to drill down using rows , columns , and even into individual sections and cells . Let &apos;s take a look at how each of these works .
# # # Drill down on row headers
In addition to using those icons , you can select any of those row headers and drill down by choosing from the menu that appears .
Notice there are a few options from the menu that appears , which generate different results :
# # # Drill down on column headers
&gt; The drill down and drill up icons in the upper-left of the matrix visual only apply to rows . In order to drill down on columns , you must use the right-click menu .
# # Stepped layout with matrix visuals
The matrix visual automatically indents subcategories in a hierarchy beneath each parent , called a stepped layout .
In the original version of the matrix visual , subcategories were shown in an entirely different column , taking up much more space in the visual . The following image shows the table in original matrix visual ; notice the subcategories in a separate column .
If you turn off stepped layout , Power BI shows the subcategories in another column rather than indented beneath the parent category .
# # Subtotals and grand totals with matrix visuals
The same process applies for column subtotals .
Add visual cues to your table or matrix with * conditional icons * .
# # Copying values from Power BI for use in other applications
* To copy more than a single cell , select a range of cells or use CTRL to select one or more cells .
* The copy will include the column and row headers .
* The copy will be another matrix visualization , but contain only your copied data .
# # Setting a matrix value as a custom URL
# # Shading and font colors with matrix visuals
With the matrix visual , you can apply conditional formatting ( colors and shading and data bars ) to the background of cells within the matrix , and you can apply conditional formatting to the text and values themselves .
* If the text data in your matrix &apos;s cells or headers contain new line characters , those characters will be ignored unless you toggle on the &apos; Word Wrap &apos; option in the element &apos;s associated formatting pane card .
title : &apos; Power BI app configuration settings&apos;
# Remotely configure Power BI app using mobile device management ( MDM ) tool
The Power BI Mobile app supports the following configuration scenarios :
The Power BI app for iOS and Android allows administrators to remotely &quot; push &quot; the Report Server configuration to enrolled devices .
&gt; Data protection settings will be applied only on Android devices that support biometric authentication .
By default the Power BI mobile app provides a convenient single sign-on experience for a single user by minimizing the number times the user has to provide a username and password . This single sign-on behavior is based on the assumption that the device is the user &apos;s personal device , and that there is only one user who uses the device and the apps on it .
This is an admin-only setting that is configured via remote configuration . The end user cannot change this setting .
The following are the steps you need to create an app configuration policy . Once you &apos;ve created the configuration policy , you can assign its settings to groups of users .
4 . Create key-value pairs for the setting you want to push to your users .
# Configure mobile apps with Microsoft Intune
# # General mobile device management configuration
Save the URL , as you will need it when we create the application .
To get the app URL for iOS , we will need to get it from iTunes .
The mobile application management policy allows you to enforce items like an access pin . You can create one within the Intune portal .
You can create the application , or the policy first . The order in which they are added doesn &apos;t matter . They will just need to both exist for the deploy step .
1 . Edit the policy to configure the restrictions you want on the application .
# # Step 3 : Create the application
# # # Create for iOS
# # # Create for Android
# # Step 4 : Deploy the application
After you have added the application , you will need to deploy it so that it is available to your end users . This is the step where you will bind the policy you created with the app .
# # # Deploy for iOS
# # # Deploy for Android
1 . Open the Company Portal app .
1 . Select the Power BI app that you deployed .

# # Known limitations and issues of the Analytics pane
* Properties of type `integer` aren &apos;t displayed correctly . As a workaround , use type `numeric` instead .
Take the following steps to create a * * Shape Map * * :
You can do interesting things with the individual state maps as well , and show more detail based on the districts it contains .
If you &apos;d like to experiment with this dataset and visualization , you can download the original PBIX file that was used to generate this report using the following link .

title : Set data alerts in the Power BI mobile apps
# Set data alerts in the Power BI mobile apps
You can set alerts on tiles if you have a Power BI Pro license , or if the shared dashboard is in a Premium capacity .
&gt; Data-driven alert notifications provide information about your data . If your device gets stolen , we recommend going to the Power BI service to turn off all data-driven alert rules .
# # Data alerts on an iPhone or iPad
# # # Set an alert on an iPhone or iPad
1 . Tap a number or gauge tile in a dashboard to open it in focus mode .
4 . Choose to receive alerts above or below a value , then set the value .
5 . Decide whether to receive hourly or daily alerts , and whether to also receive an email when you get the alert .
&gt; You don &apos;t receive alerts every hour or every day unless the data has actually refreshed in that time .
6 . You can change the alert title , too .
# # # Manage alerts on your iPhone or iPad
1 . In a dashboard , tap a number or gauge tile that has an alert .
3 . Tap the name of the alert to edit it , tap the slider to turn off email alerts , or tap the garbage can to delete the alert .
# # Data alerts on an Android device
# # # Set an alert on an Android device
1 . In a Power BI dashboard , tap a number or gauge tile to open it .
6 . Decide whether to receive hourly or daily alerts , and whether to also receive an email when you get the alert .
7 . You can change the alert title , too .
# # # Manage alerts on an Android device
1 . In a dashboard , tap a card or gauge tile that has an alert .
3 . Tap the alert to change a value or turn it off .
# # Data alerts on a Windows device
# # # Set data alerts on a Windows device
1 . Tap a number or gauge tile in a dashboard to open it .
7 . Tap the check mark .
# # # Manage alerts on a Windows device
Data sources are often set to refresh daily , although some refresh more often . When the data in the dashboard is refreshed , if the data being tracked reaches one of the thresholds you &apos;ve set , several things will happen .
As long as the data is past the threshold , you &apos;ll get an alert every hour or every 24 hours .
2 . If you &apos;ve set the alert to send you an email , you &apos;ll find something like this in your Inbox .
* Alerts currently aren &apos;t supported for Bing tiles or card tiles with date / time measures .
* Alerts only work with numeric data .
* Alerts only work on data that is refreshed . They don &apos;t work on static data .
* Alerts don &apos;t work with tiles that contain streaming data .

Want to improve quick insights results ? If you are a dataset owner , try these :
* Use a mix of data types such as names , times , dates , and numbers .
title : Use the numeric range slicer in Power BI
# Use the numeric range slicer in Power BI
In this video , Will walks through creating a numeric range slicer .
# # Add a numeric range slicer
Select the down-arrow in the upper-right corner of the numeric range slicer and a menu appears .
For the numeric range , you can select from the following three options :
# # Snap to whole numbers with the numeric range slicer
# # Display formatting with the date range slicer
Displaying the Short Date format in the slicer ensures the length of the string stays consistent and compact within the slicer .
The following limitations and considerations apply to the numeric range slicer :
* It doesn &apos;t currently work with measures .
* You can type any number into a numeric slicer , even if it is outside the range of values in the underlying column . This option lets you set up filters if you know the data may change in future .
title : Add hyperlinks ( URLs ) to a table or matrix
# Add hyperlinks ( URLs ) to a table or matrix
&gt; You can &apos;t create a column in DirectQuery mode . But if your data already contains URLs , you can turn them into hyperlinks .
2 . In Data view or Report view , select the column .
# # Create a table or matrix with a hyperlink
2 . Create a table or matrix with the field that you categorized as a Web URL . The hyperlinks are blue and underlined .
# # Display a hyperlink icon instead of a URL
&gt; You can &apos;t display icons in a matrix .
2 . Select the table to make it active .
# # Format link text as a hyperlink
&gt; You can &apos;t format another field as the hyperlink in a matrix .
2 . In Data view or Report view , select the column that contains the URL .
2 . In Report view , create a table or matrix with the URL column and the column you &apos;re going to format as link text .
Now the text in that column is formatted as the link .
4 . Place your cursor in the column that contains the URLs that you &apos;d like to turn into hyperlinks in Power BI tables .
7 . Create a table visualization that includes the URL field .
URLS must start with one of the following :
Q : Can I use a custom URL as a hyperlink in a table or matrix ?

# Capacity and SKUs in Power BI embedded analytics
&gt; For publishing , you &apos;ll need one Power BI Pro account .
# # What is embedded analytics ?
Power BI embedded analytics includes two solutions :
Power BI Embedded is for ISVs and developers who want to embed visuals into their applications .
To plan and test your capacity , use these links :
# # # Power BI Embedded SKUs
# # # Power BI Premium SKUs
# # # Which SKU should I use ?
The table below provides a summary of features , the capacity they require , and the specific SKU that is needed for each one .
# # # SKU memory and computing power
The table below describes the resources and limits of each SKU .
title : Create a visual with Power BI Q &amp; A
# Create a visual with Power BI Q &amp; A
To follow along , you must use a report that you can edit , so we &apos;ll use one of the samples available with Power BI .
# # Create a visual with Q &amp; A
How would we go about creating this line chart using Q &amp; A ?
2 . In the Q &amp; A box , type something like this question :
* * this year sales and last year sales by month as area chart * *
4 . Select the sentence to accept the suggestion .
When you finish typing your question , the result is the same chart that you see in the dashboard .
# # Create a visual in the report editor
1 . Navigate back to the Retail Analysis Sample dashboard .
You see they ended up with the same visual . Creating it this way wasn &apos;t too complicated . But creating it with Q &amp; A was easier !
# Use report themes in Power BI Desktop
There are two types of report themes : built-in report themes and custom report theme files .
Let &apos;s discuss how report themes work , then jump into how to create customized report themes .
# # How report themes work
To apply a report theme to a Power BI Desktop report , you can select from the following options :
We &apos;ll take a look at each of these options in turn .
# # # Built-in report themes
To select from the available built-in report themes :
2 . Select from among the included themes from the drop-down menu that appears .
Your report theme is now applied to the report .
The following table shows the available built-in report themes .
&#124; Built-in report theme &#124; Default color sequence &#124;
From the gallery , you can select a theme you like and download its associated JSON file .
When successful , Power BI shows a dialog that the import was successful .
The two ways to customize report themes are the following :
Let &apos;s take a look at each of these approaches , in turn , in the following sections .
2 . A dialog appears , where you can make all sorts of changes to the current theme , and then , can save your settings as a new theme .
# # # Import custom report theme files
You can also import a custom report theme file , by taking the following steps :
A window appears that lets you browse to the location of the JSON theme file .
When the theme file has loaded successfully , Power BI Desktop displays a success message .
# # Introduction to report theme JSON files
This report theme JSON file has the following lines :
You can use this JSON file as a basis to create your own custom report theme file to import . If you want to adjust only the basic colors of your report , change the name and hex codes in the file .
# # How report theme colors stick with your reports
To view the available colors in a report theme :
1 . Select a visual .
In our example , after you apply the multitude of green and brown colors from the St. Patrick &apos;s Day report theme , view the theme colors . See all that green ? That &apos;s because those colors were part of the report theme that we imported and applied .
# # # Situations when report theme colors won &apos;t stick to your reports
Many Power BI visuals won &apos;t apply to report themes .
# # Custom report theme files you can use right now
- Valentine &apos;s Day theme .
Here &apos;s the code for the Valentine &apos;s Day JSON file :
Here are a few more report themes you can use as starting points :
Report themes can make your Power BI Desktop reports a colorful reflection of you , your organization , or even the current season or holiday .
To export the currently applied theme from Power BI Desktop :
# # Report theme JSON file format
# # # Setting theme colors
A basic theme that defines these colors might appear as follows :
# # # Setting structural colors
&#124; Color class &#124; What it formats &#124;
Here &apos;s a sample theme that sets the color classes :
# # # Setting formatted text defaults
- Each of the four primary text classes , what it formats , and its default settings
- Each secondary class , what it formats , and its default setting that &apos;s unique compared to the primary class
* \ * Starred items are also colored based on the first data color of the report theme . *
Here &apos;s an example theme that sets only the primary text classes :
Here &apos;s an example that sets a few properties through the visual styles :
This example makes the following settings :
- Turns on word wrap everywhere
- Sets the gridline style to dotted for all visuals with a category axis
- Sets the bubble size for scatter charts to -10 .
&gt; You need only specify the formatting elements you want to adjust . Any formatting elements that aren &apos;t included in the JSON file revert to their default values and settings .
# # # `visualStyles` definition list
# # # Properties within each card
Booleans are either true or false . Strings must be in double quotes , as in &quot; this is a string &quot; . Numbers are just the value itself , not in quotes .
Colors use the following format , where your custom hexadecimal code replaces &quot; FFFFFF &quot; is in the following example :
# # # Enumerations in the JSON file
The following section defines the enumerations that you can use in the JSON file .
If you &apos;re using one of our original themes , the &quot; Classic &quot; theme , or a custom theme that you imported on top of one of these , the text section of the theme dialog box isn &apos;t available for configuring .
Built-in themes that are affected by this limitation include the following themes :
* Colorblind safe
- The quickest and easiest way to enable the text classes is to select the Default theme options .
- If you want to keep your current custom theme , to enable the text tab :
1 . Export your current theme .
1 . Select the default theme .
1 . Import the custom theme you exported in the first step .
The text in your report will look different , but you will be able to access the text tab in the theme dialog box .

title : Monitor usage metrics in the new workspace experience ( preview )
# Monitor usage metrics in the new workspace experience ( preview )
# # Create &amp; view an improved usage metrics report
1 . Open the workspace that contains the report for which you want to analyze the usage metrics .
&gt; You can only see the New usage report switch if your report resides in a modern workspace . Legacy workspaces do not offer improved usage metrics reports .
# # About the improved usage metrics report
# # # Usage metrics report dataset
&gt; While still in preview , the usage metrics dataset may have minor changes which affect custom reports .
# # # Usage metrics report pages
The improved usage metrics report includes the following report pages :
# # # Which metrics are reported ?
&#124; Report usage &#124; Users with report views &#124; Shows the list of users who opened the report sorted by view count . &#124;
# # Update usage metrics report credentials
Use the following procedure to take over a Usage Metrics Report dataset and update the credentials .
1 . Open the workspace that contains the report for which you want to update the Usage Metrics Report dataset .
1 . Select the Usage Metrics Report dataset .
If you aren &apos;t the current dataset owner , you must take over ownership before you can update the data source credentials .
1 . Complete the sign-in sequence and note the notification that the data source was updated successfully .
# # Disable usage metrics reports
&gt; Only admins for the Power BI tenant can see the Admin portal and edit settings .
# # Exclude user information from usage metrics reports
# # Customize the usage metrics report
To dig into the report data , or to build your own reports against the underlying dataset , you have several options :
# # # Create a copy of the usage report
For example , you can change filters , add new pages , and build new visualizations , format the fonts and colors , etc .
1 . The new report is saved to the Reports tab in the current workspace and added to the Recent content list .
1 . Scroll to the desired dataset or type * Usage Metrics Report * in the search box .
1 . Now you can create and share custom usage reports , all from the same Usage Metrics Report dataset .
# # # Analyze usage data in Excel
# # Usage metrics in national clouds
In addition to the above differences between previous and improved usage metrics reports , note the following limitations for the preview release :
- Dashboard usage metrics still rely on the previous version of the usage metrics reports .
- Improved usage metrics reports are only available for reports in modern workspaces . Reports in legacy workspaces only support the previous version of the usage metrics reports .
- Initializing the Usage Metrics Report dataset might fail due to a timeout encountered during refresh . Refer to the Troubleshooting section below to resolve this issue .
- Sharing is disabled for the usage metrics report . To give people read access to the report , you first need to give them access to the workspace .
- In some scenarios you may notice the performance data is missing . This can occur if a user opens a report and interacts with the report before it has completed loading or if an error occured during the report load .
In addition to the above considerations and limitations , the following questions and answers about usage metrics might be helpful for users and administrators :
Note that the definition of a view differs from previous usage metrics reports . Changing report pages is no longer considered an additional view .
# # Troubleshoot : Delete the dataset
If you suspect data consistency or refresh issues , it might make sense to delete the existing Usage Metrics Report dataset . Then you can run View Usage Metrics again to generate a new dataset with its associated improved usage metrics reports . Follow these steps .
1 . Open the workspace that contains the report for which you want to reset the Usage Metrics Report dataset .
5 . Copy the workspace and dataset IDs from the URL displayed in the address bar of your browser .
# # # Create a fresh usage metrics report
1 . Back in the Power BI service , you see the dataset is gone .
2 . If you still see the Usage Metrics report in the Reports list , refresh your browser .

1 . Execute the following command :
# # Get the certificate signed
1 . Restart the HANA server .
1 . Verify the trust relationship between a client and the CA you used to sign the SAP HANA server &apos;s certificate .
The client must trust the CA used to sign the HANA server &apos;s X509 certificate before an encrypted connection can be made to the HANA server from the client &apos;s machine .
You must first convert trust.pem into a .crt file before you can import the certificate into the Trusted Root Certification Authorities folder , for example by executing the following OpenSSL command :

# # Find your Power BI administrator
Established organizations usually already have a Power BI administrator . People in any of the following roles can act as a Power BI administrator :
- Global administrators
- Users with the Power BI service admin role in Azure Active Directory
- Reports using row-level security .
- Reports in a workspace in which you aren &apos;t an edit member .
- Exporting data from visuals in a report that has been published to the web .
- Reports containing report-level DAX measures .
- Single sign-on data query models .
- Secure confidential or proprietary information .
To create a new visual , navigate to the directory you want the Power BI visual to reside in , and run the command :
Running this command creates a Power BI visual folder that contains the following files :
# # Folder and file description
This folder contains the VS code project settings .
To configure your workspace , edit the `.vscode / settings.json` file .
This folder contains the `icon.png` file .
The Power BI visuals tool uses this file as the new Power BI visual icon in the Power BI visualization pane .
This folder contains the visual &apos;s source code .
In this folder , the Power BI visuals tool creates the following files :
* `visual.ts` - The visual &apos;s main source code .
This folder contains the `visual.less` file , which holds the visual &apos;s styles .
This file describes the project package . It contains information about the project such as authors , description , and project dependencies .
This file contains the visual metadata .
The comments in the following code caption from the `pbiviz.json` file , describe the metadata entries .
Generally , we recommend minimizing the use of bi-directional relationships . They can negatively impact on model query performance , and possibly deliver confusing experiences for your report users .
There are three scenarios when bi-directional filtering can solve specific requirements :
Bi-directional relationships play an important role when creating the following two special model relationship types :
# # Slicer items &quot; with data &quot;
To help describe how bi-directional filtering works , the model diagram has been modified to reveal the table rows . All examples in this article are based on this data .
The row details for the three tables are described in the following bulleted list :
Now consider the following report page .
We first suggest you consider carefully whether this design works for your report users . Some report users find the experience confusing . They don &apos;t understand why slicer items dynamically appear or disappear when they interact with other slicers .
If you do decide to show slicer items &quot; with data &quot; , we don &apos;t recommend you configure bi-directional relationships . Bi-directional relationships require more processing and so they can negatively impact on query performance — especially as the number of bi-directional relationships in your model increases .
A different scenario involving bi-directional relationships treats a fact-type table like a bridging table . This way , it supports analyzing dimension-type table data within the filter context of a different dimension-type table .
Using the example model in this article , consider how the following questions can be answered :
- How many colors were sold to Australian customers ?
title : Monitor usage metrics for dashboards and reports
# Monitor usage metrics for Power BI dashboards and reports
# # Why usage metrics are important
- To access usage metrics for a particular dashboard or report , you must have edit access to that dashboard or report .
# # View a Usage Metrics report
1 . Start in the workspace that contains the dashboard or report .
&gt; If you pin a tile from a usage metrics report to a dashboard , you can &apos;t add that dashboard to an app .
# # # Report Usage Metrics report
# # About the Usage Metrics report
To dig into the report data , or to build your own reports against the underlying dataset , you have two options :
# # Which metrics are reported ?
# # Save a copy of the Usage Metrics report
# # See * all * workspace usage metrics
Now your report displays metrics for the entire workspace .
# # Power BI admin controls for usage metrics
# # # Discrepancies between audit logs and usage metrics
* Usage metrics may sometimes undercount activities due to inconsistent network connections , ad blockers , or other issues that can disrupt sending the events from the client .

title : Creating reports in Power BI using accessibility tools
# Creating reports in Power BI using accessibility tools
For report creators who use accessibility tools to create reports , Power BI has many built-in capabilities that can help in the process .
This article describes the many types of accessibility tools available for report creators in Power BI Desktop .
4 . View navigator
6 . Sign in
7 . Yellow warning / error / updates bar
1 . The header title
2 . The expand / collapse carat
3 . The first visual icon
After the visuals section of the pane , the focus order then shifts to the pane pivots , as shown in the following image .
When focus is on the pane pivots , tabbing lands only on the icon for the pane that is selected . To switch to other panes , use arrow keys .
In the * * Field well * * , focus order moves to :
* each well &apos;s title ( first )
* followed by a given field in each well ( next )
* the dropdown button to open the field menu ( after that )
* then the removal button ( last )
The following image shows this focus progression ordering .
2 . The search bar
3 . Each table name
The * * Selection * * pane has the following focus order progression :
3 . Layer / tab order switcher
4 . Move up in layer button
You can tab through the focus order and press * * Enter * * to select the element you &apos;re interested in .
When you get to the layer / tab order switcher , use the left and right arrow keys to switch between the layer order and tab order .
Once you ’ ve navigated to an object of interest , there are a few different actions you can take :
All dialogs in Power BI Desktop are accessible through keyboard navigation and work with screen readers .
Dialogs in Power BI Desktop include the following :
* Quick Measures dialog
* Conditional Formatting &amp; data bars dialog
* Q &amp; A Explorer dialog
* Getting Started dialog
* File menu and About dialog
* File Restore dialog
* Frowns dialog

# Monitor report performance in Power BI
Monitoring performance is relevant in the following situations :
- Your Import data model refresh is slow .
- Your DirectQuery or Live Connection reports are slow .
- Your model calculations are slow .
Slow queries or report visuals should be a focal point of continued optimization .
Use SQL Server Profiler when your data source is either :
To create a SQL Server Profiler trace , follow these instructions :
title : Types of Insights supported by Power BI
# Types of insights supported by Power BI
# # How does Insights work ?
# # What types of insights can you find ?
These are the algorithms that Power BI uses .
Highlights cases where one or two categories have much larger values than other categories .
# # # Change points in a time series
Highlights when there are significant changes in trends in a time series of data .
Detects cases where multiple measures show a similar pattern or trend when plotted against a category or value in the dataset .
# # # Majority ( Major factors )
Finds cases where a majority of a total value can be attributed to a single factor when broken down by another dimension .
# # # Overall trends in time series
Detects upward or downward trends in time series data .
# # # Seasonality in time series
Finds periodic patterns in time series data , such as weekly , monthly , or yearly seasonality .
# # # Time series outliers
For data across a time series , detects when there are specific dates or times with values significantly different than the other date / time values .
# # Working with the report Filters pane
# # View all the filters for a report page
Anyone viewing this report can interact with these filters .
# # # View only those filters applied to a visual
Here are the types of filters this view can display :
- Advanced filters
- Relative Date filters
- Include / Exclude filters
- Filters passed through a URL
In this example :
Sometimes a filter can have a long list of values . Use the search box to find and select the value you want .
# # # Display filter details
To understand a filter , take a look at the available values and counts . View the details of the filter by hovering and selecting the arrow next to the filter name .
# # # Change filter selections
&gt; To select more than one filter value at a time , hold down the CTRL key . Most filters support multi-select .
# # # Reset filter to default
Learn how and why &#91; visuals cross-filter and cross-highlight each other on a report page &#93; ( end-user-interactions.md )
The following pictures show simple reports with a table , matrix , or list .
You can initially hide detail or grouped data , and include drilldown toggles to enable a user to interactively choose how much data to show .
You can also include drilldown toggles that initially hide detail data ; the user can then click the toggles to display more or less detail as needed .
When you add tables or matrixes to your report , you can use the Table and Matrix Wizard or build them manually from the templates that Report Builder provides . Lists are built manually from the list template .
# Configure Multi-Geo support for Power BI Premium
You see this message to confirm the change .
You don &apos;t need to reset the gateway credentials during a migration at this time . After they &apos;re stored in the Premium capacity region , you will need to reset them upon migration .
During migration , certain operations may fail , such as publishing new datasets or scheduled data refresh .
The following items are stored in the Premium region when Multi-Geo is enabled :
- Models ( .ABF files ) for import and Direct Query datasets
- Query cache
These items remain in the home region for the tenant :
- Dashboard / report metadata : e.g. , tile names , tile queries
- Service buses for gateway queries or scheduled refresh jobs
In the Admin Portal , you can view all the capacities for your Power BI tenant and the regions where they &apos;re currently located .
# # Change the region for existing content
If you need to change the region for existing content , you have two options .
- Create a second capacity and move workspaces . Free users won &apos;t experience any downtime as long as the tenant has spare v-cores .
# # Move content out of Multi-Geo
You can take workspaces out of Multi-Geo capacity in one of two ways :
- Delete the current capacity where the workspace is located . This moves the workspace back to shared capacity in the home region .
- Confirm that any movement you initiate between regions follows all corporate and government compliance requirements prior to initiating data transfer .
title : &quot; Tutorial : Get started creating in the Power BI service &quot;
# Tutorial : Get started creating in the Power BI service
In this tutorial , you complete the following steps :
&gt; * Get some data and open it in report view .
&gt; * Use that data to create visualizations and save it as a report .
&gt; * Create a dashboard by pinning tiles from the report .
&gt; * Add other visualizations to your dashboard by using the Q &amp; A natural-language tool .
&gt; * Clean up resources by deleting the dataset , report , and dashboard .
# # Step 1 : Get data
1. open the report editor .
&gt; Select the global navigation button in the upper-left corner to collapse the navigation pane . That way your canvas has more room .
Power BI analyzes the data and creates a column chart visualization .
Some fields have sigma symbols next to them because Power BI detected that they contain numeric values .
Now you &apos;re looking at the report in Reading view .
A success message ( near the top-right corner ) lets you know the visualization was added as a tile to your dashboard .
Back in Editing view , you can continue to explore and pin tiles .
# # Step 3 : Explore with Q &amp; A
Q &amp; A searches for an answer and presents it in the form of a * card * visualization .
1 . On the dashboard , select the map you just pinned . See how it opens Q &amp; A again ?
1 . Pin the bar chart to your Financial Sample dashboard , too .
You see that even though you changed the map to a bar chart in Q &amp; A , that tile remained a map because it was a map when you pinned it .
# # Step 4 : Reposition tiles
We can rearrange the tiles to make better use of the dashboard space .
Now the two tiles are the same height .
1 . Rearrange the other visuals to fit together .
That looks better .
Now that you &apos;ve finished the tutorial , you can delete the dataset , report , and dashboard .
By default , row-level security filtering uses single-directional filters , regardless of whether the relationships are set to single direction or bidirectional . You can manually enable bidirectional cross-filter with row-level security .
Here are the current limitations for row-level security on Power BI models .
If you &apos;re using integrated security with DirectQuery , then your users may notice :
- RLS is disabled and all data is returned .
- Users can &apos;t update their role assignments , and get an error on the RLS Manage page .
- For the DAX username function , you continue to receive the username as DOMAIN \ USER .
Report authors don &apos;t have access to view the report data in Power BI Report Server until they &apos;ve assigned themselves roles accordingly after uploading the report .
# # # Can I use RLS to limit the columns or measures accessible by my users ?
No , you secure individual rows of data but users can always see either the details or the summarized data .
title : Connect to AI Insights in Power BI Desktop
# # How to enable AI Insights
# # Using Text Analytics and Vision
The services that are supported today are the following :
The transformations are executed on the Power BI service and do not require an Azure Cognitive Services subscription .
&gt; Using the Text Analytics or Vision features requires Power BI Premium .
# # # Enabling Text Analytics and Vision on Premium capacities
This section describes the available functions in Cognitive Services in Power BI .
# # # # Detect language
# # # # Extract key phrases
# # # # Score sentiment
# # # # Tag images
# # # Invoking Text Analytics or Vision functions in Power Query
After signing in , select the function you want to use and the data column you want to transform in the pop-up window .
The first time you use AI Insights on a new data source , you &apos;re prompted to set the privacy level of your data .
&gt; Refreshes of the dataset in Power BI will only work for data sources where the privacy level is set to public or organizational .
After invoking the function , the result is added as a new column to the table . The transformation is also added as an applied step in the query .
In the cases of image tagging and key phrase extraction , the results can return multiple values . Each individual result is returned on a duplicate of the original row .
# # # Publishing a report with Text Analytics or Vision functions
Reports with applied Text Analytics and Vision functions should be published to a workspace that is not on a Premium capacity , otherwise refreshing the dataset will fail .
The following sections describe how you can manage the impacts of Text Analytics and Vision on capacity .
Report authors can select which Premium capacity on which to run AI Insights . By default , Power BI selects the first created capacity to which the user has access .
# # # Considerations and limitations of Text Analytics
There are a few considerations and limitations to keep in mind when using Text Analytics .
* Incremental refresh is supported but can cause performance issues when used on queries with AI insights .
* Direct Query is not supported .
To learn more about Azure Machine Learning , see the following articles :
# # # Granting access to an Azure ML model
3 . Select your subscription
# # # Schema discovery for Machine Learning models
# # # Considerations and limitations of Azure ML
* Lots of other rectangles for all the other clothing sold .
You could compare the number of items sold across the other clothing categories by comparing the size and shading of each leaf node ; larger and darker rectangles mean higher value .
# # When to use a treemap
Treemaps are a great choice :
* To display large amounts of hierarchical data .
* When a bar chart can &apos;t effectively handle the large number of values .
* To show the proportions between each part and the whole .
* To show the pattern of the distribution of the measure across each level of categories in the hierarchy .
* To spot patterns , outliers , most-important contributors , and exceptions .
# # Create a basic treemap
You &apos;ll create a report and add a basic treemap .
&gt; Color Saturation and Details cannot be used at the same time .
# # Export data from a visual
And just like with a dashboard , you can export data from a visual within a report , too , by selecting the export button on a visual .
You can use a measure like any other table column : just drag and drop it onto the report canvas or visualization fields . Measures also integrate seamlessly with slicers , segmenting your data on the fly , which means you can define a measure once , and use it in many different visualizations .
title : Export entire reports to PowerPoint
* Each page in the Power BI report becomes an individual slide in PowerPoint .
* Each page in the Power BI report is exported as a single high-resolution image in PowerPoint .
* You can preserve the filters and slicers settings that you added to the report .
* A link is created in PowerPoint that links to the Power BI report .
# # Export your Power BI report to PowerPoint
# # Open the PowerPoint file
3 . Each report page is a separate slide , as shown in the nav pane .
When you view an individual slide , you see that each report page is an independent image . Scrolling in PowerPoint is not available since each slide is a static image .
What you do with your PowerPoint deck from there , or any of the high-resolution images , is up to you .
* When exporting to PowerPoint , if the report uses a custom font , that font will be replaced with a default font .
* The following visual types are not supported , and will not be exported to PowerPoint :
- Background images are cropped with the chart &apos;s bounding area . We recommend that you remove background images before you export to PowerPoint .
* Some reports cannot be exported . These include :
- Reports with more than 50 report pages . Only the first 50 pages will be exported .
- Reports being exported to older versions of PowerPoint .
- Reports that take longer than an hour to process .
- Report pages that take longer than 6 minutes to load .
# Export the data that was used to create a visualization
# # Export data from a report
# # # Create a stacked column chart
Now we &apos;re ready to try out both options for exporting data .
- This screenshot shows you only a small portion of the Excel file ; it has more than 100,000 rows .
# # Customize the export data user experience
- Power BI administrators can turn off some or all data export options for their organization .
# # Protect data when it is exported out of Power BI
# # Export underlying data details
&#124; Visual contains &#124; What you &apos;ll see in export &#124;
&#124; Measures only &#124; all non-hidden columns from all related tables ( to expand the measure ) &#124;
# # # Set the export options
Power BI report designers control the types of data export options that are available for their consumers . The choices are :
- Don &apos;t allow end users to export any data from the service or Report Server
&gt; We recommend that report designers revisit old reports and manually reset the export option as needed .
To set these options :
You can also update this setting in the Power BI service .
- Export using * Underlying data * won &apos;t work if :
- the version is older than 2016 .
- the tables in the model don &apos;t have a unique key .
- an administrator or report designer has disabled this feature .
- There are too many columns . Try reducing the number of columns and exporting again .
- There &apos;s data that is difficult to compress .
- Other factors are at play that increase file size and decrease the number of rows Power BI can export .
- Power BI visuals and R visuals aren &apos;t currently supported .
- Power BI admins can disable the export of data .

title : &apos; Protect Power BI data with device native identification&apos;
In many cases , the data managed in Power BI is confidential and needs to be protected and accessed by authorized users only .
When this setting is turned on , every time you launch the app or bring it to the foreground , it will ask you to provide your ID before you can access the app .
The image below shows the fingerprint authentication screen .

# Connect to SSAS multidimensional models in Power BI Desktop
# # Capabilities and features of SSAS MD
The following sections describe features and capabilities of Power BI and SSAS MD connections .
# # # Tabular metadata of multidimensional models
&#124; BISM-Multidimentional object &#124; Tabular Metadata &#124;
&#124; Measures without associated measure group &#124; Within table called * Measures * &#124;
&#124; Measure group - &gt; Cube dimension relationship &#124; Relationship &#124;
# # # Measures , measure groups , and KPIs
# # # Dimension attribute type
# # # Dimension calculated members
* Calculated members on attribute hierarchies that aren &apos;t siblings of * All *
* Calculated members on user hierarchies
Multidimensional models expose * calculated members on attribute hierarchies * as values of a column . You have a few additional options and constraints if you expose this type of calculated member :
* A dimension attribute can have an optional * UnknownMember * .
* An attribute containing calculated members can &apos;t be the key attribute of the dimension unless it &apos;s the only attribute of the dimension .
* An attribute containing calculated members can &apos;t be a parent-child attribute .
The calculated members of user hierarchies aren &apos;t exposed in Power BI . You can instead connect to a cube that contains calculated members on user hierarchies . However , you &apos;ll be unable to see calculated members if they don &apos;t meet the constraints that we mentioned in the previous bulleted list .
There are certain limitations to using SSAS MD :
* Dimension attribute types
* Dimension calculated members , which :
* must be a single real member when the dimension has more than one attribute ;
* can &apos;t be the key attribute of the dimension unless it &apos;s the only attribute ; and
* can &apos;t be a parent-child attribute .
* Measures ( with or without measure groups )
* Measures as variant

This sample relies on two measures of revenue :
* Revenue : A salesperson &apos;s estimate of what the revenue will be .
# # What is our dashboard telling us ?
Our sales manager has created a dashboard to track those metrics most important to them . When they see something interesting , they can select a tile to look into the data :
- Company revenue is $ 2 billion and factored revenue is $ 461 million .
- Opportunity count and revenue follow a familiar funnel pattern , with totals decreasing with each subsequent stage .
- Most of our opportunities are in the East region .
- Large opportunities generate more revenue than medium or small opportunities .
Because the effort to land a deal is the same whether the deal is classified as large , medium , or small , our company should analyze the data to learn more about large opportunities .
# # Explore the pages in the report
View each page in the report by selecting the page tabs at the bottom .
# # # Opportunity Count Overview page
Note the following details :
* East is our biggest region in terms of opportunity counts .
# # # Revenue Analysis page
This page takes a similar look at the data , but uses a revenue perspective instead of count .
* East is our biggest region , not only in opportunity count but also in revenue .
* Average revenue for small and medium businesses is comparable for both partner driven and non-partner driven business .
Clearly our partners are doing a better job than non-partners selling to customers . It might make sense to funnel more deals through our partners .
# # # Opportunity Count by Region and Stage
This page of the report looks at data similar to the data on the previous page but breaks it down by region and stage .
* Large opportunities are most common in the Central region , small opportunities are most common in the East region , and medium opportunities are most common in the West region .
# # # Upcoming Opportunities by Month page
For this page we &apos;re looking at similar factors , but from a date and time perspective .
Our CFO uses this page to manage workload . By looking at the revenue opportunities by sales stage and month , they can plan accordingly .
* Average revenue for the Finalize sales stage is the highest . Closing these deals is a top priority .

# Create the new workspaces in Power BI
Here &apos;s how the new workspaces differ from the old . In the new workspaces , you can :
- Assign workspace roles to user groups and individuals .
- Use more granular workspace roles for more flexible permissions management .
# # Create one of the new workspaces
2 . Give the workspace a unique name . If the name isn &apos;t available , edit it to come up with a unique name .
The app you create from the workspace will have the same name and icon as the workspace .
1 . Here are some optional items you can set for your workspace :
Power BI creates the workspace and opens it . You see it in the list of workspaces you ’ re a member of .
# # Create a contact list
In the * * Create a workspace * * pane when you first create it .
# # # Access the workspace OneDrive location
After you &apos;ve configured the OneDrive location , you get to it in the same way you get to other data sources in the Power BI service .
# # # Connect to apps in new workspaces
In the new workspace experience , you can &apos;t create or consume organizational content packs . Ask your internal teams to provide apps for any content packs you ’ re currently using .
# # Give access to your workspace
Anyone who has an admin role in a workspace can give others access to the workspace .
When enabled , Contributors can :
* Update app metadata like name , icon , description , support site , and color
* Add or remove items included in the app , like adding reports or datasets
* Change the app navigation or default item the app opens on
However , Contributors are not able to :
* Change who has permission to the app
title : Share Power BI dashboards and reports with coworkers and others
# Share Power BI dashboards and reports with coworkers and others
* Sharing * is the easiest way to give people access to your dashboards and reports in the Power BI service . You can share with people inside or outside your organization .
# # Share a dashboard or report
3 . Add a message if you want . It &apos;s optional .
# # See who has access to a dashboard or report
Sometimes you need to see the people you &apos;ve shared with , and see who they &apos;ve shared it with .
People outside your organization are listed as * * Guest * * .
# # Share a dashboard or report outside your organization
They can &apos;t edit any content in this dashboard or report . They can interact with the charts and change filters or slicers , but can &apos;t save their changes .
People outside your organization don &apos;t see any data at all if role- or row-level security is implemented on on-premises Analysis Services tabular models .
If you send a link from a Power BI mobile app to people outside your organization , clicking the link opens the dashboard in a browser , not in the Power BI mobile app .
# # # Allow external users to edit content
# # Share with more than 100 separate users
At most , you can share with 100 users or groups in a single share action . However , you can give more than 500 users access to an item . Here are some suggestions :
- Share multiple times by specifying the users individually .
- Share with a user group that contains all the users .
# # Stop or change sharing
# # # If you haven &apos;t sent the sharing invitation yet
# # # If you &apos;ve already shared the dashboard or report
Things to keep in mind about sharing dashboards and reports :

# # # From the dashboard tile
1 . To modify an alert , select the arrow to the left of the alert name .
1 . To delete an alert , select the trashcan to the right of the alert name .
# # # From the Power BI settings menu
* Alerts aren &apos;t supported for card tiles with date / time measures .
* Alerts only work with numeric data types .
* Alerts only work on refreshed data . They don &apos;t work on static data .
* Alerts only work on streaming datasets if you build a KPI , card , or gauge report visual and then pin that visual to the dashboard .

The following section describes troubleshooting steps you can take to help address trouble you might run into .
# # # Missing or outdated R packages
When attempting to install an R-powered custom visual , you can run into errors when there are missing or outdated R packages ; this is due to one of the following reasons :
* The R installation is incompatible with the R package
* The firewall , anti-virus software , or proxy settings are preventing R from connecting to the Internet
* The Internet connection is slow or there &apos;s an Internet connection problem
1 . Remove the custom visual , then install it again . This initiates a reinstallation of the R packages .
Supported R versions are listed in the description of each R-powered custom visual , as shown in the following image .
a . Download the R-powered visual installation script and save that file to a local drive .
b . From the R console , run the following :

title : &quot; DAX : Avoid using FILTER as a filter argument &quot;
&gt; This article is especially relevant for model calculations that apply filters to Import tables .
We recommend you pass filter arguments as Boolean expressions , whenever possible . It &apos;s because Import model tables are in-memory column stores . They are explicitly optimized to efficiently filter columns in this way .
There are , however , restrictions that apply to Boolean expressions when they &apos;re used as filter arguments . They :
- Cannot compare columns to other columns
- Cannot reference a measure
- Cannot use nested CALCULATE functions
It means that you &apos;ll need to use table expressions for more complex filter requirements .
Consider now a different measure definition .
Here &apos;s one more example . The requirement this time is to calculate sales , but only for months that have achieved a profit .
For best performance , we recommend you use Boolean expressions as filter arguments , whenever possible .
Therefore , the FILTER function should only be used when necessary . You can use it to perform filter complex column comparisons . These column comparisons can involve :
- Other columns

# Use the Analytics pane in Power BI Desktop
# # Use the Analytics pane
With the * * Analytics * * pane , you can create the following types of dynamic reference lines :
* X-Axis constant line
* Y-Axis constant line
&gt; Not all lines are available for all visual types .
To view the available dynamic reference lines for a visual , follow these steps :
You can highlight many interesting insights by creating dynamic reference lines with the * * Analytics * * pane .
We &apos;re planning more features and capabilities , including expanding which visuals can have dynamic reference lines applied to them . Check back often to see what &apos;s new .
&gt; The forecasting feature is only available for line chart visuals .
The ability to use dynamic reference lines is based on the type of visual being used . The following lists describe these limitations more specifically .
* Clustered bar chart
* Clustered column chart
* Stacked area chart
* Stacked bar chart
* Stacked column chart
* 100 % Stacked bar chart
* 100 % Stacked column chart
The following visuals can use a * trend line * if there &apos;s time data :
* Line and clustered column chart
* Line and stacked column chart

# # Select Focus mode to see more detail .
* Hover over the visualization and select the Focus mode icon .
# # # Ad hoc per item sharing
The process is considered ad-hoc since business users in Contoso perform the invite action as needed for their business purposes . Each item shared is a single link the external user can access to view the content .
# # # Planned per item sharing
1 . The process starts with an IT administrator inviting the guest user either manually or through the API provided by Azure Active Directory
2 . The user accepts the invite to the organization .
# # # Ad hoc or planned sharing of Power BI Apps
1 . The process starts by the user being invited to Contoso &apos;s Azure AD organization through the Azure portal or PowerShell
# # # Commenting and subscribing to content across organizations
# # # Access content in the Power BI mobile apps
# # # Cross-organization editing and management of Power BI content
This scenario is described in detail in the section Enabling external users to edit and manage content within Power BI later in this document .
# # # Case 1 : Direct collaboration between organizations
This follows the following process :
1 . Users from each Subsidiary are invited to Contoso &apos;s Azure AD
2 . Then the Power BI app is published to give these users access to the required data
3 . Finally , the users open the app through a link they &apos;ve been given to see the reports
Several important challenges are faced by organizations in this structure :
- How to distribute links to content in the Parent organization &apos;s Power BI
- How to allow subsidiary users to access data source hosted by the parent organization
# # # # Allowing subsidiary users to access data sources hosted by the parent organization
Often analysts at a subsidiary need to create their own analytics using data supplied by the parent organization . In this case , commonly cloud data sources are used to address the challenge .
More sophisticated approaches are also possible , however the above are by far the most common .
# # # Case 3 : Shared environment across partners
The process is as follows :
# # # Case 4 : Distribution to hundreds or thousands of external partners
- Contoso &apos;s BI team creates a workspace in Power BI
- Other authors are added to the workspace
- Content is created inside the workspace
Now that the content is created in a workspace , Contoso is ready to invite guest users in partner organizations to consume this content .
2 . Invite Guest Users
* Planned Invites
After the invitation , guest users receive an email with the invitation link .
Once the guest users click the link , they can access content in the Contoso Azure AD tenant .
&gt; Invites are needed only the first time an external user is invited to your organization .
3 . Distribute Content
Guest users get an email with a link to the app .
On clicking this link , guest users are asked to authenticate with their own organization &apos;s identity .
Once they are successfully authenticated , they are redirected to Contoso &apos;s BI app .
4 . Next steps
Often individual reports and dashboards need to be embedded into an existing portal . This can also be accomplished reusing many of the techniques shown in the example . However , in those situations it may be easier to embed reports or dashboards directly from a workspace . The process for inviting and assigning security permission to the require users remain the same .
Now that we have seen how Contoso is able to seamlessly distribute Power BI content to guest users in partner organizations , let &apos;s look at how this works under the hood .
Contoso can choose one of three approaches to license guest users from its suppliers and partner organizations to have access to Power BI content .
# # Data security for external partners
Let &apos;s walk through this with an example .
This opens a page where Contoso &apos;s BI team can see the two roles they created . Now Contoso &apos;s BI team can assign users to the roles .
Now when this user opens the app that was shared with them , they only see a report with data from Europe :
# # # Dynamic row level security
Let &apos;s look at a small example - Contoso has a simple report on sales by groups :
Then , Contoso creates the right data model that filters the data appropriately with the right relationships :
Contoso also creates another &quot; AllRole &quot; for its internal users who can see everything – this role does not have any security predicate .
Now the internal user gets to see all the data :
As you can see , Dynamic RLS works with both internal or guest users .
# # Connecting to on premises data sources
# # Enabling external users to edit and manage content within Power BI
Contoso can allow external users to contribute content within the organization as described earlier in the cross-organization editing and management of Power BI content section .
In the Power BI Admin portal , the setting is shown in the following image .
To help these users to log in to Power BI , provide them with the Tenant URL . To find the tenant URL , follow these steps .
- Direct publishing from Power BI desktop to the Power BI service
- Guest users cannot use Power BI desktop to connect to service datasets in the Power BI service
- Sending ad-hoc invites is not supported for workspace access lists
- Guest users cannot install a Power BI Gateway and connect it to your organization
- Guest users cannot install apps publish to the entire organization
- Guest users cannot use , create , update , or install organizational content packs
- Guest users cannot use Analyze in Excel
- Guest users cannot be @ mentioned in commenting ( this functionality will be added in an upcoming release )
- Guest users cannot use subscriptions ( this functionality will be added in an upcoming release )
- Guest users who use this capability should have a work or school account . Guest users using Personal accounts experience more limitations due to sign-in restrictions .
Details on the settings are available here :
# # # Control guest invites
- Only admins and users in the Guest Inviter role can invite
- Admins , the Guest Inviter role , and members can invite
- All users , including guests , can invite
# # # Conditional Access policies for guest users
Reasons to choose this alternative :
- Users who use personal accounts for their business often are restricted from accessing certain services so may need an organizational account .
Reasons not to choose this alternative :
- When the user leaves their organization , they continue to have access to Contoso &apos;s resources until the Contoso admin manually deletes their account
- Contoso admins have to manage the identity for the guest , including creation , password resets , etc .
- Typical Partner Portals are highly branded experiences with consistent experiences across partners and streamlined to meet the needs of typical partners . Contoso can therefore offer a better overall experience to partners by integrating all required services into a single portal .
- Provides better isolation across partners if architected as a multi-tenant solution .
- Significant effort is required to build , operate , and maintain such a portal making it a significant investment in resources and time .
- Time to solution is much longer than using B2B sharing since careful planning and execution across multiple workstreams is required .
- Where there are a smaller number of partners the effort required for this alternative is likely too high to justify .
- Collaboration with ad-hoc sharing is the primary scenario faced by your organization .
- The reports and dashboards are different for each partner . This alternative introduces management overhead beyond just sharing directly with Partners .
The end user must always click through the consent experience before they can access content .
* * How does B2B collaboration work when the invited partner is using federation to add their own on-premises authentication ? * *
* * Can I invite guest users with consumer email accounts ? * *
# Use the Analyze feature to explain fluctuations in report visuals
The Analyze feature is contextual , and is based on the immediately previous data point - such as the previous bar , or column .
&gt; This feature is in preview , and is subject to change . The insight feature is enabled and on by default ( you don &apos;t need to check a Preview box to enable it ) .
# # # Which factors and categories are chosen
To see all of the insights generated by Power BI , use the scrollbar . The order is ranked with the most significant contributor displayed first .
Use the * thumbs up * and * thumbs down * icons at the top of the page to provide feedback about the visual and the feature .
The dotted line shows the best fit , and data points above this line increased by more than the overall trend , and those below it by less .
Data items whose value was blank in either period will not appear on the scatter plot .
In this scenario , an investigation was triggered when users complained that report data sometimes appeared to be old or &quot; stale &quot; .
There are several possible explanations for these results :
- Frequently queried datasets that need to stay in memory may affect the ability of other datasets to refresh because of limited available memory .
To help investigate , the Power BI administrator can look for :
- Low available memory at the time of data refreshes when available memory is less than 2x the size of the dataset to be refreshed .
The Power BI administrator can attempt to resolve the issue by taking steps to ensure that sufficient memory is available for data refreshes to start by :
- Contacting dataset owners and asking them to stagger and space out data refresh schedules .
- Reducing dataset query load by removing unnecessary dashboards or dashboard tiles , especially those that enforce row-level security .
- Speeding up data refreshes by optimizing Power Query logic . Improve modeling calculated columns or tables . Reduce dataset sizes or configure larger datasets to perform incremental data refresh .
In this scenario , an investigation began when users complained that certain reports took too long to open , and at times would stop responding .
There are several possible reasons for query wait time buildup in datasets :
In this scenario , an investigation began when users described that report visuals sometimes were slow to respond or could become unresponsive , but at other times they were acceptably responsive .
Within the app , the * * Query Durations * * section was used to find the culprit dataset in the following way :
- The one-hour bars showing an irregular portion of poor performing queries , indicated a timespan where that dataset was impacted by a noisy neighbor effect , caused by other datasets &apos; activities .
A solution to this problem could be to distribute the culprit datasets over different workspaces on different Premium capacities , or on shared capacity if the dataset size , consumption requirements , and data refresh patterns are supported .
The reverse could be true as well . The Power BI administrator could identify times when a dataset query performance drastically improves and then look for what disappeared . If certain information is missing at that point , then that may help to point to the causing problem .
# # Determining whether there is enough memory
In a healthy capacity the visual will look like this , showing a gap between All ( total ) and Active memory :
# # Determining whether there is enough CPU
In general , a capacity &apos;s average CPU utilization should remain below 80 % . Exceeding this value means the capacity is approaching CPU saturation .
title : Complete code listing
# Push data to a dataset complete code listing
# # Push data to dataset code
title : Dataset modes in the Power BI service
# Dataset modes in the Power BI service
The three dataset modes are :
Design flexibility can be achieved in three ways . Data modelers can :
As shown in the following image , an Import model can integrate data from any number of supported data source types .
However , while there are compelling advantages associated with Import models , there are disadvantages , too :
- The entire model must be loaded to memory before Power BI can query the model , which can place pressure on available capacity resources , especially as the number and size of Import models grow
From a Power BI service resource perspective , Import models require :
- Sufficient memory to load the model when it &apos;s queried or refreshed
- Processing resources and additional memory resources to refresh data
There are two main reasons to consider developing a DirectQuery model :
There are several advantages associated with DirectQuery models :
- Import model size limits don &apos;t apply
- Models don &apos;t require refresh
- Report users will see the latest data when interacting with report filters and slicers . Also , report users can refresh the entire report to retrieve current data .
- Dashboard tiles , when based on DirectQuery models , can update automatically as frequently as every 15 minutes
However , there are some limitations associated with DirectQuery models :
- DAX formulas are limited to use only functions that can be transposed to native queries understood by the data source . Calculated tables are not supported .
- Q &amp; A and Quick Insights features aren &apos;t supported
From a Power BI service resource perspective , DirectQuery models require :
- Minimal memory to load the model ( metadata only ) when it &apos;s queried
Composite models strive to deliver the best of Import and DirectQuery modes . When configured appropriately they can combine the high query performance of in-memory models with the ability to retrieve near real-time data from data sources .
In general , for Composite models , the advantages and disadvantages associated with Import and DirectQuery , depending on how each table is configured .
title : Create a drill-through button in Power BI
# Create a drill-through button in Power BI
# # Set up a drill-through button
If you leave the tooltips boxes blank , Power BI automatically generates tooltips . Those tooltips are based on the destination and drill-through field ( s ) .
Here &apos;s an example of the autogenerated tooltip when the button is disabled :
And here &apos;s an example of the autogenerated tooltip when the button is enabled :
After you select the drill-through button , you see filters on both Store and Product being passed through to the destination page :
# # # Ambiguous filter context
Since the drill-through button isn &apos;t tied to a single visual , if your selection is ambiguous , then the button is disabled .
In this example , the button is disabled because two visuals both contain a single selection on Product . There &apos;s ambiguity about which data point from which visual to tie the drill-through action to :
# # Customize formatting for disabled buttons
You can customize the formatting options for the disabled state of drill-through buttons .
These formatting options include :
# # Set formatting for button text conditionally
You can use conditional formatting to change the button text based on the selected value of a field . To do this , you need to create a measure that outputs the desired string based on the DAX function SELECTEDVALUE .
Here &apos;s an example measure that outputs &quot; See product details &quot; if a single Product value is NOT selected ; otherwise , it outputs &quot; See details for &#91; the selected Product &#93; &quot; :
Then , you select the measure you created for the button text :
When a single product is selected , the button text reads :
&quot; See details for Word &quot;
When either no products are selected , or more than one product is selected , the button is disabled . The button text reads :
&quot; See product details &quot;
# # Set formatting for tooltips conditionally
If the user has selected a single product , but not a single store , the measure returns : “ Ctrl + click to also select a single store . ”
- Similarly , you can set the enabled-state tooltip to be specific the user ’ s selection . For example , if you want the user to know which product and store the drill-through page will be filtered to , you can create a measure that returns :
# # Set the drill-through destination conditionally
You can use conditional formatting to set the drill-through destination based on the output of a measure .
Here are some scenarios where you might want the button drill-through destination to be conditional :
For example , you want users to select a single product * and * a single store before they can drill through to the Market details page . Otherwise the button is disabled .
# # # Disable the button until multiple conditions are met
Here ’ s an example DAX measure that requires a Store to be selected before the user can drill through on a Product to Store details page :
For the last step , you select the DAX measure you created as the field value for the destination :
Now you see the button is disabled even when a single product is selected , because the measure also requires you to select a single store :
# # # Support multiple destinations
For the other common case where you want to support multiple destinations , you start by creating a single-column table with the names of the drill-through destinations :
Power BI uses exact string match to set the drill-through destination , so double-check that the entered values exactly align with your drill-through page names .
After you &apos;ve created the table , add it to the page as a single-select slicer :
If you need more vertical space , convert the slicer to a dropdown . Remove the slicer header and add a text box with the title next to it :
Alternatively , change the list slicer from vertical to horizontal orientation :
Now you see that the drill-through button is only enabled when you &apos;ve selected a product * and * a destination :
# # # Hybrid of the two scenarios
Here ’ s an example DAX measure that requires the user to select a Store before they can drill through on a Product to any of drill-through pages :
In this example , the user would need to select a Product , a Store , * and * a destination page before the drill-through button is enabled :
- This button doesn &apos;t allow for multiple destinations using a single button .
- This button only supports drill throughs within the same report ; in other words , it doesn &apos;t support cross-report drill through .

title : Referencing Power Query queries
Generally , we recommend you reference queries to avoid the duplication of logic across your queries . However , as described in this article , this design approach can contribute to slow data refreshes , and overburden data sources .
We suggest you use the Implementation 2.0 SAP Connector whenever possible .
When you select one or more items from the server , the Navigator dialog creates a preview of the output table .
The * * Navigator * * dialog also provides display options :
After selecting all necessary objects , you can decide what to do next by selecting one of the following options :
Implementation 2.0 supports the following options :
The default value is `SapBusinessWarehouseExecutionMode.BasXmlGzip` .
Using `SapBusinessWarehouseExecutionMode.BasXmlGzip` may improve performance when experiencing high latency for large datasets .
# # # Additional improvements for Implementation 2.0
The following list describes some of the additional improvements that come with the new implementation :
* Improved performance .
* Ability to retrieve several million rows of data , and fine-tuning through the batch size parameter .
* Ability to switch execution modes .
* Support for compressed mode . Especially beneficial for high latency connections or large datasets .
* Improved detection of `Date` variables .
* Better exception handling . Errors that occur in BAPI calls are now surfaced .
# # # Changing existing reports to use Implementation 2.0
Determine whether the query already contains an option record , such as the following example :
If the query doesn &apos;t already include an options record , just add it . For the following option :
Just change it to :
You can perform BEx queries in Power BI Desktop by enabling a specific property , as shown in the following image :

title : Understand data view mapping in Power BI visuals
# Understand data view mapping in Power BI visuals
This article discusses data view mapping and describes how data roles relate to each other and allow you to specify conditional requirements for them . The article also describes each `dataMappings` type .
Power BI creates a mapping to a data view if and only if the valid mapping is filled in `dataViewMappings` .
Power BI produces a data view with a single `categorical` mapping , and `table` and other mappings are undefined :
This section describes conditions for a particular data mapping . You can provide multiple sets of conditions and , if the data matches one of the described sets of conditions , the visual accepts the data as valid .
Currently , for each field , you can specify a minimum and maximum value . The value represents the number of fields that can be bound to that data role .
&gt; If a data role is omitted in the condition , it can have any number of fields .
You can drag multiple fields into each data role . In this example , you limit the category to one data field and the measure to two data fields .
In this example , either of two conditions is required :
* Exactly one category data field and exactly two measures
* Exactly two categories and exactly one measure .
Code sample to process simple data view mapping
As a result the visual displays a single value from Power BI :
Categorical data mapping is used to get one or two independent groupings of data .
Here is the definition from the previous example for data roles :
Here is the mapping :
This example uses the first two data roles from the previous example and additionally defines `grouping` and `measure2` .
Here the difference is in how we are mapping categorical.values. We are saying that &quot; Map my `measure` and `measure2` data roles to be grouped by the data role `grouping` . &quot;
Here are the data roles :
Here is the data view mapping :
The categorical data view could be visualized like this :
Power BI produces it as the categorical data view . It &apos;s the set of categories .
Each category maps to a set of values as well . Each of these values is grouped by series , which is expressed as years .
For example , each `values` array represents data for each year .
The result of the visual :
The table data view is a simple data mapping . Essentially , it &apos;s a list of data points , where numeric data points could be aggregated .
With the given capabilities :
You can visualize the table data view as the following :
Power BI displays your data as the table data view . You shouldn &apos;t assume that the data is ordered .
You can aggregate the data by selecting the desired field and then selecting sum .
Matrix data mapping is similar to table data mapping , but the rows are presented hierarchically . Any of the data role values can be used as a column header value .
The core matrix visual of Power BI renders the data as a table .
The visual gets its data structure as described in the following code ( only the first two table rows are shown here ) :
To control the amount of data to receive in the data view , you can apply a data reduction algorithm .
# # Data reduction algorithm types
There are four types of data reduction algorithm settings :
* `bottom` : If you want to limit the data to values taken from the bottom of the dataset . The last &quot; count &quot; values will be taken from the dataset .
The data reduction algorithm can be used in categorical , table , or matrix data view mapping .
You can set the algorithm into `categories` and / or group section of `values` for categorical data mapping .
You can apply the data reduction algorithm to the `rows` section of the Data View mapping table .
You can apply the data reduction algorithm to the `rows` and `columns` sections of the Data View mapping matrix .
title : Create Power BI visuals using R
# Create Power BI visuals using R
# # Enable R visuals in Power BI Desktop
After you &apos;ve verified your R installation , you ’ re ready to begin creating R visuals .
# # Create R visuals in Power BI Desktop
When you add an R visual to a report , Power BI Desktop makes the following changes :
- A placeholder R visual image appears on the report canvas .
&gt; The default aggregation type for R visuals is * do not summarize * .
* The default aggregation is : * do not summarize * .
* Similar to table visuals , fields are grouped and duplicate rows appear only once .
Power BI Desktop replots the visual when any of the following events occur :
* A data change occurs because of data refreshing , filtering , or highlighting .
The following image shows an example of the correlation plot code , which plots the correlations between attributes of different types of cars .
7 . Modify the R script to customize the visual , and take advantage of the power of R by adding parameters to the plotting command .
The original plotting command is :
Change the R script so that the plotting command is as follows :
As a result , the R visual now plots circles , only considers the upper half , and reorders the matrix to cluster correlated attributes .
R visuals in Power BI Desktop have the following limitations :
* Resolution : All R visuals are displayed at 72 DPI .
* Plotting device : Only plotting to the default device is supported .
* Calculation times : If an R visual calculation exceeds five minutes , it causes a time-out error .
* Highlights : R visuals respond if you highlight other visuals , but you can &apos;t select elements in the R visual to cross filter other elements .
* Display devices : Only plots that are plotted to the R default display device are displayed correctly on the canvas . Avoid explicitly using a different R display device .
* Column renaming : R visuals do not support renaming input columns . Columns will be referred to by their original name during script execution .

# Create and use combo charts in Power BI
In Power BI , a combo chart is a single visualization that combines a line chart and a column chart . Combining the 2 charts into one lets you make a quicker comparison of the data .
Combo charts can have one or two Y axes .
# # When to use a Combo chart
Combo charts are a great choice :
* when you have a line chart and a column chart with the same X axis .
* to illustrate the correlation between two measures in one visualization .
* to check whether one measure meet the target which is defined by another measure
* to conserve canvas space .
# # Create a basic , single-axis , Combo Chart
Watch Will create a combo chart using the Sales and Marketing sample .
1 . Start on a blank report page and create a column chart that displays this year &apos;s sales and gross margin by month .
Your combo chart should look something like this :
# # Create a combo chart with two axes
In this task , we &apos;ll compare gross margin and sales .
3 . To make the visual easier to read and interpret , convert the line chart to a Line and Stacked Column chart .
# # Add titles to the axes
Your combo chart now displays dual axes , both with titles .

&gt; As an alternative to right-clicking on a bar , you can select the * Expand * button on the top left of the visualization .
# # # Using inline hierarchy labels
&gt; The inline hierarchy label feature doesn &apos;t yet allow for the built-in time hierarchy to be sorted by value ; it &apos;s only sorted by hierarchy order .
Steps that might get your visuals stuck in an expanded state :
1 . You enable the * * inline hierarchy label * * feature
2 . You create some visuals with hierarchies
3 . Then you * * Expand All * * and save your file
5 . Then you re-open your file
If you happen to take those steps , and your visuals are stuck in expanded mode , you can do the following to troubleshoot them :
2 . Re-open your file , and drill back up to top of your affected visual ( s )
3 . Save your file
5 . Re-open your file
Alternatively , you can just delete your visual and recreate it .

title : Power BI report scheduled refresh in Power BI Report Server
# Power BI report scheduled refresh in Power BI Report Server
Scheduled refresh for Power BI reports allows the data for a report to stay up to date .
Several components are involved when using scheduled refresh for your Power BI reports .
* SQL Server Agent as a timer to generate scheduled events .
* Scheduled jobs are added to a queue of events and notifications in the report server database . In a scale-out deployment , the queue is shared across all of the report servers in the deployment .
* The data model is loaded within an Analysis Services instance .
* In a scale-out configuration , the data model can be replicated across nodes .
* Analysis Services processes the data and executes any needed calculations .
# # # When scheduled refresh can &apos;t be used
Not all Power BI Reports can have a scheduled refresh plan created on them . The following is a list of Power BI Reports that you Can &apos;t create a scheduled refresh plan .
* Your report contains one or more Analysis Services data sources , which use a live connection .
* Your report contains one or more data sources , which use DirectQuery .
# # # Data model size limit

# # Q &amp; A helps you phrase the question
* corrects spelling .
* suggests replacement terms from the underlying dataset ( s ) when you move the cursor back in the question box .
* restates the question based on the data in the underlying dataset ( s ) . Q &amp; A replaces the words you used with synonyms from the underlying dataset ( s ) . By reading the restatement , you know whether Q &amp; A understood your question or not .
* adds a double underline to words it doesn &apos;t understand .
* adds a single underline to words it does understand .
* allows you to contact the report or dashboard owner when your term isn &apos;t found or your question doesn &apos;t get results .

1 . Open a paginated or Power BI report on a report server .
In the Comments pane , you can see any existing comments .
Your comment shows in the pane on the web portal , along with any previous comments . They don &apos;t appear with the report on in the Power BI mobile apps .
Depending on your permissions , you can :
* Not see comments .
* See all comments , and post , edit , and delete your own .
* See all comments ; post , edit , and delete your own ; and delete other people ’ s .
If you want to compare two different measures , such as unit sales verses revenue , a common visualization to use is a scatter chart .

# Filters and highlighting in Power BI reports
* Introduction to filters and highlighting , the article you &apos;re reading now .
# # Intro to the Filters pane
There are four types of filters .
- * * page filter * * applies to all the visuals on the report page
- * * report filter * * applies to all pages in the report
- * * drillthrough filter * * applies to a single entity in a report
You can search in page , visual , and report filters , in Reading or Editing view , to find and select the value you want .
# # Filters in Reading or Editing view
* In Reading view , you can interact with any filters that already exist in the report , and save the selections you make . You can &apos;t add new filters .
# # # Filters in Reading view
If you only have access to a report in Reading view , the Filters pane looks similar to this :
So this page of the report has six page-level filters and one report-level filter .
Each visual can have filters for all the fields in the visual , and a report author may add more . In the image below , the bubble chart has six filters .
# # # Filters in Editing view
title : Use visual elements to enhance Power BI reports
# Use visual elements to enhance Power BI reports
* Apply * * wallpaper * * to your reports so your background can enhance or highlight elements of the story you want to tell with your data
The following sections describe how to use these enhancements , and how to apply them to your reports .
It &apos;s useful to keep in mind the following definitions that pertain to * * wallpaper * * :
* The gray area outside of your report area is the * * wallpaper * * area
For all new reports , the default settings are the following :
When you set your page background to greater than 50 % transparency , a dotted border appears while you are creating or editing your report , to show you the boundary of the report canvas border .
# # Using improved visual headers in Power BI reports
If your visual doesn &apos;t have a title , the header floats above the top of the visual aligned to the right , as shown in the following image .
If your visual is positioned all the way to the top of your report , the visual header instead snaps to the bottom of the visual .
&gt; The visibility of toggles do not affect your report when you are authoring or editing the report . You must publish the report and view it in reading mode to see the effect . This behavior ensures that the many options provided in visual headers are important during editing , especially warning icons that alert you to issues while editing .
# # # Enabling improved visual headers for existing reports
title : Use cross-report drill through in Power BI Desktop
# Use cross-report drill through in Power BI
The drill-through action opens the * target page * in the * target report * .
This article shows you how to set up and use cross-report drill through for Power BI reports .
After you validate your models , enable the source report to use cross-report drill through .
You can also enable cross-report drill through from the Power BI service .
1 . In Power BI service , select the workspace that contains your target and source reports .
# # Set up a cross-report drill-through target
That &apos;s it . Your reports are ready for cross-report drill through .
You see the results in the target cross-report drill-through page , just as you set them up when you created the target . The results are filtered according to the drill-through settings .
- Cross-filter and cross-highlighting that affect the source visual
- Slicers and sync-slicers on the page
- URL parameters
Cross-report drill through doesn &apos;t work in Power BI reports in Power BI Report Server .
title : &quot; Active vs inactive relationship guidance &quot;
Generally , we recommend defining active relationships whenever possible . They widen the scope and potential of how your model can be used by report authors , and users working with Q &amp; A .
Here &apos;s a partial model diagram of the two tables .
Here &apos;s the improved model design .
The improved model design supports producing the following report design .
The report page filters by Melbourne as the departure airport , and the table visual groups by arrival airports .
&gt; Further , it &apos;s common that dimension-type tables contain low row counts relative to fact-type table row counts . So , the increased model size and refresh times aren &apos;t likely to be excessively large .
Here &apos;s a methodology to refactor a model from a single role-playing dimension-type table , to a design with _ one table per role _ .
1 . Remove any inactive relationships .
In the example , the * * Departure Airport * * table was created by using the following calculated table definition .
4 . Create an active relationship to relate the new table .
In specific circumstances , inactive relationships can address special reporting needs .
Let &apos;s now consider different model and reporting requirements :
- Each row in the * * Sales * * table records a single order
- There &apos;s no requirement to simultaneously filter ( or group by ) order _ and _ ship date periods
In summary , we recommend defining active relationships whenever possible . They widen the scope and potential of how your model can be used by report authors , and users working with Q &amp; A. It means that role-playing dimension-type tables should be duplicated in your model .
In specific circumstances , however , you can define one or more inactive relationships for a role-playing dimension-type table . You can consider this design when :
- There &apos;s no requirement for report visuals to simultaneously filter by different roles
- You use the USERELATIONSHIP DAX function to activate a specific relationship for relevant model calculations

# Licenses and subscriptions for * consumers *
What you can do in the Power BI service depends on three things :
- the type of license and subscription you &apos;re using ,
- where content is stored , and
- the roles and permissions you &apos;re assigned .
It &apos;s possible to have more than one license at the same time . The service always delivers you the experience equal to the most-permissive license you currently have .
# # Power BI Premium capacity
# # Find out which licenses you have
This second user , Zalan , has a Power BI free license .
# # Find out if you have access to Premium capacity
We can determine whether Zalan &apos;s organization has Premium capacity by looking up the amount of storage available .
# # Identify content hosted in Premium capacity
Another way to find out if your organization has Premium capacity is to look for apps and app workspaces with a diamond icon . The diamond indicates that the content is stored in Premium capacity .
In the image below , three of the apps are stored in Premium capacity .

Using * * variables * * are an extremely powerful part of a DAX expression .
You can define a variable anywhere in a DAX expression , using the following syntax :
Variables can be any data type , including entire tables .
title : Show the data that was used to create the visual
# Show data with Power BI reports
# # Show the data being used to create a report visual
3 . By default , the data displays below the visual .
# DAX : Use COUNTROWS instead of COUNT
However , the following measure definition is a better solution .
There are three reasons why the second measure definition is better :
- It &apos;s more efficient , and so it will perform better .
- It doesn &apos;t consider BLANKs contained in any column of the table .
- The intention of formula is clearer , to the point of being self-describing .
When it &apos;s your intention to count table rows , we recommend that you always use the COUNTROWS function .
# Work with Modeling view in Power BI Desktop
The following articles describe more about data models , and also describe DirectQuery in detail .
# Expression examples in Power BI Report Builder
This topic provides examples of expressions that can be used for common tasks in a report .
For example , this expression will show the number of the week in the current year for today &apos;s date :
When used as a calculated field in a dataset , you can use this expression on a chart to aggregate values by week within each month .
- The following expression formats the SellStartDate value as MMM-YY . SellStartDate field is a datetime data type .
The following example displays the start date of the current year
- The following example displays the start date for the previous month based on the current month .
- The following expressions display various dates based on a date parameter value selected by the user .
- Combine more than one field by using concatenation operators and Visual Basic constants . The following expression returns two fields , each on a separate line in the same text box :
The following example does the same as the above example , as well as displays a text string prior to the list of selected values .
You can use Visual Basic functions to convert a field from the one data type to a different data type . Conversion functions can be used to convert the default data type for a field to the data type needed for calculations or to combine text .
In an expression , you can add a reference to additional report functions that manipulate data in a report . This section provides examples for two of these functions .
When designing a report , you may want to display the name of the report and page number in the report footer . To do this , you can use the following expressions :
- The following expression , placed in a text box in the footer of a report , provides page number and total pages in the report :
The following examples describe how to display the first and last values from a page in the page header , similar to what you might find in a directory listing . The example assumes a data region that contains a text box named `LastName` .
The following example describes how to display a page total . The example assumes a data region that contains a text box named `Cost` .
Expressions are not only used to display data in text boxes . They can also be used to change how properties are applied to report items . You can change style information for a report item , or change its visibility .
- The following expression , when used in the Color property of a text box , changes the color of the text depending on the value of the `Profit` field :
You can also use the Visual Basic object variable `Me` . This variable is another way of referring to the value of a text box .
- The following expression , when used in the BackgroundColor property of a report item in a data region , alternates the background color of each row between pale green and white :
If you are using an expression for a specified scope , you may have to indicate the dataset for the aggregate function :
&gt; Available colors come from the .NET Framework KnownColor enumeration .
To specify colors for a Shape chart , you can use custom code to control the order that colors are mapped to data point values . This helps you use consistent colors for multiple charts that have the same category groups .
You can show and hide items in a report using the visibility properties for the report item . In a data region such as a table , you can initially hide detail rows based on the value in an expression .
- The following expression , when set in the Hidden property of a table , shows the table only if it has more than 12 rows :
You can customize URLs by using report data and also conditionally control whether URLs are added as an action for a text box .
You can use custom code embedded in a report .
# # # Using group variables for custom aggregation
You can initialize the value for a group variable that is local to a particular group scope and then include a reference to that variable in expressions . One of the ways that you can use a group variable with custom code is to implement a custom aggregate .
# # Suppressing null or zero values at run time
# # Make sure your data is formatted as a table
You &apos;ll want to make sure each column has a good name . It will make it easier to find the data you want when creating your reports in Power BI .
# # Import from a local drive
Once imported into Power BI , you can begin creating reports .

# # Explore the View menu
The options in the * * View * * menu give you flexibility to display report pages at the size and width you choose :
# # Use your browser to change page display
The zoom controls in your browser increase and decrease the available canvas area . Decreasing the zoom causes the available canvas area to expand , and vice versa .
Resizing your entire browser is another way to change the display size of your report .

That ’ s it – you can now publish reports that use this new functionality to your report server .
title : Troubleshoot sharing dashboards and reports
Here are some common issues that may come up when you &apos;re sharing a dashboard or report , or when someone else is sharing with you .
# # Dashboard recipients see a lock icon in a tile
The people you share with may see a locked tile in a dashboard , or a &quot; Permission required &quot; message when they try to view a report .
If so , you need to grant them permission to the underlying dataset .
# # I can &apos;t share a dashboard or report
# # I don &apos;t have access to a dashboard or report
* If you &apos;re not a Microsoft 365 admin , engage with your IT department or your internal support teams to ask about any upcoming maintenance .
# # Actions to take when maintenance is complete
* Users should refresh any open browser windows .

title : Understand how visuals interact in a report
# How visuals cross-filter each other in a Power BI report
# # How visuals interact with each other
# # # Cross-filtering and cross-highlighting
Let &apos;s define these terms as we look at the report pages below . The &quot; Total category volume by segment &quot; doughnut chart has two values : &quot; Moderation &quot; and &quot; Convenience &quot; .
# Create Power BI visuals by using Python
# # Create Python visuals in Power BI Desktop
When you add a Python visual to a report , Power BI Desktop takes the following actions :
- A placeholder Python visual image appears on the report canvas .
&gt; The default aggregation type for Python visuals is * do not summarize * .
1 . Now you can use the data you selected to create a plot .
As you select or remove fields , supporting code in the Python script editor is automatically generated or removed .
Based on your selections , the Python script editor generates the following binding code .
- The editor created a * dataset * dataframe , with the fields you added .
- The default aggregation is : * do not summarize * .
- Similar to table visuals , fields are grouped and duplicate rows appear only once .
Power BI Desktop replots the visual if any of the following events occur :
- Whenever a data change occurs , due to data refresh , filtering , or highlighting
Ok , let &apos;s create some visuals .
# # Create a scatter plot
Let &apos;s create a scatter plot to see if there &apos;s a correlation between age and weight .
Your Python script editor pane should now look like this :
# # Create a line plot with multiple columns
# # Create a bar plot
Python visuals in Power BI Desktop have a few limitations :
- Resolution . All Python visuals are displayed at 72 DPI .
- Calculation time limitation . If a Python visual calculation exceeds five minutes the execution times out which results in an error .
- Python visuals are refreshed upon data updates , filtering , and highlighting . However , the image itself isn &apos;t interactive and can &apos;t be the source of cross-filtering .
- Python visuals respond to highlighting other visuals , but you can &apos;t click on elements in the Python visual to cross filter other elements .
- Only plots that are plotted to the Python default display device are displayed correctly on the canvas . Avoid explicitly using a different Python display device .
- Python visuals do not support renaming input columns . Columns will be referred to by their original name during script execution .
Take a look at the following additional information about Python in Power BI .
This article provides guidance and considerations for deploying a data gateway for Power BI in your network environment .
# # Installation considerations for the on-premises data gateway
Before you install the on-premises data gateway for your Power BI cloud service , there are some considerations to keep in mind . The following sections describe these considerations .
# # # Number of users
The number of users who consume a report that uses the gateway is an important metric in your decision about where to install the gateway . Here are some questions to consider :
* Do all users use the same report ?
Here &apos;s what to consider for each option :
title : Add Drill-Down support
Power BI visuals can use Power BI &apos;s drill-down .
# # Enable drill-down support in the visual
To support drill down in your visual , add a new field to `capabilities.json` named &quot; drill-down &quot; , which has one property :
&gt; The drill-down dataRole must be of `Grouping` type .
&gt; `max` property in the dataRole conditions must be set to 1 .
Once you add the role to drill-down , users can drag multiple fields into the data role .
# # Create the visual with drill-down support
to create a default sample visual . And apply the above sample of `capabilities.json` to the newly created visual .
Create the property for `div` container to hold HTML elements of the visual :
Update the constructor of the visual :
Update the `update` method of the visual to create `button`s :
Prepare sample data to test the visual :
And create Hierarchy in Power BI Desktop :
After those steps you should get following visual :
# # Add context menu to visual elements
In this step you &apos;ll add context menu to the button &apos;s on the visual :
Change the body of `forEach` function callback to :
Apply data to the visual :
In the final step you should get visual with selections and context menu :
# # Add drill-down support for matrix data view mapping
Prepare sample data to test the visual with matrix data view mappings :
Apply following dataview mapping for the visual :
Import required interfaces to process matrix data view mappings :
Create two properties for two `div`s of rows and columns elements :
Check the data before rendering elements and display the current level of hierarchy :
Create function `treeWalker` for traverse the hierarchy :
Generate the selections for datapoints .
Create `div` for each level of hierarchy :
Create `buttons` to interact with visual and display context menu for matrix datapoints :
Clear `div` elements before render elements again :
At the final step you should get visual with context menu :
title : Card visualizations ( big number tiles )
The first method to create a card is to use the report editor in Power BI Desktop .
Power BI creates a column chart with the one number .
2 . In the Visualizations pane , select the card icon .
The Q &amp; A question box is another option for you to use when creating a card . The Q &amp; A question box is available in Power BI Desktop report view .
1 . Start on a blank report page
Power BI will create a card and a box for your question .
The question box helps you with suggestions and restatements , and finally displays the total number .
You have now successfully created a card with the Q &amp; A question box . Below are steps for formatting your card to your specific needs .
The Formatting pane is available when interacting with the card in a report .
1 . Start by selecting the paint roller icon to open the Formatting pane .
5 . Continue to explore the formatting options until your card is exactly how you &apos;d like it .
If you do not see a question box at all , contact your system or tenant administrator .
When the import is complete , the new app will appear on the Apps page .
2 . You can ask a question by typing in the Q &amp; A box , or click a tile to open the underlying report .

You should see a confirmation that Power BI closed your account . You can reopen your account from here if necessary .
title : Configure workspace dataflow settings
# Configure workspace dataflow settings ( Preview )
There are two ways to configure the workspace dataflow storage settings :
* During creation of the workspace
* By editing an existing workspace
We &apos;ll take a look at each in the following sections .
# # Create a new workspace , configure its dataflow storage
# # Update dataflow storage for an existing workspace
# # Get the URI of stored dataflow files
* The * * linked entities * * feature is only supported among workspaces in the same storage account
* Otherwise , all data prep features are the same as for dataflows stored in Power BI storage
There are some additional considerations as well , described in the following list :
* Once a dataflow storage location is configured , it cannot be changed .
1 . Anna creates a new workspace and configures it to store dataflows in the organization ’ s data lake .
This article provided guidance on how to configure workspace storage for dataflows . For additional information , take a look at the following articles :

title : Add a CDM folder to Power BI as a dataflow
There are a few requirements for creating dataflows from CDM folders , as the following list describes :
* You must be granted read and execute permissions on all files and folders in the CDM folder to add them to Power BI .
The following sections describe how to create a dataflow from a CDM folder .
# # Authorizing users for CDM folders to create a dataflow
In order to create a dataflow from a CDM folder the following permissions must be added :
# # Create a dataflow from a CDM folder
In the screen that appears , select to * * Create and attach * * as shown in the following image .
The following lists help clarify how dataflows from CDM folders operate with Power BI .
* Dataflows from CDM folders can &apos;t be edited
* Permissions to read a dataflow created from a CDM folder is managed by the owner of the CDM folder , and not by Power BI
* Only users who are authorized to both the workspace in which the dataflow was created and the CDM folder can access its data from the Power BI Dataflows connector
* Linked entities is not available for dataflows created from CDM folders
1 . Anna creates a new workspace and configures it to store dataflows from a CDM folder .
title : Default member in multidimensional models in Power BI
# Work with multidimensional models in Power BI
When creating a filter card on a field with a default member , the default member field value is selected automatically in the filter card . The result is that all visuals that are affected by the filter card retain their default models in the database . The values in such filter cards reflect that default member .
# # Attribute relationship paths ( ARPs )
Let &apos;s look at an example to clarify the behavior . Consider the following configuration of ARPs :
Now let &apos;s imagine the following * default members * are set for these columns :
* Population &gt; Large
Now let &apos;s examine what happens when each of the columns is used in Power BI . When visuals group on the following columns , here are the results :
Groups displayed in the visual have their entire ARP path cleared .
If a group is not displayed in the visual , but is part of the ARP path of another grouped-on column , the following applies :
* Not all branches of the ARP path are cleared automatically .
# # # Slicers and filter cards
When working with slicers or filter cards , the following behavior occurs :
For this table , we use the same example data used earlier in this article :
The following rules apply for how Power BI behaves in these circumstances .
* Power BI groups on that column
* Power BI filters on a column that is in the ARP ( up or down )
* The column has a filter card with * ALL * state
* The column has a filter card with default state , and Power BI is groupings on a column in its ARP .
This article described the behavior of Power BI when working with default members in multidimensional models . You might also be interested in the following articles :

# # Get a new app
# How to build a high performance Power BI visual
This article will cover techniques on how a developer can achieve high performance when rendering visuals .
No one wants a visual to take its time when rendering and squeezing every drop of performance you can out of code becomes critical when rendering .
# # Power BI visual performance tips
Here are some recommendations on how to achieve optimal visual performance .
# # # Use User Timing API
# # # Review animation loops
Does the animation loop redraw unchanged elements ?
- Problem : It wastes time to draw elements that don ’ t change from frame-to-frame .
- Solution : Update frames selectively .
When the time comes to animate static visualizations , it ’ s tempting to lump draw code into one update function and repeatedly call it with new data for each iteration of the animation loop .
Instead consider the following update pattern , use a visual constructor method to draw everything static , then the update function only needs to draw visualization elements that change .
&gt; Inefficient animation loops are commonly found in axes and legends .
# # # Cache DOM Nodes
To make sure that your code is fast and doesn ’ t slow down the browser , keep DOM access to a minimum .
# # # Avoid DOM manipulation
The above example could be quickened using `html ( ) ` and building the list beforehand :
Limiting your JS frameworks and using native JS whenever possible can increase the available bandwidth and lower your processing overhead . This can also limit compatibility issues with older browsers .
# # # Use requestAnimationFrame instead of setTimeout
# # From a visual on a Power BI dashboard
4 . What happens next depends on which browser you are using . You may be prompted to save the file or your may see a link to the exported file at the bottom of the browser .
&gt; If you don &apos;t have permissions to the data , you won &apos;t be able to export or open in Excel .
# # From a visual in a report
You can export data from a visual in a report as .csv or .xlsx ( Excel ) format .
5 . What happens next depends on which browser you are using . You might be prompted to save the file or you might see a link to the exported file at the bottom of the browser .

# Radial gauge charts in Power BI
# # When to use a radial gauge
Radial gauges are a great choice to :
* Show progress toward a goal .
* Represent a percentile measure , like a KPI .
* Show the health of a single measure .
* Display information you can quickly scan and understand .
# # Create a basic radial gauge
Notice that we &apos;ve exceeded our target .
The gauge is redrawn with a new end value , 1.21 million in gross sales .
# # # Step 5 : Save your report
1 . Optionally , continue formatting your gauge chart .
Once you &apos;re done with these steps , you &apos;ll have a gauge chart that looks something like this :

# Remove your connection to a Power BI organizational content pack
To remove a content pack , you remove its dataset .
title : Custom layouts with Power BI embedded content
Use custom layout to embed a report with different layout than in an original report . Defining a new layout varies between defining only a page size , controlling visual sizes , or position and visibility .
pagesLayout is a map from page name to PageLayout object . Definition :
PageLayout contains a visual layout map , which maps each visual name to a visual layout object :
To define a visual layout , pass a new position and size and a new visibility state .
- `width` , height : Defines the new size of the visual .
- `displayState` : Defines the visibility of the visual .

# # Change how a numeric field is aggregated
1 . Your visualization is now using aggregated by average .
# # Ways to aggregate your data
Some of the options that may be available for aggregating a field :
For example , this data :
Would give the following results :
A3 : Another possibility is that you &apos;ve dropped the field into a * bucket * that only allows categorical values . In that case , your only options will be count and distinct count .
Q : I have a scatter chart and I want my field to * not * aggregate . How ?
Q : When I add a numeric field to a visualization , most of them default to sum but some default to average or count or some other aggregation . Why isn &apos;t the default aggregation always the same ?
Q : I &apos;m a dataset owner and I want to ensure that a field is never aggregated .
A : Try removing the field and adding it back in .
To create a dataset that grows beyond 10 GB , follow these steps :
In the current version of large models , enable the dataset for Premium Files storage using PowerShell cmdlets . You must have capacity admin and workspace admin privileges to run the PowerShell cmdlets .
1 . Run the following cmdlets to sign in and check the dataset storage mode .
1 . Run the following cmdlets to set the storage mode to Premium Files and check it . It can take a few seconds to convert to Premium Files .
The response should be the following . The storage mode is now set to Premium Files .
Keep in mind the following restrictions when using large models :
The following list provides regions where large models in Power BI are available . Regions not in the following list are not supported for large models :
&#124; Azure region &#124; Azure region abbreviation &#124;
&#124; North Central US &#124; northcentralus &#124;
&#124; UK South &#124; uksouth &#124;
&#124; UK West &#124; ukwest &#124;
&#124; West US &#124; westus &#124;
The following links provide information that can be useful for working with large models :
* Most of our business is in the East and Central regions .
# # Use Q &amp; A to dig a little deeper
By using Q &amp; A , you can discover additional details in the data .
# # # Which segments drive our sales ? Do they match the industry trend ?
4 . Return to the dashboard .
# # Sales and Marketing Sample report
Dashboards are an entry point into reports . If a tile was created from an underlying report , selecting that tile opens the report .
The report for the Sales and Marketing sample has four pages .
# # # VanArsdel - Market Share page
Page one of the report focuses on VanArsdel &apos;s market share .
# # # Sentiment Analysis page
Page three of the report focuses on consumer sentiment .
Sentiment gap might be another area to explore . Which districts have the highest sentiment gap , how can management capitalize on it , and how can they replicate it in other districts ?
# # # YTD Category Trend Analysis page
Page two of the report focuses on the year-to-date category trend .
* Geography has an impact on units sold . The East region is the dominant region for most manufacturers and VanArsdel has a strong presence in the Central region as well .
Page four of the report focuses on competitive product analysis .
When Premium capacity performance issues arise , a common first approach is to optimize or tune your solutions to restore acceptable response times . The rationale being to avoid purchasing additional Premium capacity unless justified .
When additional Premium capacity is required , there are two options described in this article :
- Scale-up an existing Premium capacity
- Add a new Premium capacity
Finally , testing approaches and Premium capacity sizing conclude this article .
When trying to get the best utilization and performance , there are some recommended best practices , including :
- Using workspaces instead of personal workspaces .
- If sharing content only with Power BI Pro users , there may be no need to store the content in a dedicated capacity .
# # # Addressing common questions
Optimizing Power BI Premium deployments is a complex subject involving an understanding of workload requirements , available resources , and their effective use .
This article addresses seven common support questions , describing possible issues and explanations , and information on how to identify and resolve them .
# # # Why is the capacity slow , and what can I do ?
Having gained an understanding of the reason , you can then begin to investigate . Responses to the following six questions will help you to address more specific issues .
# # # What content is using up my capacity ?
Key metrics to monitor include :
- Average CPU and high utilization count .
- Active datasets loaded in memory .
- Average query wait times .
- Average dataset and dataflow refresh times .
# # # Why are reports slow ?
The following tables show possible issues and ways to identify and handle them .
# # # # Insufficient capacity resources
&#124; Possible Explanations &#124; How to Identify &#124; How to Resolve &#124;
# # # # Inefficient report designs
# # # # Dataset is slow , especially when reports have previously performed well
# # # # High concurrent report usage
# # # Why are reports not loading ?
# # # Why are refreshes not starting on schedule ?
Scheduled refresh start times are not guaranteed . Recall that the Power BI service will always prioritize interactive operations over background operations . Refresh is a background operation that can occur when two conditions are met :
- There is sufficient memory
- The number of supported concurrent refreshes for the Premium capacity is not exceeded
When the conditions are not met , the refresh is queued until the conditions are favorable .
For a full refresh , recall that at least double the current dataset memory size is required . If sufficient memory is not available , then the refresh cannot commence until model eviction frees up memory - this means delays until one or more datasets becomes inactive and can be evicted .
Recall that the supported number of maximum concurrent refreshes is set to 1.5 times the backend v-cores , rounded up .
A scheduled refresh will fail when it cannot commence before the next scheduled refresh is due to commence . An on-demand refresh triggered manually from the UI will attempt to run up to three times before failing .
# # # Why are refreshes slow ?
When the refresh is in fact slow , it can be due to several reasons :
- Insufficient CPU ( refresh can be very CPU-intensive ) .
- Insufficient memory , resulting in refresh pausing ( which requires the refresh to start over when conditions are favorable to recommence ) .
- Non-capacity reasons , including datasource system responsiveness , network latency , invalid permissions or gateway throughput .
- Data volume - a good reason to configure incremental refresh , as discussed below .
Incremental refresh can significantly reduce data refresh duration , especially for large model tables . There are four benefits associated with incremental refresh :
# # # Why are data refreshes not completing ?
When the data refresh commences but fails to complete , it can be due to several reasons :
- Insufficient memory , even if there is only one model in the Premium capacity , i.e. the model size is very large .
- Non-capacity reasons , including datasource system disconnection , invalid permissions or gateway error .
Optimal model design is crucial to delivering an efficient and scalable solution . However , it &apos;s beyond the scope of this article to provide a complete discussion . Instead , this section will provide key areas for consideration when optimizing models .
# # # Optimizing Power BI hosted models
Optimizing models hosted in a Premium capacity can be achieved at the datasource ( s ) and model layers .
Consider the optimization possibilities for an Import model :
At the datasource layer :
- Non-relational data sources can be pre-integrated with relational stores .
- Ensure that gateways have enough resources , preferably on dedicated machines , with sufficient network bandwidth and in close proximity to the data sources .
At the model layer :
- There may be opportunity to tune DAX expressions for measures and RLS rules , perhaps rewriting logic to avoid expensive formulas
- Ensure that gateways have enough resources , preferably on dedicated machines , with sufficient network bandwidth and in close proximity to the datasource .
- Power Query query designs should preferably apply no transformations - otherwise attempt to keep transformations to an absolute minimum .
- Avoid creating Power Query query custom columns or model calculated column - materialize these in the datasource , when possible .
Consider the optimization possibilities for a Composite model . Recall that a Composite model enables a mix of import and DirectQuery tables .
- Generally , the optimization for Import and DirectQuery models apply to Composite model tables that use these storage modes .
# # # Optimizing externally hosted models
It &apos;s important that the tests are repeatable . Tests should be run several times and they should deliver approximately the same result each time . An average of these results can be used to extrapolate and estimate a workload under true production conditions .

# Automated Machine Learning in Power BI
# # Creating a machine learning model
This section describes how to create an AutoML model .
# # # Data prep for creating an ML model
AutoML has specific data requirements for training a machine learning model . These requirements are described in sections below , based on respective model types .
# # # Configuring the ML model inputs
A simplified experience is launched , consisting of a wizard that guides you through the process of creating the ML model . The wizard includes the following simple steps .
The outcome field identifies the label attribute for training the ML model , shown in the following image .
When you specify the outcome field , AutoML analyzes the label data to recommend the most likely ML model type that can be trained . You can pick a different model type as shown below by clicking on “ Select a different model ” .
This feature recommendation is based on a sample of a data , so you should review the inputs used . You have the option to change the selections to include only the fields you want the model to study . You can also select all the fields by selecting the checkbox next to the entity name .
In the final step , you can name the model and select Save and train which begins training the ML model . You can choose to reduce the training time to see quick results or increase the amount of time spent in training to get the best model .
# # # ML model training
Training of AutoML models is a part of the dataflow refresh . AutoML first prepares your data for training .
AutoML applies several transformations on each selected input field based on its data type , and its statistical properties . AutoML uses these transformations to extract features for use in training your ML model .
In some cases , the final model generated may use ensemble learning , where multiple models are used to deliver better predictive performance .
# # # AutoML model explainability
You can review the model report to understand its performance . You can also validate that the key influencers of the model align with the business insights about the known outcomes .
The charts and measures used to describe the model performance in the report depend on the model type . These performance charts and measures are described in the following sections .
Another section on this page describes the detected type of the input field and imputation method used for filling missing values . It also includes the parameters used by the final model .
# # Applying the AutoML model
After you apply the model , AutoML always keeps your predictions up-to-date whenever the dataflow is refreshed .
The output of a Binary Prediction model is a probability score , which identifies the likelihood that the target outcome will be achieved .
# # # Training a Binary Prediction model
- A minimum of 20 rows of historical data is required for each class of outcomes
# # # Binary Prediction model report
Measures , such as Precision and Recall , describe the effect of the probability threshold on the predicted outcomes . You can use the probability threshold slicer to select a threshold that achieves a balanced compromise between Precision and Recall .
# # # Applying a Binary Prediction model
To apply a Binary Prediction model , you must specify the entity with the data to which you want to apply the predictions from the ML model . Other parameters include the output column name prefix and the probability threshold for classifying the predicted outcome .
The output of a Classification model is a probability score , which identifies the likelihood that a record will achieve the criteria for a given class .
# # # Training a Classification model
The input entity containing your training data for a Classification model must have a string or whole number field as the outcome field , which identifies the past known outcomes .
# # # Classification model report
The Classification model report is produced by applying the ML model to the holdout test data and comparing the predicted class for a record with the actual known class .
The model report includes a chart that includes the breakdown of the correctly and incorrectly classified records for each known class .
A further class-specific drilldown enables an analysis of how the predictions for a known class are distributed . This shows the other classes in which records of that known class are likely to be misclassified .
# # # Applying a classification model
To apply a Classification ML model , you must specify the entity with the input data and the output column name prefix .
The output of a Regression model is the predicted value .
# # # Training a Regression model
The input entity containing the training data for a Regression model must have a numeric field as the outcome field , which identifies the known outcome values .
- A minimum of 100 rows of historical data is required for a Regression model
# # # Regression model report
Like the other AutoML model reports , the Regression report is based on the results from applying the model to the holdout test data .
The model report includes a chart that compares the predicted values to the actual values . In this chart , the distance from the diagonal indicates the error in the prediction .
# # # Applying a regression model
To apply a Regression ML model , you must specify the entity with the input data and the output column name prefix .
This article provided an overview of Automated Machine Learning for Dataflows in the Power BI service . The following articles may also be useful .
The article describes how visuals integrate with Power BI and how a user can interact with a visual in Power BI .
The following figure depicts how common visual-based actions that a user takes , like selecting a bookmark , are processed in Power BI .
# # Visuals get updates from Power BI
Updates are triggered when the visual calls the `update` method .
# # Action and update patterns
Actions and subsequent updates in Power BI visuals occur in one of these three patterns :
* User interacts with a visual through Power BI .
* A user opens the visual &apos;s properties panel .
* A user resizes the visual .
When a user changes the size of a visual , Power BI calls the `update` method with the new `options` object . The `options` objects have nested `viewport` objects that contain the new width and height of the visual .
* A user applies a filter at the report , page , or visual level .
The visual gets a new update of the `options` objects when there &apos;s new data in one of the nested objects . How the update occurs depends on the data view mapping configuration of the visual .
* A user selects a data point in another visual in the report .
* A user selects a bookmark in the bookmarks panel of the report .
When a user selects a bookmark in the report &apos;s bookmarks panel , one of two actions can occur :
* Power BI calls the `update` method with a corresponding `filter` object inside the `options` object .
In either case , the visual must change its state according to the received selections or `filter` object .
# # # User interacts with the visual directly
* A user hovers the mouse over a data element .
* A user selects a URL .
By default , a visual can &apos;t open a URL directly . Instead , to open a URL in a new tab , the visual can call the `launchUrl` method and pass the URL as a parameter .
* A user applies a filter through the visual .
* A user selects elements in the visual .
# # # Visual interacts with Power BI
* A visual requests more data from Power BI .
A visual processes data part by part . The `fetchMoreData` API method requests the next fragment of data in the dataset .

There may be times when using Analyze in Excel that you get an unexpected result , or the feature doesn &apos;t work as you expected . This page provides solutions for common issues when using Analyze in Excel .
This article contains the following troubleshooting sections :
* Update Excel libraries for the OLE DB provider
* Determining whether you need to update your Excel libraries
* Connection cannot be made error
* Forbidden error
* No data models
* Token expired error
* Unable to access on-premises Analysis services
* Can &apos;t drag anything to the PivotTable Values area ( no measures )
# # Update Excel libraries for the OLE DB provider
# # Determining whether you need to update your Excel libraries
You can download the most recent version of the Excel OLE DB provider libraries from the links in the previous section . Once you download the appropriate OLD DB provider library and begin installation , checks are performed against your current installed version .
If your Excel OLE DB provider client libraries are up to date , you &apos;ll be presented with a dialog that looks like the following :
Alternatively , if the new version you are installing is newer than the version on your computer , the following dialog appears :
If you see the dialog prompting you to upgrade , you should continue with the installation to get the most recent version of the OLE DB provider installed in your computer .
# # Connection cannot be made error
# # Unable to access on-premises Analysis Services
To address this issue , you have a few options :
When you publish a report that already exists in the Power BI service , you &apos;re prompted to confirm that you want to replace the previous dataset and reports with the edited version you just chose to update .
This is a way to manually refresh your data . You can also automatically update datasets and reports ; that process is covered in another learning topic .
title : Types of filters in Power BI reports
# Types of filters in Power BI reports
Let ’ s start with the two most common filter types : manual and automatic .
These next filter types are less common , but it &apos;s still important to understand them if they &apos;re displayed in your report . Besides , you might find them useful in creating just the right filter for your report .
# # Include and exclude filters
This table compares what authors can do with the different types of filters .
&#91; Filters and highlighting in reports &#93; ( power-bi-reports-filters-and-highlighting.md )
title : Install and use the Sales and Marketing app in the Power BI service
# Install and use the sample Sales and Marketing app in the Power BI service
# # Get the app from Microsoft AppSource
1 . Confirm that you want to install this app .
# # Interact with the dashboards and reports in the app
&gt; * Sign up for a GitHub account , if you don &apos;t have one yet
&gt; * Sign in to your Power BI account , or sign up , if you don &apos;t have one yet
&gt; * Open the Power BI service
&gt; * Find the GitHub app
&gt; * View the dashboard and report with GitHub data
&gt; * Clean up resources by deleting the app
To complete this tutorial , you need a GitHub account , if you don &apos;t already have one .
7 . Follow the GitHub authentication screens . Grant Power BI permission to the GitHub data .
Now Power BI can connect with GitHub and connect to the data . The data is refreshed once a day .
9 . Select the arrow next to the workspace name in the nav pane . You see the workspace contains a dashboard and a report .
8 . Select the global navigation icon to minimize the nav pane , so you have more room .
10 . Select your GitHub dashboard .
The GitHub dashboard contains live data , so the values you see may be different .
Power BI creates a bar chart showing the number of pull requests per person .
# # View the GitHub report
Apparently Tuesday at 3 pm is the most common time and day of the week for * commits * , when people check in their work .
Now that you &apos;ve finished the tutorial , you can delete the GitHub app .
title : Add comments to dashboards and reports
# Add comments to a dashboard or report
# # How to use the Comments feature
If you are using a paginated report , you may only leave a general comment about your report . Support for leaving comments on individual paginated report visuals is not available .
# # # Add a general comment to a dashboard or report
The process for adding comments to a dashboard or report is similar . In this example , we &apos;re using a dashboard .
3 . If you want to add a comment that is not part of an existing thread , enter your comment in the upper text field .
The comments for this dashboard now look like this .
# # # Add a comment to a specific dashboard or report visual
In addition to adding comments to an entire dashboard or to an entire report page , you can add comments to individual dashboard tiles and individual report visuals . The processes are similar , and in this example we &apos;re using a report .
# # # Get your colleagues attention by using the @ sign
- Bookmarks are not captured when you reply to a conversation . Only the first comment in a conversation creates a bookmark .
# Work with Report view in Power BI Desktop
# # Let &apos;s take a look !
Once you &apos;ve added some data , you can add fields to a new visualization in the canvas .
&gt; Be sure to experiment with different visualization types . It &apos;s important your visualization convey information in your data clearly .
# # Copy and paste between reports
If the fields in your model are different , you &apos;ll see an error on the visual and a warning about which fields don &apos;t exist . The error is similar to the experience you see when you delete a field in the model that a visual is using .
To correct the error , just replace the broken fields with the fields you want to use from the model in the report to which you pasted the visual . If you &apos;re using a custom visual , you must also import that custom visual to the destination report .
There are a few considerations to keep in mind when hiding a report page :
* You * cannot * see a hidden report page when viewing the report in the Power BI service .
* When a page is hidden , when in View mode , no view-mode navigation arrows are shown .
# # Solution : Upgrade your version of the Chrome app
Turns out you actually need to upgrade your Chrome app .
title : View on-premises reports and KPIs in the Power BI mobile apps
Then in the Power BI mobile apps , connect to up to five report servers to view the Power BI reports and KPIs , organized in folders or collected as favorites .
# # Explore samples in the mobile apps without a server connection
# # Connect to an on-premises report server
1 . On your mobile device , open the Power BI app .
The mobile app needs to access the server in some way . There are a few ways to do that :
* Being on the same network / using VPN is the easiest way .
* Open a connection ( port ) in the firewall .
4 . Fill in the server address and give the server a friendly name , if you &apos;d like . Use this format for the server address :
6 . Now you see the server in the Accounts pane - in this example , it is called &quot; Work server &quot; .
# # Connect to an on-premises report server in iOS or Android
Now you can view and interact with KPIs and Power BI reports stored on the report server .
# # View Power BI reports and KPIs in the Power BI app
* Tap a KPI to see it in focus mode .
# # View your favorite KPIs and reports
You can mark KPIs and reports as favorites on the web portal , and then view them in one convenient folder on your mobile device , along with your Power BI favorite dashboards .
Your favorite KPIs and reports from the web portal are all on this page , along with Power BI dashboards in the Power BI service :
# # Remove a connection to a report server
2 . Tap the name of the server you don &apos;t want to be connected to .
1 . You must be the owner of the ADLS storage account . This needs to be assigned at a resource level , not inherited from subscription level .
4 . The storage account must have the * Hierarchical Name Space * feature enabled .
The following sections walk through the steps necessary to configure your Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account in detail .
# # # Create the storage account
2 . Make sure you enable the hierarchical namespace feature
# # # Grant permissions to Power BI services
Next , you need to grant the Power BI service reader and data access roles in your created storage account . They are both built-in roles , so the steps are straightforward .
Next you need to enable people in your organization to configure their workspaces , which enables them to use this storage account for dataflow definition and data storage . Let &apos;s do that in the next section .
# # Allow admins to assign workspaces
That &apos;s it . The Power BI workspace admins can now assign workflows to the file system you created .
This feature is a preview feature , and its behavior may change as it approaches release . There are a few considerations and limitations to keep in mind when working with your dataflow storage :
* Creating dataflows with linked entities is only possible when they are stored in the same storage account
* On-premises data sources , in Power BI shared capacities , are not supported in dataflows stored in your organization ’ s data lake
There are also a few known issues , as described in this section .
1 . Anna has created a new workspace and configured it to store dataflows in the organization ’ s data lake .
3 . Ben receives a similar error because Ben was not authorized to the dataflow ’ s CDM folder in the lake .
Common questions and answers include the following :
# Guidelines for Power BI visuals
# # Power BI visuals with additional purchases
You can use watermarks so that customers continue using the IAP advanced features without paying .
* Watermarks may only be used on paid features that are used without a valid license .
* Watermarks are not allowed in Power BI visuals with a * free * price tag .
* Watermarks are not allowed in IAP visuals , when the user uses free features .
You can use a pop-up window to explain how to purchase a license , when an invalid ( or expired ) license is used with your Power BI IAP visual .
Context menu is the right-click menu that is displayed when the user is hovering over a visual .
All Power BI visuals should enable the context menu to bring a unified experience .
This section describes the specifications for adding commercial logos in Power BI visuals . Commercial logos are not mandatory . If added they must follow these guidelines .
&gt; * In this article , &apos; commercial logo &apos; refers to any commercial company icon as described in the pictures below .
# # # Commercial logo type
There are three types of commercial logos :
# # # Commercial logo color
&gt; * If your Power BI visual contains a graphic , consider adding a white background with 10 px margins to your logo .
The following table describes the size considerations for Power BI visuals .
Commercial logos are only allowed in edit mode . When clicked , a commercial logo can only include the following functionality :
* Clicking the commercial logo redirects to your website .
* Clicking the commercial logo opens a popup window with additional information . The popup window should be divided into two sections :
* A marketing area which can include the the commercial logo , a visual and market ratings .
* An information area which can include information and links .
# # # Things to avoid
* An animated commercial logo can display animation for up to five seconds .
* A commercial logo with effects such as gradients or strong shadows .
When publishing a Power BI visual , consider the following recommendations in order to provide users a great experience .
# # # Visual landing page
Use the landing page to clarify to users how they can use your Power BI visual and where to purchase the license . Don &apos;t include videos that are automatically triggered . Add only material that helps improve the user &apos;s experience , such as information or links to license purchasing details and how to use IAP features .
# # # License key and token
For the user &apos;s convenience , add the license key or token related fields at the top of the format pane .

# Troubleshoot report performance in Power BI
This article provides guidance that enables developers and administrators to troubleshoot slow report performance . It applies to Power BI reports , and also Power BI paginated reports .
Use the following flowchart to help understand the cause of slow performance , and to determine what action to take .
There are six flowchart terminators , each describing action to take :
The first consideration is to understand if the slow report is hosted on a Premium capacity .
When the report is hosted on shared capacity , it &apos;s not possible to monitor capacity health . You &apos;ll need to take a different investigative approach .
First , determine if slow performance occurs at specific times of the day or month . If it does — and many users are opening the report at these times — consider two options :

* Adjust the stroke ( the width ) of gridlines
* Select the line style of the gridlines in the visual , such as solid , dashed , or dotted
# # Using z-order , align , and distribute
With a few selections from these gridlines , alignment , and distribution tools , your reports will look just how you want them to .
title : Separate reports from models in Power BI Desktop
# Separate reports from models in Power BI Desktop
- Commence the development of a new model , which could be either an Import , DirectQuery , or Composite model .
This article is concerned with the second scenario . It provides guidance on whether a report and model should be combined into a single Power BI Desktop file .
# # Single file solution
It makes sense to separate model and report development into separate Power BI Desktop files when :
- Data modelers and report authors are different people .
- It &apos;s understood that a model will be the source for multiple reports , now or in the future .
# # # Preserve the model interface
So , manage model changes carefully . If possible , avoid the following changes :
- Modifying column data types .
- Modifying measure expressions so they return a different data type .
If you must make breaking changes to your models , we recommend you either :
Both options allow you to quickly identify any related reports and dashboards . Data lineage view is probably the better choice because it &apos;s easy to see the contact person for each related artifact . In fact , it &apos;s a hyperlink that opens an email message addressed to the contact .
We recommend you contact the owner of each related artifact to let them know of any planned breaking changes . This way , they can be prepared and ready to fix and republish their reports , helping to minimize downtime and frustration .
# Tutorial : Create a React-based visual
&gt; * Set up your development environment
&gt; * Create a React visual
&gt; * Configure capabilities for the visual
&gt; * Resize the visual
&gt; * Make the visual customizable
1 . Open PowerShell and run the following command :
The command creates a folder called * ReactCircleCard * .
1 . Change directories to that folder and open Visual Studio Code .
This basic visual represents updates count . Let &apos;s transform it to a circle card at the next step .
# # Change the visual to a circle card
This basic visual represents an updates count . Next , transform it to a circle card , which represents a measure and its title .
1 . Run the following command to install required dependencies :
1 . Import React dependencies and the component you just added .
The error on `component` should be gone .
1 . Modify the `Visual` class , as in the following code :
1 . Save the changes and run the existing code by using this command :
You can configure the capabilities of the visual .
1 . Remove all the content of `objects` key . You &apos;ll fill it in later .
Now you can bring data from the `Fields` pane into the visual settings .
# # Receive properties from Power BI
You can render data using React . The component can display data from its own state .
1 . To send updates to component instance , insert the following code in the `ReactCircleCard` class :
In this section , you make the component resizable . Currently , the component has fixed width and height .
Get the current size of the visual viewport from the `options` object .
1 . Add the following code to the `update` method of `visual` .
Now you can resize the viewport . The circle diameter corresponds to minimal size as width or height .

This article describes how to configure your SAP HANA data source to enable SSO from the Power BI service .
# # Enable SSO for SAP HANA
To enable SSO for SAP HANA , follow these steps :
We also recommend following these additional steps , which can yield a small performance improvement :
1 . In the gateway installation directory , find and open this configuration file : Microsoft.PowerBI.DataMovement.Pipeline.GatewayCore.dll.config .
2 . Find the `FullDomainResolutionEnabled` property , and change its value to `True` .
# Expression-based titles in Power BI Desktop
Creating dynamic titles , sometimes called * expression-based titles * , is straightforward .
# # Create a field for your title
The first step in creating an expression-based title is to create a field in your model to use for the title .
There are all sorts of creative ways to have your visual title reflect what you want it to say , or what you want to express . Let &apos;s take a look at a couple examples .
You can create an expression that changes based on the filter context that the visual receives for the product &apos;s brand name . The following image shows the DAX formula for such a field .
Or you can retrieve the string from a lookup table that contains all the translations . You place that table in your model .
# # Select your field for your title
After you &apos;ve created the DAX expression for the field you create in your model , you need to apply it to your visual &apos;s title .
From that window , you can select the field that you created to use for your title .
There are a few limitations to the current implementation of expression-based titles for visuals :
* Expression-based formatting isn ’ t currently supported on Python visuals , R visuals , or the Key Influencers visual .
* Expression based titles aren &apos;t carried over when you pin a visual to a dashboard .
This article described how to create DAX expressions that turn the titles of your visuals into dynamic fields that can change as users interact with your reports . You might find the following articles useful as well .

# # Remove a data source
You can remove a data source if you no longer use it . Removing a data source breaks any dashboards and reports that rely on that data source .
To remove a data source , go to the data source and then select * * Remove * * .
# # Use the data source for scheduled refresh or DirectQuery
You can also give users and security groups administrative access to the gateway .
# # # Add users to a data source
2 . Select the data source where you want to add users .
Remember that you need to add users to each data source that you want to grant access to . Each data source has a separate list of users . Add users to each data source separately .
# # # Remove users from a data source
# # Store encrypted credentials in the cloud

# Samples of Power BI visuals
Be inspired with our gallery , including bar charts , pie charts , Word Cloud , and others .
These samples demonstrate how to harness the analytic and visual power of R visuals and R scripts .
# Refresh data from an on-premises SQL Server database
&gt; * Perform an on-demand refresh of your dataset .
&gt; * Review the refresh history to analyze the outcomes of past refresh cycles .
&gt; * Clean up resources by deleting the artifacts created in this tutorial .
The chart should now look like the following .
6 . Save the report with the name &quot; AdventureWorksProducts.pbix &quot; .
# # Connect a dataset to a SQL Server database
# # Configure a refresh schedule
# # Perform an on-demand refresh
Now follow these steps so the updated data can flow through the gateway connection to the dataset and into the reports in Power BI .
Note in the upper right corner , that Power BI is preparing to perform the requested refresh .
# # Review the refresh history
It is a good idea to check the outcomes of past refresh cycles periodically in the refresh history . Database credentials might have expired , or the selected gateway might have been offline when a scheduled refresh was due . Follow these steps to examine the refresh history and check for issues .

# Create and use funnel charts
# # When to use a funnel chart
Funnel charts are a great choice :
* when the data is sequential and moves through at least 4 stages .
* when the number of &quot; items &quot; in the first stage is expected to be greater than the number in the final stage .
* to calculate potential ( revenue / sales / deals / etc . ) by stages .
* to calculate and track conversion and retention rates .
* to reveal bottlenecks in a linear process .
* to track a shopping cart workflow .
* to track the progress and success of click-through advertising / marketing campaigns .
# # Working with funnel charts
* Can be sorted .
* Support multiples .
* Can be highlighted and cross-filtered by other visualizations on the same report page .
* Can be used to highlight and cross-filter other visualizations on the same report page .
&gt; Watch this video to see Will create a funnel chart using the Sales and Marketing sample . Then follow the steps below the video to try it out yourself using the Opportunity Analysis PBIX sample file
# # Create a basic funnel chart
Watch this video to see Will create a funnel chart using the Sales and Marketing sample .
Now create your own funnel chart that shows the number of opportunities we have in each of our sales stages .
4 . Hovering over a bar displays a wealth of information .
* The name of the stage
* Number of opportunities currently in this stage
* Overall conversion rate ( % of Lead )
Highlighting a bar in a funnel cross-filters the other visualizations on the report page ... and vice versa . To follow along , add a few more visuals to the report page that contains the funnel chart .
# What is Power BI Premium ?
&gt; * Greater scale and performance
&gt; * Flexibility to license by capacity
&gt; * Unify self-service and enterprise BI
&gt; * Extend on-premises BI with Power BI Report Server
&gt; * Share data with anyone without purchasing a per-user license
Processing is achieved by a set number of v-cores , divided equally between backend and frontend .
The resources and limits of each Premium SKU ( and equivalently sized A SKU ) are described in the following table :
# # # How capacities function
At all times , the Power BI service makes the best use of capacity resources while not exceeding limits imposed on the capacity .
Capacity admins can also make sure a capacity is running smoothly . They can monitor capacity health right in the Admin portal or by using the Premium capacity metrics app .
Monitoring in the portal provides a quick view with high-level metrics indicating loads placed and the resources utilized by your capacity , averaged , over the past seven days .
From the app &apos;s dashboard , you can click a metric cell to open an in-depth report . Reports provide in-depth metrics and filtering capability to drill-down on the most important information you need to keep your capacities running smoothly .
# # # Capacities REST APIs
The following table shows the recommended SKUs for .pbix file upload or publish to the Power BI service :
The initial report load of large datasets can take a long time if it has been a while since the last time the dataset was used . A loading bar for longer-loading reports displays the load progress .
While the per-query memory and time constraints are much higher in Premium capacity , it &apos;s recommended you use filters and slicers to limit visuals to display only what is necessary .
# # Power BI Report Server
# # Connect to Google BigQuery
When you &apos;re signed in , you see the following window indicated you &apos;ve been authenticated .
A useful design tip is to draw a transparent shape around visuals that interact with each other , so it &apos;s clear to the user that they have an interactive relationship .
# Connect to Office365Mon with Power BI
&gt; An Office365Mon admin account is required to connect and load the Power BI template app .
When prompted , enter your Office365Mon admin credentials and follow the authentication process .
# Create report templates for Power BI Desktop
Power BI report templates contain the following information from the report from which they were generated :
What is * not * included in templates is the report &apos;s data .
And that &apos;s it , your Power BI report template is created in the file location you specified , with the .PBIT extension .
* Double-click on any .PBIT file to automatically launch Power BI Desktop and load the template
Once any required parameters are provided , you &apos;re prompted for the location of the underlying data associated with the report . The current report creator can then connect to data based on their credentials .
You might also be interested in learning about * * Query Parameters * * :
In previous lessons , we already created a content pack and a group . In this lesson , we &apos;re going to create an instance of the content pack for everyone in the group .
I start in My Workspace , ...
... and switch back to the Finance group I created in the earlier lesson .
The group doesn &apos;t have any dashboards , reports , or datasets yet . I &apos;m going to use the app I created . I browse apps from my organization rather than those from third-party services .
Power BI imports the dashboards , reports , and datasets that are in the app .
When I select the dataset , Power BI asks if I want to personalize the app .
I &apos;m creating a copy of the app that I can make changes to , and disconnecting it from the published version of the app . If the app creator makes changes to the published version , I won &apos;t automatically get those updates .
But I can edit the dashboard , the report , and even the dataset , if I want .
So app are a simple way to reuse content created by other people in your organization .
title : Embedded analytics capacity planning
# Capacity planning in Power BI embedded analytics
Some of the things to take into consideration when planning your capacity are :
* The data models you &apos;re using
* The number and complexity of required queries
* The hourly distribution of the usage of your application
* Data refresh rates
* Additional usage patterns that are hard to predict .
# # # Using the planning tool
When running the tool , be mindful of the existing load on your capacities and make sure not to run load tests during top usage times .
Here are some examples of how you can use the planning tool .
* Capacity administrators can get a better understanding of how many users their capacity can handle in a given time frame .
* You can see renders happening in real time on your browser .
* The load test effects are visible in the premium capacity metrics app &apos;s Datasets page . Capacity admins can use this tool to generate load , and see how that load shows up .
# # # Reviewing the test results
To see the effects of the load test in the metrics app after the test runs , follow the instructions below . Expect up to a 15 minutes lag from the time the test starts generating load , until the time the load is visible in the metrics .

title : Getting started with formatting report visualizations
# Getting started with the formatting pane
You can customize many elements of each visualization . The options available depend on the visual selected . Some of those options are :
* Lock aspect
* Visual headers
and more .
&gt; You won ’ t see all these elements with each visualization type . The visualization you select will affect which customizations are available ; for example , you won ’ t see an X-Axis if you have a pie chart selected because pie charts don ’ t have an X-axis .
1 . Change colors used in the visual
2 . Apply a style
3 . Change axis properties
4 . Add data labels
Let ’ s walk through the steps necessary to customize colors on a visualization .
# # Applying a style to a table
1 . Select a table or matrix to make it active .
1 . Select a style from the dropdown .
Even after you apply a Style , you can continue formatting properties , including color , for that visualization .
It ’ s often useful to modify the X-axis or the Y-axis . Similar to working with colors , you can modify an axis by selecting the down-arrow icon to the left of the axis you want to change , as shown in the following image .
In the example below , we &apos;ve formatted the Y axis by :
- moving the labels to the right side of the visualization
- changing the starting value to zero .
- changing the label font color to black
- increasing label font size to 12
- adding a Y-axis title
One last formatting example before you start exploring on your own . Let &apos;s add data labels to an area chart .
Here is the * before * picture .
And , here is the * after * picture .
These are just a few of the formatting tasks that are possible . Open a report in Editing mode and have fun exploring the Formatting pane to create beautiful and informative visualizations .

title : Build a bar chart
It &apos;s important to define the bar chart view model first , and iterate on what &apos;s exposed to your visual as you build it .
# # # Use static data
Using static data is a great way to test your visual without data binding . Your view model won &apos;t change , even after you add data binding in a later step .
You add data binding by defining your visual capabilities in * capabilities.json * . The sample code already has a schema for you to use .
# # # Add data roles
The sample code already has data roles , but you can customize them .
- `name` is the internal name used to refer to the data role .
# # # Add conditions to DataViewMapping
Define conditions within your `dataViewMappings` to set how many fields each field well can bind . Use the data role &apos;s internal `name` to refer to each field .
# # # Define and use visualTransform
To assign colors and select them when defining individual data points , you use `IVisualHost` .
Color is exposed as one of the services available on `IVisualHost` .
# # # Add color to data points
Each data point is represented by a different color . You add color to the `BarChartDataPoint` interface .
# # # The colorPalette service
The `colorPalette` service manages the colors used in your visual . Its instance is available on `IVisualHost` .
# # # Assign color to data points
Selection lets the user interact both with your visual and other visuals .
# # # Add selection to each data point
Since each data point is unique , add selection to each data point . You add the selection property on the `BarChartDataPoint` interface .
# # # Assign selection IDs to each data point
Since you &apos;re making selections based only on the category , you only need to define selections `withCategory` .
# # # Interact with data points
You can interact with each bar of the bar chart once a selection ID is assigned to the data point . The bar chart listens to `click` events .
Use the `selectionManager` factory method on `IVisualHost` to create a selection manager for cross filtering and clearing selections .
You can toggle objects on or off in the * * Property * * pane .
# # # Define objects in capabilities
- `enableAxis` is the internal name that the `dataView` references .
- `bool` is a primitive value that is typically used with static objects , such as text boxes or switches .
# # # Define property settings
Although optional , it &apos;s best to localize most settings onto a single object for easy reference .
# # # Define and use ObjectEnumerationUtility
# # # Retrieve property values from dataView
The `visualTransform` is the ideal place to manipulate the visual &apos;s view model . To continue this pattern , retrieve the object properties from the `dataView` .
Define the default state of the property , and use `getValue` to retrieve the property from the `dataView` .
# # # Populate Property pane with enumerateObjectInstances
For each object , define the property with its current state .
# # # Control property update logic
Databound objects are similar to static objects , but typically deal with data selection . For example , you can change the color associated with the data point .
# # # Define object in capabilities
Similar to static objects , define another object in the * capabilities.json * .
- `colorSelector` is the internal name that the `dataView` references .
- `fill` is a structural object value not associated with a primitive type .
# # # Define default color and retrieve categorical object from dataView
Each color is now associated with each category inside `dataView` . You can set each data point to its corresponding color .
Selection is required to associate the color with the data point .
After providing a selector for each property , you get the following `dataView` object array :
You can add the following abilities to your visual :

- In the Data Movement Role – for cloud-based data sources
1 . Credentials to the original data sources
c . Pushed data – not applicable
- If the dataset is not set for refresh , there are no credentials stored for the data sources
Power BI provides data integrity monitoring in the following ways :
Static data includes artifacts such as background images and Power BI visuals .
# # # # Dashboards and Dashboard Tiles
Regardless of the encryption method used , Microsoft manages the key encryption on customers &apos; behalf .
# # # # Visual Data Cache
# # # Data Transiently Stored on Non-Volatile Devices
Non-volatile devices are devices that have memory that persists without constant power . The following describes data that is transiently stored on non-volatile devices .
3 . Credentials to the original data sources

* The application and data on the device
* Data is cached in storage on the device , which is not directly encrypted by the application itself
* Settings are also stored on the device unencrypted , but no actual user data is stored .
Power BI Mobile applications do not look at folders on the device .
# # Power BI Security Questions and Answers
* * Do clients cache web page data locally ? * *
* The gateway supports the following two communications protocols :
* No . The app publisher is responsible for the content while the customer &apos;s responsibility to review and determine whether to trust the Template app publisher .
* * Are there Template apps that can send information outside the customer network ? * *
* Yes . It is the customer &apos;s responsibility to review the publisher &apos;s privacy policy and determine whether to install the Template app on Tenant . Furthermore , the publisher is responsible to notify of the app &apos;s behavior and capabilities .

Any empty columns now appear in your visual with blank values .
# Visual types in Power BI
# # List of visuals available in Power BI
Bar charts are the standard for looking at a specific value across different categories .
Multi row cards display one or more data points , one per row .
- when you have a line chart and a column chart with the same X axis .
- to compare multiple measures with different value ranges
- to illustrate the correlation between two measures in one visual
- to check whether one measure meets the target which is defined by another measure
- to conserve canvas space
Doughnut charts are similar to pie charts . They show the relationship of parts to a whole . The only difference is that the center is blank and allows space for a label or icon .
Funnels help visualize a process that has stages , and items flow sequentially from one stage to the next . One example is a sales process that starts with leads and ends with purchase fulfillment .
- show progress toward a goal
- represent a percentile measure , like a KPI
- show the health of a single measure
- display information that can be quickly scanned and understood
- to measure progress ( what am I ahead or behind on ? )
- to measure distance to a goal ( how far ahead or behind am I ? )
Line charts emphasize the overall shape of an entire series of values , usually over time .
Use a basic map to associate both categorical and quantitative information with spatial locations .
Shape maps compare regions on a map using color . A shape map can &apos;t show precise geographical locations of data points on a map . Instead , its main purpose is to show relative comparisons of regions on a map by coloring them differently .
Pie charts show the relationship of parts to a whole .
# # # Scatter , bubble , and dot plot charts
A bubble chart replaces data points with bubbles , with the bubble size representing an additional dimension of the data .
A dot plot chart is similar to a bubble chart and scatter chart except that it can plot numerical or categorical data along the X axis . This example happens to use squares instead of circles and plots sales along the X axis .
This ensures the best combination of responsiveness , representation , and clear preservation of important points in the overall data set .
Slicers are a great choice to :
- display commonly-used or important filters on the report canvas for easier access
- make it easier to see the current filtered state without having to open a drop-down list
- filter by columns that are unneeded and hidden in the data tables
- create more focused reports by putting slicers next to important visuals
A standalone image is a graphic that has been added to a report or dashboard .
- to see and compare detailed data and exact values ( instead of visual representations )
- to display data in a tabular format
- to display numerical data by categories
Tree maps are a great choice :
- to display large amounts of hierarchical data
- when a bar chart can &apos;t effectively handle the large number of values
- to show the proportions between each part and the whole
- to show the pattern of the distribution of the measure across each level of categories in the hierarchy
- to show attributes using size and color coding
- to spot patterns , outliers , most-important contributors , and exceptions
The columns are color coded so you can quickly tell increases and decreases . The initial and the final value columns often start on the horizontal axis , while the intermediate values are floating columns . Because of this &quot; look &quot; , waterfall charts are also called bridge charts .
Waterfall charts are a great choice :
- when you have changes for the measure across time or across different categories
- to audit the major changes contributing to the total value
- to plot your company &apos;s annual profit by showing various sources of revenue and arrive at the total profit ( or loss ) .
- to illustrate the beginning and the ending headcount for your company in a year
- to visualize how much money you make and spend each month , and the running balance for your account .

title : Best practices to optimize Q &amp; A
# Best practices to optimize Q &amp; A in Power BI
Using common phrases and natural language to ask questions of your data is powerful . Even more powerful is when your data answers , which is what Q &amp; A in Power BI does .
In the following sections , we describe how to adjust your model so it works well with Q &amp; A in Power BI .
# # Automatic adjustments that Q &amp; A makes
In previous versions of Q &amp; A , measure tables would confuse Q &amp; A as the underlying table was disconnected . Q &amp; A works just fine with measure tables now .
# # # Table names conflicting with column names
In previous versions of Q &amp; A , if a table and column had the same name , the table would take preference . This issue has been addressed , so you don &apos;t have to fix this issue in your models anymore .
# # Manual steps to improve Q &amp; A
# # # Use the new Q &amp; A tooling to fix your questions
In the first image , relationships are defined between the tables .
While Q &amp; A can do some basic word breaking and detecting plurals , Q &amp; A assumes that your table and column names accurately reflect their content .
# # Mark year and identifier columns as Don &apos;t Summarize
# # Choose a Data Category for each date and geography column
# # Choose a Sort By Column for relevant columns
The following sections contain some common transformations you might need to perform .
# # # Create new tables for multi-column entities
# # # Pivot to eliminate property bags
# # # Union to eliminate partitioning
# # # Split formatted columns
# # # Create new tables for multi-value columns
# # # Denormalize to eliminate inactive relationships
# # # Add synonyms to tables and columns
title : Create advanced analytics and visualizations using R scripts
# Create and use R visuals in Power BI
# # Viewing R visuals in the Power BI service
The following image shows a Power BI dashboard with a collection of R visuals used for advanced analytics .
In the service , not all of the R packages are supported . See supported packages at the end of this article for the list of packages currently supported in the Power BI service .
R visuals are created from R scripts , which could potentially contain code with security or privacy risks .
These risks mainly exist in the authoring phase when the script author run the script on their own computer .
The Power BI service applies a * sandbox * technology to protect users and the service from security risks .
# # R scripts error experience
As another example , the following image shows the error message that appears when an R script failed to run properly due to a missing R package in Azure .
The following table describes R visuals capabilities based on licensing .
R visuals in the Power BI service have a few limitations :
* Resolution - all R visuals are displayed at 72 DPI .
* Plotting device - only plotting to the default device is supported .
* Calculation time limitation – if an R visual calculation exceeds 60 seconds the script times out , resulting in an error .
* R visuals respond to highlighting other visuals , but you cannot click on elements in the R visual in order to cross filter other elements .
* R visuals do not support renaming input columns . Columns will be referred to by their original name during script execution .
* R visuals currently do not print with dashboard and reports printing

# Connect to Snowflake in Power BI Service
To configure AAD integration and optionally enable SSO , follow the steps in this article :
# # Power BI Service configuration
This step is required to consent to sending your AAD token to the Snowflake servers . After you enable the setting , it may take up to an hour for it to take effect .
After SSO is enabled you can use reports with SSO .
After a report that is based on the Snowflake connector is published to the Power BI service , the dataset creator has to update settings for the appropriate workspace so that it will use SSO .
* If you &apos;re using only a Snowflake source in your data model , then you can use SSO if you choose not to use the on-premises data gateway .
* If you &apos;re using a Snowflake source and another source , then you can use SSO if none of the sources use the on-premises data gateway .
To turn on SSO for a dataset , follow these steps :
After these steps are done , users should automatically use their AAD authentication to connect to data from that Snowflake dataset .
If you choose not to enable SSO , then users refreshing the report will use the credentials of the user who signed in , like most other Power BI reports .
# Q &amp; A in Power BI Embedded
Power BI Embedded offers you a way to incorporate Q &amp; A into an application and allow your users to ask questions using natural language and receive immediate answers in the form of visuals like charts or graphs .
Here is a look at what the JavaScript code will look like .
One example of this usage would be a frequently asked question list . The user could go through the questions and have them answered within the same embedded part .
Listening to the * visualRendered * event allows you to save questions for use later .
title : Copy reports from other apps or workspaces - Power BI
# Copy reports from other workspaces
&gt; To make a copy , you need a Pro license , even if the original report is in a workspace in a Premium capacity .
# # Save a copy of a report in a workspace
1 . In a workspace , go to the Reports list view .
You can save the report to the current workspace or a different one in the Power BI service . You only see workspaces that are new experience workspaces , in which you &apos;re a member .
That way , members of the workspace can tell which reports and dashboards use datasets that are outside the workspace . The entry shows information about the dataset , and a few select actions .
# # Copy a report in an app
1 . In an app , open the report you want to copy .
Your copy is automatically saved to your My Workspace .
# # Your copy of the report
When you save a copy of the report , you create a live connection to the dataset , and you can open the report creation experience with the full dataset available .
When you have a report in one workspace based on a dataset in another workspace , you may need to know more about the dataset it &apos;s based on .
# # Delete a report and its shared dataset
You may decide you no longer want the report and its associated shared dataset in workspace .
&gt; Deleting the shared dataset in this workspace doesn &apos;t delete the dataset . It just deletes the reference to it .

title : Use cascading parameters in paginated reports
# Use cascading parameters in paginated reports
There are two design scenarios for using cascading parameters . They can be effectively used to :
- Filter _ large sets _ of items
- Present _ relevant _ items
# # Filter large sets of items
Let &apos;s take a look at three examples to help you limit large sets of available items , like resellers . They are :
# # # Filter by related columns
Here &apos;s how you can develop the cascading parameters :
1 . Create the five report parameters , ordered in the correct sequence .
7 . For each dataset except the first , map the query parameters to the corresponding report parameters .
# # # Filter by a grouping column
In this example , the report user interacts with a report parameter to select the first letter of the reseller . A second parameter then lists resellers when the name commences with the selected letter .
This technique can deliver even greater potential . Consider the following script that adds a new grouping column to filter resellers by _ pre-defined bands of letters _ . It also creates an index to efficiently retrieve the data required by the report parameters .
# # # Filter by search pattern
In this example , the report user interacts with a report parameter to enter a search pattern . A second parameter then lists resellers when the name contains the pattern .
Here &apos;s how you can let the report users define their own pattern .
In this scenario , you can use fact data to limit available values . Report users will be presented with items where activity has been recorded .
In this example , the report user interacts with three report parameter . The first two set a date range of sales order dates . The third parameter then lists resellers where orders have been created during that time period .
We recommend you design your reports with cascading parameters , whenever possible . It &apos;s because they :
- Provide intuitive and helpful experiences for your report users
- Are efficient , because they retrieve smaller sets of available values
Be sure to optimize your data sources by :
- Using stored procedures , whenever possible
- Adding appropriate indexes for efficient data retrieval
- Materializing column values — and even rows — to avoid expensive query-time evaluations

title : Understand star schema and the importance for Power BI
# Understand star schema and the importance for Power BI
Generally , dimension tables contain a relatively small number of rows . Fact tables , on the other hand , can contain a very large number of rows and continue to grow over time .
# # Star schema relevance to Power BI models
Star schema design and many related concepts introduced in this article are highly relevant to developing Power BI models that are optimized for performance and usability .
- Dimension tables support _ filtering _ and _ grouping _
- Fact tables support _ summarization _
Lastly , it &apos;s important to understand that optimal model design is part science and part art . Sometimes you can break with good guidance when it makes sense to do so .
There are many additional concepts related to star schema design that can be applied to a Power BI model . These concepts include :
In star schema design , a * * measure * * is a fact table column that stores values to be summarized .
However , there are three compelling reasons for you to create measures , even for simple column-level summarizations :
You must merge this query with the &quot; many &quot; -side query so that you can add the index column to it also . When you load these queries to the model , you can then create a one-to-many relationship between the model tables .
If you use your imagination , you can picture the normalized tables positioned outwards from the fact table , forming a snowflake design .
When you choose to mimic a snowflake dimension design :
- Longer relationship filter propagation chains will need to be traversed , which will likely be less efficient than filters applied to a single table .
- It &apos;s not possible to create a hierarchy that spans the tables .
# # # Type 1 SCD
A non-incremental refresh of a Power BI model dimension-type table achieves the result of a Type 1 SCD . It refreshes the table data to ensure the latest values are loaded .
# # # Type 2 SCD
It &apos;s also a good design practice to include a hierarchy that allows visuals to drill down to the version level .
- With only one active relationship path between date and reseller sales , it &apos;s not possible to simultaneously filter reseller sales by different types of dates . For example , you can &apos;t produce a visual that plots order date sales by shipped sales .
Observe the following good design practices when you create model dimension-type tables for each role :
The design objective of a junk dimension is to consolidate many &quot; small &quot; dimensions into a single dimension to both reduce the model storage size and also reduce * * Fields * * pane clutter by surfacing fewer model tables .
You load this query to the model as a dimension-type table . You also need to merge this query with the fact query , so the index column is loaded to the model to support the creation of a &quot; one-to-many &quot; model relationship .
In the Power BI model , it can be appropriate to add the sales order number column to the fact-type table to allow filtering or grouping by sales order number . It is an exception to the formerly introduced rule that you should not mix table types ( generally , model tables should be either dimension-type or fact-type ) .
For more information about star schema design or Power BI model design , see the following articles :

title : Create and manage relationships in Power BI Desktop
# Create and manage relationships in Power BI Desktop
# # Create a relationship manually
If you encounter that error , there are a couple ways to fix the issue :
* Add an intermediary table made of the list of distinct key values to the model , which will then be linked to both original columns in the relationship .
The * * Cardinality * * option can have one of the following settings :
The * * Cross filter direction * * option can have one the following settings :
Let ’ s go through a quick tutorial , to better show you how relationships work in Power BI Desktop .
&gt; You can complete this lesson yourself :
So , let ’ s create a relationship between these two tables .
Remember those columns we saw in both tables with a project name , but with values that look alike ? We &apos;ll use these two columns to create a relationship between our tables .
# # # To create the new relationship
Now , let ’ s look at the table in our report canvas again .
That looks a whole lot better , doesn ’ t it ?
That was easy . In fact , with autodetect , you might not even have to do that much .
Power BI typically sets these options automatically and you won ’ t need to adjust them ; however , there are several situations where you might want to configure these options yourself .
There are three options that can be selected and enabled :
&gt; If you &apos;re using row-level security that relies on the defined relationships , we don &apos;t recommend selecting this option . If you remove a relationship that your RLS settings rely on , your model might become less secure .
# # Future updates to the data require a different cardinality
&#124; Blue &#124; 40,000 &#124; 12 / 1 / 2012 &#124;
&#124; Red &#124; 100,000 &#124; 12 / 1 / 2012 &#124;
&#124; Green &#124; 50,000 &#124; 12 / 1 / 2012 &#124;
&#124; Blue &#124; 80,000 &#124; 6 / 1 / 2013 &#124;
&#124; Red &#124; 90,000 &#124; 6 / 1 / 2013 &#124;
These additional rows mean the best combination of the two tables now looks like this :
# # Adjusting Cross filter direction for a complex set of tables and relationships
Cross filtering both directions works well for a pattern of table relationships such as the pattern above . This schema is most commonly called a star schema , like this :
Cross filtering direction does not work well with a more general pattern often found in databases , like in this diagram :
There are actually two relationships here :

# # Connect to Oracle data sources with UseInstalledUICulture
By default , the report server uses the first client &apos;s UI culture to load ODP.NET. As a result , all subsequent connections to Oracle from the report server will be in that initial UI culture until restart of the service . This approach can cause issues rendering a report due to mismatches in UI culture formatting .

title : Set up drill through in Power BI reports
# Set up drill through in Power BI reports
# # Set up the drill-through destination page
1 . To set up drill through , create a report page that has the visuals you want for the type of entity that you &apos;re going to provide drill through for .
&gt; You can configure and perform drillthrough to a page in the same report , however , you cannot drillthrough to a page in a different report .
# # Use your own image for a back button
Because the back button is an image , you can replace the image of that visual with any image you want . It still operates as a back button so that report consumers can go back to their original page .
To use your own image for a back button , follow these steps :
Now users can right-click a data point in your report and get a context menu that supports drill through to that page .
# # Pass all filters in drill through
You can pass all applied filters to the drill-through window . For example , you can select only a certain category of products and the visuals filtered to that category , and then select drill through . You might be interested in what that drill through would look like with all those filters applied .
Although you could do this with tooltips pages , that would be an odd experience because the tooltip wouldn &apos;t appear to be working properly . For this reason , so doing so with tooltips isn &apos;t recommended .
# # Add a measure to drill through
When you add a measure or summarized numeric column , you can drill through to the page when the field is used in the * Value * area of a visual .
That &apos;s all there is to using drill through in your reports . It &apos;s a great way to get an expanded view of the entity information that you selected for your drill-through filter .
After fifteen seconds or so , the notification changes to let you know that Power BI found some insights .
title : Explore reports in the Power BI mobile apps
# Explore reports in the Power BI mobile apps
A Power BI report is an interactive view of your data , with visuals that represent different findings and insights from that data . Viewing reports in the Power BI mobile apps is the third step in a three-step process :
3 . Interact with the reports in the Power BI mobile apps .
# # Open a Power BI report in the mobile app
In lists and menus , you &apos;ll find an icon next to a report name , which helps you understand that the item is a report :
There are two icons for reports in the Power BI mobile apps :
&gt; When you hold your phone in a landscape orientation , you &apos;ll always get the landscape layout , even if the report page is in mobile layout .
Not all tiles can be opened as reports . For example , tiles that are created when you ask a question in the Q &amp; A box don &apos;t open reports when you tap them .
# # Zoom in on your data
Use the pinch gesture to zoom into your reports to examine them in greater detail . Unpinch to zoom back out again . Pinch-to-zoom is supported on Android and iOS phones and tablets .
# # # Single-tap versus double-tap interaction
If you prefer , you can switch to double-tap interaction . With double tap interaction , you first tap on a visual to select it , and then tap again in the visual to perform your desired action .
# # # Single-select versus multi-select mode for data point selection
To deselect a selected data point , simply tap it again .
# # # Using tap and long tap
A tap is the same as a mouse click . So , if you want to cross-highlight the report based on a data point , tap that data point .
When you tap a slicer value , the value is selected and the rest of the report is sliced by that value .
When you tap a link , button , or bookmark , the action defined by the report author will occur .
# # # Tooltip and drill actions
When you long tap ( tap and hold ) a data point , a tooltip that shows the values the data point represents will appear :
If the report author configured a report page tooltip , the default tooltip is replaced with the report page tooltip :
&gt; In the Power BI mobile apps , drill actions in matrix and table visuals are enabled through cell values only , not through column or row headers .
# # # Using the actions in the report footer
You can perform from these actions from the footer :
* Reset the report filter and cross-highlight selections back to their original state .
* Open the conversation pane to view comments or to add comments to the report .
* Open the filter pane to view or modify the filter currently applied to the report .
* List all pages in the report . Tapping a page name will load and present that page .
You can move between report pages by swiping from the edge of your screen to the center .
* View all report actions .
# # # # All report actions
Some of the actions might be disabled because they &apos;re dependent on the specific report capabilities .
When a bookmark view of a report is open , the name of the bookmark appears at the top of the report .

2 . The design surface is about 6 inches wide . On the design surface , you see the matrix , displaying column headings and placeholder values . The matrix has six columns and appears to be only five rows tall .
You still don &apos;t see actual data values . You need to run the report to see them .
5 . In the Grouping pane , you see the three row groups you created in the wizard :
This matrix doesn &apos;t have any column groups .
To see the actual values , you need to run the report .
Now you have a report with a matrix that wraps to 33 pages . Let &apos;s add some other features and improve how it looks . You can run the report after every step , if you want to see how it &apos;s coming along .
# # # Set page width
# # # Add a report title
# # # Add a page number
You noticed the report has a date and time stamp in the footer . You can add a page number to the footer , too .
# # # Make the table wider
Now you can make the matrix wide enough to fill the width of the page , and make the text columns wider so the names don &apos;t scroll as much .
1 . Select the matrix , then select the Company Name column .
Now the matrix is almost as wide as the print area .
# # # Format the currency
If you noticed when you ran the report , the dollar amounts aren &apos;t formatted as currency yet .
Now you can see the values are formatted as currency .
# # # Add column headers on each page
One more formatting improvement before publishing the report to the Power BI service : making the column headers show up on each page in the report .
It &apos;s time to run the report and see how it looks now .
7 . Save the report to your computer .
# # Upload the report to the service
Now that you &apos;ve created this paginated report , it &apos;s time to upload it to the Power BI service .
If you can &apos;t turn it on , you need to ask your Power BI admin to give you permission to add the workspace to the dedicated Premium capacity .
If the workspace isn &apos;t in a Premium capacity , when you try to upload your report you see the message , &quot; Unable to upload paginated report . &quot; Contact your Power BI administrator to move the workspace .
4 . Select the report to view it .
7 . Now you can view your paginated report in the Power BI service .
# Power BI Embedded migration tool
Migrating your content from your workspace collections to the Power BI service can be done in parallel to your current solution and doesn &apos;t require any downtime .
* PBIX files imported before November 26 , 2016 will not be downloadable .
# # # Start with a new migration plan
You will want to start by creating a new migration plan . To create a new migration plan , do the following .
3 . You will be prompted to sign in . You will use your Azure subscription login .
&gt; The analyze process could take several minutes depending on the number of Workspace collections and how much content exists in the workspace collection .
# # # Save your migration plan
You can save your migration plan for use later . This will create an XML file that contained all the information in your migration plan .
To save your migration plan , do the following .
# # # Open an existing migration plan
You can open a saved migration plan to continue working on your migration .
To open your existing migration plan , do the following .
# # Step 1 : Analyze &amp; Plan Migration
The * * Analyze &amp; Plan Migration * * tab gives you a view of what is currently in your Azure subscription &apos;s resource group .
We will look at the * SampleResourceGroup * as an example .
A black color means that all reports can be downloaded .
A red color means that some reports cannot be downloaded . The left number will indicate the total number of reports that can be downloaded . The number on the right indicates the total number of reports within the grouping .
You can select an item within the PaaS topology to display the reports in the reports section .
The reports section will list out the reports available and indicates whether it can be downloaded or not .
The * * Target structure * * is where you tell the tool where things will be downloaded to and how to upload them .
&gt; This does not actually perform the download . This is only specifying the structure of where the reports will be downloaded to .
&gt; This does not actually create the groups within the Power BI service . This only defines the naming structure for the groups .
You can right click on a group and choose to rename the group within the Upload plan directly , if desired .
&gt; The name of the * group * must not contain spaces or invalid characters .
You have two options .
* Select specific reports and select * * Download Selected * *
For a successful download , you will see a status of * Done * and it will reflect that the PBIX file exists .
# # Step 3 : Create Groups
This will create the workspace within the Power BI service . This does not upload the reports to the workspace .
You can verify that the workspace was created by signing into Power BI and validating that the workspace exists . You will notice that nothing is in the workspace .
You can upload selected reports , or you could upload all the reports . You can also reset the upload status to re-upload items .
# # # Duplicate report names
You will need to close the migration tool to make the change and then re-open the tool and the migration plan .
In the above example , one of the cloned reports failed indicating a report with the same name existed . If we go look at the migration plan XML , we will see the following .
For the failed item , we can change the name of the SaaSTargetReportName .
We can then re-open the plan , in the migration tool , and upload the failed report .
Going back to Power BI , we can see that the reports and datasets have been uploaded in the workspace .
# # # Upload a local PBIX file
After you have edited the xml , re-open the plan within the migration tool and upload the report .
title : &quot; Embedded data sources for paginated reports in the Power BI service &quot;
# Create an embedded data source for paginated reports in the Power BI service
# # Create an embedded data source
1 . Specify a connection string by using one of these methods :
The data source appears in the Report Data pane .
# # # Classic apps and workspaces
- .rdl in same workspace as dataset ( same owner ) : Supported
- .rdl in different workspace as dataset ( same owner ) : Supported
- Shared .rdl : You need Read permission assigned for each user viewing the report at the dataset level
- Shared app : You need Read permission assigned for each user viewing the report at the dataset level
- .rdl in same workspace as dataset ( different user ) : Supported
- Role-level security : You need Read permission assigned for each user viewing the report at the dataset level to have it enforced .
# # # New experience apps and workspaces
- .rdl in same workspace as dataset : Supported
- .rdl in different workspace as dataset ( different user ) : You need Read permission assigned for each user viewing the report at the dataset level
- Role-level security : You need Read permission assigned for each user viewing the report at the dataset level to have it enforced
From the list of options in the drop-down , select * * Session policy * * .
In the window that appears , create the session policy . The numbered steps describe settings for the following image .
When you scroll down you see more options . The following image shows those options , with additional examples .
7 . Make sure you create an alert for such an action .

title : Data retrieval guidance for paginated reports
# Data retrieval guidance for paginated reports
# # Data source types
# # # Relational data sources
- Better performance , as their execution plans are cached for reuse
- Reuse of stored procedures across multiple reports
# # # Analytic data sources
- Define query-level calculated members ( in MDX ) .
In general , it &apos;s best practice to retrieve only the data required by your report . So , don &apos;t retrieve columns or rows that aren &apos;t required by the report .
- Create a _ calculated field _ , which is a dataset field based on an expression .
- Inject an expression directly into the dataset query ( using the native language of your data source ) , which results in a regular dataset field .
We recommend the latter option , whenever possible . There are two good reasons why injecting expressions directly into your dataset query is better :
If you need to combine data from multiple data sources , you have two options :
# # SQL Server complex data types
Images can be used to add logos or pictures to your report layout . When images relate to the rows retrieved by a report dataset , you have two options :
- It &apos;s possible that image data can also be retrieved from your data source ( if already stored in a table ) .
- When the images are stored on a web server , you can use a dynamic expression to create the image URL path .
# # # Deleted query fields
When a report is run , all datasets are evaluated — even if they &apos;re not bound to report objects . For this reason , be sure to remove any test or development datasets before you publish a report .
# Create date tables in Power BI Desktop
&gt; - The date column must contain unique values .
&gt; - The date column must not contain BLANKs .
&gt; - The date column must not have any missing dates .
You can use any of several techniques to add a date table to your model :
- The Auto date / time option
- Power Query to connect to a date dimension table
- Power Query to generate a date table
- DAX to generate a date table
- DAX to clone an existing date table
# # Use Auto date / time

# How to create mobile-friendly Power BI visuals
As a developer creating Power BI visuals , the unique constraints of each mobile device must be addressed to reach as many users as possible , and provide the best mobile experience .
The following requirements are essential for mobile friendly visual development :
The following table provides a list of corresponding events on mobile devices .
&#124; Mouse event name &#124; Touch event name &#124;
The following are considered optional and used to create a better end-user experience .
The same settings can also be applied to the visuals in desktop browsers , and if needed , be overridden to adapt the visual to smaller screens .
Consider the addition of mobile specific event handlers , such as dragging and scrolling .
A visual should show a descriptive error if it cannot render on the mobile device .
# # Supported browsers and devices
When testing against the latest models of Windows , iOS , and Android devices , the developer needs to consider most of these quality aspects .
The current limitations for row-level security on cloud models are as follows :
* Only Import and DirectQuery connections are supported . Live connections to Analysis Services are handled in the on-premises model .
There &apos;s a known issue where you &apos;ll get an error message if you try to publish a previously published report from Power BI Desktop . The scenario is as follows :
1 . Anna has a dataset that is published to the Power BI service and has configured RLS .
You can return the value of a column , or you can return all rows in a relationship using DAX functions .
You can use relational functions to build expressions that include values across multiple tables . DAX will return a result with these functions , regardless of the length of the chain of the relationship .

title : Deployment pipelines troubleshooting
Use this article to troubleshoot issues in deployment pipelines .
# # # What &apos;s deployment pipelines in Power BI
# # # How do I get started with deployment pipelines ?
# # # Why can &apos;t I see the deployment pipelines button ?
If the following conditions are not met , you &apos;ll not be able to see the deployment pipelines button .
* You belong to an organization that has Premium capacity
* A workspace can only be assigned to a single pipeline
* You &apos;re an admin of a new workspace
# # # What licenses are needed to work with deployment pipelines ?
To assign a workspace to a pipeline , the following conditions must be met :
* You &apos;re an admin of the workspace
* The workspace is not assigned to any other pipeline
Workspaces that don &apos;t meet these conditions , are not displayed in the list of workspaces you can select from .
# # # Why did my first deployment fail ?
Your first deployment may have failed due to a number of reasons . Some of these reasons are listed in the table below .
For a comprehensive list of items and artifacts that are not supported in deployment pipelines , see the following sections :
# # # Why did my deployment fail due to broken rules ?
If your deployment was previously successful , and is suddenly failing with broken rules , it may be due to a dataset being republished . The following changes to the source dataset , result in a failed deployment :
* A removed parameter
* A changed parameter name
Your dataset rules are missing values . This may have happened if your dataset changed .
To deploy successfully , fix or remove the broken rules , and redeploy .
# # # How can I change the data source in the pipeline stages ?
You can ’ t change the data source connection in Power BI service .
You can only deploy backwards to an empty stage . If you have content in the test stage , you will not be able to deploy backwards from production .
After creating the pipeline , use the development stage to develop your content , and the test stages to review and test it . You can fix bugs in these stages , and then deploy the fixed environment to the production stage .
# # # Does deployment pipelines support multi-geo ?
Multi-geo is supported . It may take longer to deploy content between stages in different geos .
# # # What is the deployment pipelines permissions model ?
# # # Who can deploy content between stages ?
# # # Which permissions do I need to configure dataset rules ?
To configure dataset rules in deployment pipelines , you must be the dataset owner .
# # # Why can &apos;t I see workspaces in the pipeline ?

# Use composite models in Power BI Desktop
The composite models capability in Power BI Desktop consists of three related features :
* Combines data from one or more DirectQuery sources .
* Combines data from DirectQuery sources and import data .
For example , by using composite models , you can build a model that combines the following types of data :
* Sales data from an enterprise data warehouse .
* Sales-target data from a departmental SQL Server database .
* Data that &apos;s imported from a spreadsheet .
A model that combines data from more than one DirectQuery source or that combines DirectQuery with import data is called a composite model .
&gt; Within the context of composite models , all imported tables are effectively a single source , regardless of the actual underlying data sources .
# # Example of a composite model
* Some combination of the security rules enforced in the underlying source .
* The need to be able to view the latest data .
* The sheer scale of the data .
# # Set the storage mode
The storage mode can also be viewed on the tooltip for each table .
* The encryption settings for each source should be considered . You want to avoid retrieving information from one source by an encrypted connection and then inadvertently including it in a query that &apos;s sent to another source by an unencrypted connection .
To allow confirmation that you &apos;ve considered any security implications , Power BI Desktop displays a warning message when you create a composite model .
Using composite models adds additional performance considerations . A single visual can result in sending queries to multiple sources , which often pass the results from one query across to a second source . This situation can result in the following forms of execution :
This release of composite models presents a few limitations :
The following Live Connect multi-dimensional sources can &apos;t be used with composite models :
When you connect to these multi-dimensional sources by using DirectQuery , you can &apos;t connect to another DirectQuery source or combine it with import data .

In this lesson , we &apos;re going to edit the original app we created previously , and see how that updates the other people who &apos;ve connected to it .
I &apos;m back in My Workspace , editing my original dashboard .
Anytime I make any change to the dashboard , I get this reminder that I &apos;ve changed something that I &apos;ve shared with others in a app , and prompting me to update the shared version .
I see the app I made . This little icon tells me I &apos;ve changed something in the app , and I need to edit the app so others can see my changes .
Power BI takes those changes and publishes the updated app to the app gallery .
Anybody who has connected to my app gets a message that the app has changed , and asks if they want to accept the changes or keep the older version .
So as the app owner , you can manage the versions that your colleagues are using .

# About using DirectQuery in Power BI
* Guidance for when you should consider using DirectQuery rather than import
* Drawbacks of using DirectQuery
* Best practices for using DirectQuery
Follow best practices for using import versus DirectQuery :
# # Power BI connectivity modes
Power BI connects to a large number of varied data sources , encompassing :
* Upon load , all of the data defined by those queries will be imported into the Power BI cache .
* Visuals , or entire report pages , can be pinned as dashboard tiles . The tiles automatically refresh whenever the underlying dataset refreshes .
The situation described in the previous paragraph applies to connecting to the following sources as well , except that there &apos;s no option to import the data :
* Common Data Services .
* Dashboard tiles are automatically refreshed on a schedule , such as every hour .
With these comparisons out of the way , let &apos;s focus solely on DirectQuery for the rest of this article .
# # When is DirectQuery useful ?
* Data is changing frequently , and near real-time reporting is needed .
* Handling very large data , without the need to pre-aggregate .
* Data sovereignty restrictions apply .
* The source is a multidimensional source containing measures , such as SAP BW .
# # # Performance and load on the underlying source
# # # Security implications when combining data sources
# # # Limited data transformations
The term * modeling * in this context means the act of refining and enriching the raw data , as part of authoring a report using it . Examples include :
* Defining relationships between tables
* Adding new calculations ( calculated columns and measures )
* Renaming and hiding columns and measures
* Defining hierarchies
* Defining the formatting , default summarization and sort order for a column
* Grouping or clustering values
Almost all reporting capabilities are supported for DirectQuery models . As such , so long as the underlying source offers a suitable level of performance , the same set of visualizations can be used . There are some important limitations in some of the other capabilities offered in the Power BI service after a report is published :
# # # Behavior in the Power BI service
Similarly , editing a new report requires queries to be sent for each step on the path to produce the final visual .
There &apos;s some caching of results . The refresh of a visual is instantaneous if the exact same results have recently been obtained . If row-level security is defined , such caches aren &apos;t shared across users .
Pay careful consideration to the use of row-level security , and the configuring of the refresh schedule .
Some other general implications of using DirectQuery are as follows :
The error that would be returned would be : &quot; The resultset of a query to external data source has exceeded the maximum allowed size of &apos; 1000000 &apos; rows . &quot;
# # DirectQuery in the Power BI service
Only two of the DirectQuery enabled-sources are available directly in the service :
# # Guidance for using DirectQuery successfully
If you &apos;re going to use DirectQuery , this section provides you with some high-level guidance on how to ensure success . The guidance in this section is derived from the implications of using DirectQuery that have been described in this article .
# # # Back-end data source performance
Validate that simple visuals refresh in a reasonable time . A refresh time should be within 5 seconds to have a reasonable interactive experience . If visuals are taking longer than 30 seconds , it &apos;s highly likely that further issues will occur following publication of the report . These issues can make the solution unworkable .
* Relationships based on integer columns generally perform better than joins on columns of other data types .
* Any necessary statistics in the source should be updated .
# # # Model Design Guidance
When defining the model , consider following this guidance :
However , this filter is translated into a filter based on the fixed date , as at the time the query was authored . This result can be seen from viewing the native query .
# # # Report Design Guidance
When creating a report using a DirectQuery connection , follow this guidance :
In addition to the previous suggestions , each of the following reporting capabilities can cause performance issues :
This approach results in two queries being sent to the underlying source :
* The second query then retrieves the necessary data for the visual , including the categories that met the condition in the `WHERE` clause .
# # # Maximum number of connections option for DirectQuery
You can set the maximum number of connections DirectQuery opens for each underlying data source , which controls the number of queries concurrently sent to each data source .
The setting is only enabled when there &apos;s at least one DirectQuery source in the current report . The value applies to all DirectQuery sources , and to any new DirectQuery sources added to the same report .
# # # Diagnosing performance issues
This section describes how to diagnose performance issues , or how to get more detailed information to allow the reports to be optimized .
Similarly , we recommend to first try to isolate any issues to an individual visual , rather than many visuals on a page .
For some DirectQuery sources , this log includes all queries sent to the underlying data source . The remaining DirectQuery sources will be included in the future . The following sources send queries to the log :
The trace file can be found in the * AppData * folder for the current user :
To open the trace file , take the following steps :
All events from the current session are displayed . An annotated example is shown here , which highlights groups of events . Each group has the following events :
Multiple DAX queries can run in parallel , so events from different groups can be interleaved . The value of the `ActivityID` can be used to determine which events belong to the same group .
Other columns of interest are as follows :
In the image above , some of the less interesting columns have been narrowed , to allow other columns to be seen more easily .
We recommend the following approach to capturing a trace to help diagnose a potential performance issue :
* Open a single Power BI Desktop session , to avoid the confusion of multiple workspace folders .
Consider the following query :
That query results in the following visual :
Power BI employs this pattern because the SQL query used can be provided directly by the analyst . It &apos;s used &quot; as provided &quot; , without an attempt to rewrite it .
This article describes aspects of DirectQuery that are common across all data sources . There are certain details that are specific to individual sources . See the following articles covering specific sources :
For more information about DirectQuery , see the following resource :
title : Basic Area chart
# Create and use basic area charts
The basic area chart ( also known as layered area chart . ) is based on the line chart . The area between axis and line is filled with colors to indicate volume .
# # When to use a basic area chart
Basic area charts are a great choice :
* to see and compare the volume trend across time series
* for individual series representing a physically countable set
# # Create a basic area chart
1 . These steps will help you create an area chart that displays this year &apos;s sales and last year &apos;s sales by month .
b . Convert the chart to a basic area chart by selecting the Area chart icon from the Visualizations pane .
2 . Select one of the shaded areas of the area chart and then select the other shaded area . You &apos;ll notice no impact on the other visualizations on the page .
1 . Now select an element . Notice the impact on the area chart -- it gets cross-filtered .
# # Sorting visualization data by another field
As a common example , data that includes the name of the month is sorted alphabetically by default , so for example , &quot; August &quot; appears before &quot; February &quot; .
# # Enable bidirectional cross-filtering for DirectQuery

* contains no null values
* contains contiguous date values ( from beginning to end )
There are two likely scenarios for creating your own date table , either of which is a reasonable approach :
* The first scenario is when you use a canonical , or basic date table and hierarchy . This is a table in your data that meets the previously described validation criteria for a date table .
# # Marking your date table as the appropriate data type

Here are limitations for the initial preview :
- The integration is available in Excel Insiders Builds .
- Featured tables in Power BI datasets that use the following capabilities aren &apos;t shown in Excel :
- Row-level security datasets .
- Datasets with a live connection .
- Excel shows only data in columns and calculated columns in the featured table . The following aren &apos;t provided in the initial preview :
- Measures defined on the feature table .
- Measures defined on related tables , and implicit measures calculated from relationships .
- Rows with text columns whose values exactly match “ Orange ” or “ County ” are returned .
- Rows with text columns whose values start with “ Orange ” or “ County ” are returned .
- Importantly , rows that contain “ Orange ” or “ County ” but don ’ t start with them aren &apos;t returned .
- Setting or updating the featured table is not supported in the XMLA endpoint
- Excel files with a data model can be used to publish featured tables . Load the data into Power BI desktop and then publish the featured table .

title : Governance and deployment approaches
Over the last few decades , companies have become increasingly aware of the need to leverage data assets to profit from market opportunities . Either by performing competitive analysis or by understanding operational patterns , many organizations now understand they can benefit from having a data strategy as a way to stay ahead of their competition .
title : Bring your own encryption keys for Power BI
# Bring your own encryption keys for Power BI
# # Why use BYOK ?
# # Data source and storage considerations
# # Configure Azure Key Vault
&gt; Power BI BYOK supports only RSA keys with a 4096-bit length .
# # # Add the service principal
# # # Create an RSA key
# # # Soft delete option
# # Enable BYOK on your tenant
Before you enable BYOK , keep the following considerations in mind :
To add multiple keys , run `Add-PowerBIEncryptionKey` with different values for -`-Name` and `-KeyVaultKeyUri` .
The cmdlet accepts two switch parameters that affect encryption for current and future capacities . By default , neither of the switches are set :
- `-Activate` : Indicates that this key will be used for all existing capacities in the tenant that aren &apos;t already encrypted .
The cmdlet returns output similar to the following output :
Power BI provides additional cmdlets to help manage BYOK in your tenant :

title : Using dataflows with on-premises data sources
# Using dataflows with on-premises data sources
# # Configuring an Enterprise Gateway for use with dataflows
To create a dataflow using a gateway , the user must be the Enterprise Gateway ’ s administrator , or the administrator must have shared the datasource they are planning to use with the user .
&gt; Dataflows are only supported using Enterprise Gateways .
# # Using an on-premises data source in a dataflow
When creating a dataflow , select an on-premises data source from the data sources list , as shown in the following image .
You can monitor your Enterprise Gateway for a dataflow in the same way you monitor gateways for a dataset .
You can change the Enterprise Gateway used for a given dataflow in two ways :
&gt; The dataflow will try to find or create the required datasources using the new gateway . If it cannot do so , you will not be able to change the gateway until all needed dataflows are available from the selected gateway .
There are a few known limitations to using Enterprise Gateways and dataflows :
* Each dataflow may use only one gateway . As such , all queries should be configured using the same gateway .
* Changing the gateway impact the entire dataflow .
* Dataflows are only supported using enterprise gateways . Personal gateways will not be available for selection in the drop down lists and settings screens .
This article provided information about using on-premises data source for dataflows , and how to use and configure gateways to access such data . The following articles may also be helpful

# Tips for authoring template apps in Power BI
* Sample data makes your app discoverable immediately after installation .
# # # Connect to your API
To get started , you need to connect to your API from Power BI Desktop to start building your queries .
# # # Consider the source
The queries define the data that &apos;s included in the data model . Depending on the size of your system , these queries should also include filters to ensure your customers are dealing with a manageable size that fits your business scenario .
Power BI template apps can execute multiple queries in parallel and for multiple users concurrently . Plan ahead your throttling and concurrency strategy and ask us how to make your template app fault tolerant .
&gt; Template apps support all parameters except Any and Binary .
* Ensure all columns are typed appropriately .
* For shared logic , consider using functions or queries .
* Privacy levels are currently not supported in the service . If you get a prompt about privacy levels , you may need to rewrite the query to use relative paths .
A well-defined data model ensures your customers can easily and intuitively interact with the template app . Create the data model in Power BI Desktop .
# # # Q &amp; A
# # # Additional data model tips
Make sure you &apos;ve :
* Applied formatting to all value columns . Apply types in the query .
* Applied formatting to all measures .
* Set data category , when applicable .
* Set relationships , as necessary .
* Use more than one visual per page for cross-filtering .
* Align the visuals carefully ( no overlapping ) .
* Slicing produces rational results .
* Logo is present on at least the top report .
* Elements are in the client &apos;s color scheme to the extent possible .
* Maintain the same theme when pinning so that the tiles on your dashboard are consistent .
* Pin a logo to the theme so consumers know where the pack is from .
* Suggested layout to work with most screen resolutions is 5-6 small tiles wide .
* All dashboard tiles should have appropriate titles / subtitles .
* Consider groupings in the dashboard for different scenarios , either vertically or horizontally .
Template apps , as part of the app creation stage , wraps the cache data in the workspace as part of the app :
* Allows the installer to understand the functionality and purpose of the app before connecting data .
* Creates an experience that drives the installer to further explore app capabilities , which leads to connecting the app dataset .
We recommend having quality sample data before creating the app. ensure the app report and dashboards are populated with data .
Template apps can be published on AppSource , follow these guidelines before submitting your app to AppSource :
* Make sure you create a template app with engaging sample data that can help the installer understand what the app can do ( empty report &amp; dashboard aren &apos;t approved ) .
* Have instruction for the validation team to follow which includes credentials and parameters that are required to connect to data .
* In case a dashboard is part of your app , make sure it &apos;s not empty .
* Install the app using the app link before submitting it , make sure you can connect the dataset and the app experience is as you planned .
* Before uploading pbix into the template workspace , make sure to unload any unnecessary connections .
# # Create a download link for the app
After publishing the template app on AppSource , consider creating a download link from your website to either :
* AppSource download page - can be viewed by publicly , get the link from your AppSource page .
title : Deployment pipelines overview
# Introduction to deployment pipelines ( preview )
The tool is designed as a pipeline with three stages :
This stage is used to design , build , and upload new content with fellow creators . This is the first stage in deployment pipelines .

# # # Power BI Report Server
title : Intro to datasets across workspaces
# # Dataset sharing and the new workspace experience
- In the service , when you open the dataset catalog from a new workspace experience , the dataset catalog shows datasets that are in your My Workspace and in other new workspace experience workspaces .
- When you open the dataset catalog from a classic workspace , you only see the datasets in that workspace , not the ones in other workspaces .
- When copying reports across workspaces , the target workspace needs to be a new experience workspace .
# # Build permission for datasets
The specific features and experiences built on shared dataset capabilities are licensed according to their existing scenarios . For example :
- In general , discovering and connecting to shared datasets is available to anyone – it is not a feature restricted to Premium .
- Copying reports between workspaces requires a Pro license .
- Promoting and certifying datasets requires a Pro license .
- In a classic workspace , the dataset discovery experience only shows the datasets in that workspace .
- By design , “ Publish to web ” doesn ’ t work for a report based on a shared dataset .

title : Data reduction techniques for Import modeling
# Data reduction techniques for Import modeling
This article targets Power BI Desktop data modelers developing Import models . It describes different techniques to help reduce the data loaded into Import models .
- Smaller models achieve faster data refresh , resulting in lower latency reporting , higher dataset refresh throughput , and less pressure on source system and capacity resources .
- Smaller table row counts can result in faster calculation evaluations , which can deliver better overall query performance .
There are eight different data reduction techniques covered in this article . These techniques include :
Model table columns serve two main purposes :
Columns that don &apos;t serve these purposes can probably be removed . Removing columns is referred to as _ vertical filtering _ .
We recommend that you design models with exactly the right number of columns based on the known reporting requirements . Your requirements may change over time , but bear in mind that it &apos;s easier to add columns later than it is to remove them later . Removing columns can break reports or the model structure .
# # Group by and summarize
Perhaps the most effective technique to reduce a model size is to load pre-summarized data . This technique can be used to raise the grain of fact-type tables . There is a distinct trade-off , however , resulting in loss of detail .
# # Optimize column data types
In this example , we recommend that you set the column Default Summarization property to &quot; Do Not Summarize &quot; . It will help to minimize the inappropriate summarization of the order number values .
# # Preference for custom columns
# # Disable Power Query query load
Power Query queries that are intended support data integration with other queries should not be loaded to the model . To avoid loading the query to the model , take care to ensure that you disable query load in these instances .
# # Disable auto date / time
# # Switch to Mixed mode

title : Configure Kerberos to use Power BI reports
# Configure Kerberos to use Power BI reports
Learn how to configure your report server for Kerberos authentication to data sources used within your Power BI reports for a distributed environment .
Specifically , you will need to configure constrained delegation . You may have Kerberos configured in your environment but it may not be configured for constrained delegation .
If your report server is not configured properly , you may receive the following error .
Within Technical details , you will see the following message .
# # Configuring Kerberos constrained delegation
&gt; In order to configure SPNs and delegation settings , you need to be a domain administrator .
We will need to configure , or validate , the following .
1 . Authentication type within Report Server config .
2 . SPNs for the report server service account .
5 . Delegation settings on the report server service account .
# # Authentication type within Report Server configuration
We want to make sure that RSWindowsNegotiate is listed and the first in the list of authentication types . It should look similar to the following .
If you had to change the configuration file , you will want to stop and start the report server to make sure the changes take effect .
# # SPNs for the report server service account
Next , we need to make sure that the report server has valid SPNs available . This is based on the service account that is configured for the report server .
If you are using a virtual server name , one that is not same as the machine account , the HOST entries will not cover you and you will need to manually add the SPNs for the virtual server host name .
# # # Domain user account
If your report server is configured to use a domain user account , you will have to manually create HTTP SPNs on that account . This can be done using the setspn tool that comes with Windows .
&gt; You will need domain admin rights in order to create the SPN .
&gt; You can verify the URL by either looking at what you enter into the address bar of the browser , or you can look in the Report Server Configuration Manager on the Web Portal URL tab .
If your machine name is ContosoRS , your SPNs would be the following .
# # # Location of SPN
If we are using a domain user account of RSService , we would place the SPN on RSService .
# # # Using SetSPN to add the SPN
We can use the SetSPN tool to add the SPN . We will follow the same example as above with the Machine account and the domain user account .
# # SPNs for the Analysis Services service
For Analysis Services , we use a Service of MSOLAPSvc.3. We will specify the instance name for the port location on the SPN . The host part of the SPN will either be the machine name , or the Cluster virtual name .
An example of an Analysis Services SPN would look like the following .
We can use the SetSPN tool to add the SPN . For this example , the machine name will be ContosoAS .
# # SPNs for the SQL Browser service
You do not have to specify anything for the instance name or port .
# # Delegation settings on the report server service account
The last part that we have to configure are the delegation settings on the report server service account . There are different tools you can use to perform these steps . For the purposes of this document , we will stick with Active Directory Users and Computers .
# # Running a Power BI Report
After all of the above configuration is in place , your report should display properly .

With DAX , you can create entirely new calculated tables and then treat them like any other table - including creating relationships between them and other tables in your data model .
You can mix table functions in your expression , as long as each function uses a table and returns a table . For example , consider the following DAX expression :
# # Counting values with DAX
One common question that Power BI report builders want to answer is the following :
* How many values do I have for this column ?
That may be a simple question to answer with a table displayed in front of you , but DAX approaches in a different way , particularly when there &apos;s a relationship between tables .

title : Export Power BI reports API
# Export Power BI report to file ( preview )
The `exportToFile` API enables exporting a Power BI report by using a REST call . The following file formats are supported :
* When exporting to a .png , a report with multiple pages is compressed into a .zip file
* Each file in the .zip represents a report page
You can use the export feature in a variety of ways . Here are a couple of examples :
# # # Selecting which pages to print
For example , you can use the bookmark &apos;s `capturedBookmark.state` method to capture the changes a specific user made to a report , and then export it in its current state .
To export using RLS , you must have the following permissions :
* Write and reshare permissions for the dataset the report is connected to
* If the report resides on a v1 workspace , you need to be the workspace admin
* If the report resides on a v2 workspace , you need to be a workspace member or admin
When using the `exportToFile` API , you can pass your desired local . The localization settings affect the way the report is displayed , for example by changing formatting according to the selected local .
A job that exceeds its number of concurrent requests doesn &apos;t terminate . For example , if you export three pages in an A1 SKU , the first job will run , and the latter two will wait for the next two execution cycles .
&#124; Azure SKU &#124; Office SKU &#124; Maximum concurrent report pages &#124;
* The report you &apos;re exporting must reside on a Premium or Embedded capacity .
* The dataset of the report you &apos;re exporting must reside on a Premium or Embedded capacity .
* Exported reports cannot exceed a file size of 250 MB .
* When exporting to .png , sensitivity labels are not supported .
* Uncertified Power BI visuals
When you create an export job , there are three steps to follow :
This section provides examples for each step .
# # # Step 1 - sending an export request
The first step is sending an export request . In this example , an export request is sent for a specific page .
# # # Step 2 - polling
After you &apos;ve sent an export request , use polling to identify when the export file you &apos;re waiting for is ready .
# # # Step 3 - getting the file
Once polling returns a URL , use this example to get the received file .
# # # Step 4 - Using the file stream
When you have the file stream , you can handle it in the way that best fits your needs . For example , you can email it or use it to download the exported reports .
This is an end-to-end example for exporting a report . This example includes the following stages :

# Limitations of Power BI Q &amp; A
Power BI Q &amp; A currently has some limitations .
# # # Supported data sources
Power BI Q &amp; A supports the following configurations of data sources in the Power BI service :
In each of these configurations , row-level security is also supported .
# # # Data sources not supported
Power BI Q &amp; A currently does not support the following configurations :
- Object level security with any type of data source
- Composite models
Tenant administrators can use the tenant admin settings to manage the ability to store questions . Permissions are based on security groups .
# # Teach Q &amp; A limitations
Teach Q &amp; A allows you to fix two types of errors :
- Assign a word to a field .
- Assign a word a filter condition .
- Products greater than 100
- Products is 100
- Products smaller than 100
- Using measures in conditions is currently not supported . Instead , convert measures to calculated columns to make them work .
- Multiple conditions aren &apos;t supported . As a workaround , create a DAX calculated column that evaluates a multi-condition statement Boolean and use this field instead .
- If you don &apos;t specify a filter condition when Q &amp; A prompts for a subset of data , you can &apos;t save the definition , even if the entire statement has no red underlines .

# DirectQuery model guidance in Power BI Desktop
# # Design in Power BI Desktop
While direct connect is convenient , we don &apos;t recommend that you use this approach . The main reason is that it is not possible to refresh the model structure should the underlying data source schema change .
# # Optimize data source performance
The relational database source can be optimized in several ways , as described in the following bulleted list .
A DirectQuery model can be optimized in many ways , as described in the following bulleted list .
The setting is only enabled when there &apos;s at least one DirectQuery source in the model . The value applies to all DirectQuery sources , and to any new DirectQuery sources added to the model .
Reports based on a DirectQuery dataset can be optimized in many ways , as described in the following bulleted list .
In addition to the above list of optimization techniques , each of the following reporting capabilities can contribute to performance issues :
It may result in two queries being sent to the underlying source :
- The first query will retrieve the categories meeting the condition ( Sales &gt; $ 15 million )
- The second query will then retrieve the necessary data for the visual , adding the categories that met the condition to the WHERE clause
# # Convert to a Composite Model
When delivering reports on volatile data sources , be sure to educate report users on the use of the Refresh button . Let them know also that it may be possible to see inconsistent results , and that a refresh of the report can resolve any inconsistencies on the report page .

# # Create buttons in reports
# # Set button properties when idle , hovered over , or selected
The following cards in the * * Visualizations * * pane let you adjust formatting or behavior of a button based on its three states :
# # Select the action for a button
Here are the options for button actions :
You can build a custom navigation pane , and add the navigation buttons to it . You avoid having to edit and manage bookmarks if you want to change which pages to show in your navigation pane .
Additionally , you can conditionally format the tooltip as you can do with other button types .
# # Set the navigation destination conditionally
You can use conditional formatting to set the navigation destination , based on the output of a measure . For example , you may want to save space on your report canvas by having a single button to navigate to different pages based on the user ’ s selection .
To create the example shown above , start by creating a single-column table with the names of the navigation destinations :
Then create a page navigation button and select the conditional formatting option for the destination :
Now the button can navigate to different pages , depending on the user ’ s selection .
# # # Shapes and images for navigation
Page navigation action is supported for shapes and images , not just buttons . Here ’ s an example using one of the built-in shapes :

This is the first expression argument for our CALCULATE function .
You ’ ll use the PREVIOUSQUARTER time intelligence function to filter SUM results by the previous quarter .
The PREVIOUSQUARTER function has one argument , a column containing a contiguous range of dates . In our case , that &apos;s the DateKey column in the Calendar table .
Your formula should now look like this :
You were just introduced to several important aspects of DAX formulas :
1 . What does this button on the formula bar do ?
2 . What always surrounds a column name in a DAX formula ?
Answers are provided at the end of this article .
* A DAX function always references a complete column or a table . If you want to use only particular values from a table or column , you can add filters to the formula .
1 . What does a function always reference ?
2 . Can a formula contain more than one function ?
3 . What category of functions would you use to concatenate two text strings into one string ?
Filter context is a little more difficult to understand than row context . You can most easily think of filter context as : One or more filters applied in a calculation that determines a result or value .
To better understand this formula , we can break it down , much like with other formulas .
1 . What are the two types of context ?
2 . What is filter context ?
3 . What is row context ?
1 . Validates and enters the measure into the model .
1 . A table and a column .
2 . Yes . A formula can contain up to 64 nested functions .
1 . Row context and filter context .
2 . One or more filters in a calculation that determines a single value .
* Bring data into Power BI Desktop , and create a report .
* Publish to the Power BI service , where you create new visualizations or build dashboards

* View and interact with shared dashboards and reports in Power BI Mobile apps
# What are paginated reports in Power BI Premium ?
# # Compare Power BI reports and paginated reports
Now say you place the same table in a paginated report . When you print it or export it to PDF , the paginated report has as many pages as necessary to print every row in that table .
# # Report from a variety of data sources
# # # Create paginated reports with matrix , chart , and free-form layouts
# # # Add more to your report
# # Creating a report definition
# # View your paginated report
# # Create a subscription to your report
Here are some other features that aren &apos;t supported in the initial release :
- Drillthrough reports . Consider using URL parameters with paginated reports for drillthrough scenarios .
- Shared data sources and shared datasets .
title : Add bookmark support for Power BI visuals
# Add bookmark support for Power BI visuals
# # Report bookmarks support in your visual
If your visual interacts with other visuals , selects data points , or filters other visuals , you need to restore the state from properties .
Let &apos;s consider the following scenario : you want to create several bookmarks on the report page , with a different selection state in each bookmark .
It happens repeatedly as you change the selection and add new bookmarks . After you create the bookmarks , you can switch between them .
# # # Visuals with Selection
# # # # Use ISelectionManager.registerOnSelectCallback
When you select a bookmark , Power BI calls the `callback` method of the visual with the corresponding selections .
And `datapoints` looks like :
You now have `visualDataPoints` as your data points and the `ids` array passed to the `callback` function .
At this point , the visual should compare the `ISelectionId &#91; &#93; ` array with the selections in your `visualDataPoints` array and mark the corresponding data points as selected .
After you update the data points , they &apos;ll reflect the current selection state that &apos;s stored in the `filter` object . Then , when the data points are rendered , the custom visual &apos;s selection state will match the state of the bookmark .
# # # Use InteractivityService for control selections in the visual
If your visual uses `InteractivityService` , you don &apos;t need any additional actions to support the bookmarks in your visual .
When you select bookmarks , the utility handles the visual &apos;s selection state .
Let &apos;s assume that the visual creates a filter of data by date range . You have `startDate` and `endDate` as the start and end dates of the range .
The visual creates an advanced filter and calls the host method `applyJsonFilter` to filter data by the relevant conditions .
The target is the table that &apos;s used for filtering .
Each time you select a bookmark , the custom visual gets an `update` call .
The custom visual should check the filter in the object :
If the `filter` object isn &apos;t null , the visual should restore the filter conditions from the object :
The Timeline Slicer visual changes the range selector to the corresponding data ranges .
# # # Filter the state to save visual properties in bookmarks
The `filterState` property makes a property of a part of filtering . The visual can store a variety of values in bookmarks .
For example , the Timeline Slicer stores the `Granularity` property values in a filter . It allows the current granularity to change as you change the bookmarks .
title : Introduction to use SVG utils in Power BI visual
SVGUtils is a set of functions and classes to simplify SVG manipulations for Power BI visuals
To install the package , you should run the following command in the directory with your current visual :

# Group visuals in Power BI Desktop reports
# # Hide and show visuals or groups
# # Selecting visuals within a group
There are a few ways to navigate and select items within a group of visuals . The following list describes the behavior :
* Clicking on empty space within a group ( such as white space between visuals ) does not select anything
* Clicking a visual within a group selects the entire group , a second click selects the individual visual
* Selecting two groups , then right-clicking displays an option to merge the selected groups , rather than nesting them
Once you apply a background color , clicking on the space between visuals in the group selects the group ( compare this to clicking on the white space between visuals in a group , which does not select the group ) .
For more information about grouping , take a look at the following video :
title : Learn how buttons work in the Power BI service
# Buttons in the Power BI service
# # How to recognize a button
There are two ways to drill through in the Power BI service . Drillthrough takes you to a different report page and the data on that destination page is presented according to the filters and selections you &apos;ve made on the source page .
Drillthrough buttons can have more than one prerequisite . Unless you fulfill all the prerequisites , the button will not work . Let &apos;s look at an example .
Page navigation buttons take you to a different page in the same report . Report designers often create navigation buttons to tell a story or guide you through the report insights . In the example below , the report designer added a button on each report page that takes you to the first page , the top-level summary page , in the report . This page navigation button is helpful because there are many pages in this report .
# # Q &amp; A buttons
Since the page opens in a separate window , close the window or select your Power BI tab to return to the Power BI report .
# Tutorial : From Excel workbook to stunning report in Power BI Desktop
In this tutorial , you build a beautiful report from start to finish in 20 minutes !
Your manager wants to see a report on your latest sales figures . They &apos;ve requested an executive summary of :
- Which month and year had the most profit ?
- Which product and segment should the company continue to invest in ?
Using our sample finance workbook , we can build this report in no time . Here ’ s what the final report will look like . Let ’ s get started !
&gt; * Download sample data
&gt; * Prepare your data with a few transformations
&gt; * Build a report with a title , three visuals , and a slicer
&gt; * Publish your report to the Power BI service so you can share it with your colleagues
To follow along , you need to download the sample workbook .
We also want to make the segments easier to see in the chart later . Let ’ s format the Segment column .
We know the Montana product was discontinued last month , so we want to filter this data from our report to avoid confusion .
2 . Select the check mark to commit .
Now that you &apos;ve transformed and loaded your data , it &apos;s time to create your report . In the Fields pane on the right , you see the fields in the data model you created .
Let ’ s build the final report , one visual at a time .
1 . Select the text you typed . Set the font size to 20 and bold .
1 . Resize the box to fit on one line .
# # # Visual 2 : Profit by Date
Now , you create a line chart to see which month and year had the highest profit .
Power BI updates the column chart to show profit for each month .
Now you can easily see that December 2014 had the most profit .
Europe seems to be doing better than North America .
# # # Visual 4 : Sales by Product and Segment
Create a bar chart to determine which companies and segments to invest in .
1 . Select a blank area in the lower half of your report canvas .
Power BI automatically creates a clustered column chart .
1 . Drag the chart so it &apos;s wide enough to fill the space under the two upper charts .
Looks like the company should continue to invest in the Paseo product and target the Small Business and Government segments .
# # # Visual 5 : Year slicer
4 . Expand each year and resize the visual , so all months are visible .
Now if your manager asks to see just 2013 data , you can use the slicer to switch between years , or specific months of each year .
# # # Extra credit : Format the report
If you want to do some light formatting on this report to add more polish , here are a few easy steps .
* * Add a background shape for the title * *
Here &apos;s how your final polished report will look :
In summary , this report answers your manager ’ s top questions :
In Europe , specifically France and Germany .

3 . Here you can turn notifications off completely or choose which notifications you want .
# Use R in Power Query Editor
* Prepare data models .
* Create reports .
To install the mice library :
2 . Run the install command from the R prompt :
# # Use R in Power Query Editor
To demonstrate using R in Power Query Editor , we &apos;ll use an example stock market dataset contained in a .csv file and work through the following steps :
&gt; You might need to overwrite a variable named * output * to properly create the new dataset with the filters applied .
With just five lines of R script , Power Query Editor filled in the missing values with a predictive model .
# # Create visuals from R script data
We can now create a visual to see how the R script code with the mice library completes the missing values .
You can save all completed visuals in one Power BI Desktop .pbix file and use the data model and its R scripts in the Power BI service .
After you &apos;ve uploaded the .pbix file to the Power BI service , you need to take additional steps to enable service data refresh and updated visuals :
There are some limitations to queries that include R scripts created in Power Query Editor :
There are all sorts of things you can do with R and custom queries . Explore and shape your data just the way you want it to appear .
title : Install and distribute template apps in your organization - Power BI
# Install and distribute template apps in your organization
To install , customize , and distribute a template app , you need :
* Permissions to install template apps on your tenant .
* A valid installation link for the app , which you get either from AppSource or from the app creator .
# # Install a template app
When the installation finishes successfully , a notification tells you that your new app is ready .
In the example below , connecting to data involves two dialogs .
Once you &apos;ve finished filling out the connection dialogs , the connection process starts . A banner informs you that the data is being refreshed , and that in the meantime you are viewing sample data .
# # Customize and share the app
# # Update a template app
If you originally downloaded the app from AppSource , when a new version of the template app becomes available , you get notified in two ways :
* An update banner appears in the Power BI service informing you that a new app version is available .
* You receive a notification in Power BI &apos;s notification pane .
You will be asked whether you wish to overwrite the current version , or to install the new version in a new workspace . By default , &quot; overwrite &quot; is selected .
* Overwriting never deletes new reports or dashboards you &apos;ve added to the workspace . It only overwrites the original reports and dashboards with changes from the original author .
# Connect to files stored in OneDrive for your Power BI workspace
Adding files to your workspace is a two-step process :
# # # Import or connect to the files in your workspace
1 . In Power BI , switch to the workspace , so the workspace name is in the top-left corner .
title : Distribute content to external guest users with Azure AD B2B
# Distribute Power BI content to external guest users with Azure AD B2B
# # Who can you invite ?
Guest users only require invitations the first time you invite them to your organization . To invite users , use planned or ad hoc invites .
To use ad hoc invites , use the following capabilities :
* Report and Dashboard sharing
Use a planned invite if you know which users to invite . The Azure portal or PowerShell enables you to send the invites . You must be assigned the user admin role to invite people .
Follow these steps to send an invite in the Azure portal .
# # # Ad hoc invites
To invite an external user at any time , add them to your dashboard or report through the share feature or to your app through the access page . Here is an example of what to do when inviting an external user to use an app .
The guest user gets an email indicating that you shared the app with them .
# # # Guest user brings their own Power BI Pro license
The guest user may already have a Power BI Pro license that was assigned to them through their own organization .
# # Guest users who can edit and manage content
To help allowed guests sign in to Power BI , provide them with the Tenant URL . To find the tenant URL , follow these steps .
* Direct publishing from Power BI desktop to the Power BI service
* Guest users can &apos;t use Power BI desktop to connect to service datasets in the Power BI service
* Classic workspaces tied to Microsoft 365 Groups
* Guest users can &apos;t create or be Admins of these workspaces
* Guest users can be members

title : What can I do with the Power BI API
# What can developers do with the Power BI API ?
Here are some of the things you can do with the Power BI APIs .
&gt; The Power BI APIs still refer to workspaces as groups . Any references to groups mean that you are working with workspaces .
# # Push data into Power BI
# Azure SQL Database with DirectQuery
* Specify the fully qualified server name when connecting ( see below for more details ) .
* Every action such as selecting a column or adding a filter will send a query back to the database .
* Tiles are refreshed every hour ( refresh does not need to be scheduled ) . You can adjust how often to refresh in the Advanced settings when you connect .
* Q &amp; A is not available for DirectQuery datasets .
* Schema changes are not picked up automatically .
These restrictions and notes may change as we continue to improve the experiences . The steps to connect are detailed below .
You can find your fully qualified server name and database name in the Azure portal .

Make sure you specify the tenant ID together with the app ID using the correct format .
# # # Deploying a new model
# # # New project from an existing dataset
# # # Supported data providers
At the 1500 compatibility level , Power BI supports the following data source types :
- Provider data sources ( legacy with a connection string in the model metadata ) .
- Structured data sources ( introduced with the 1400 compatibility level ) .
# # # Cross-referencing partition sources
# # # Data sources and impersonation
# # # Overrides in Refresh TMSL command
&#91; Automate Premium workspace and dataset tasks with service principals &#93; ( service-premium-service-principal.md )
title : Deployment pipelines process
# Understand the deployment process ( preview )
The deployment process lets you clone content from one stage in the pipeline to another , typically from development to test , and from test to production .
# # Deploying content to an empty stage
You can also deploy content backwards , from a later stage in the deployment pipeline , to an earlier one .
# # # Creating a Premium capacity workspace
During first-time deployment , deployment pipelines checks if you have Premium capacity permissions .
If you have capacity permissions , the content of the workspace is copied to the stage you &apos;re deploying to , and a new workspace for that stage is created on the Premium capacity .
# # # Workspace and content ownership
The deploying user automatically becomes the dataset owner of the cloned datasets , and the only admin of the new workspace .
# # Deploy content to an existing workspace
Deploying content in a working production pipeline , to a stage that has an existing workspace , includes the following :
* Deploying new content as an addition , to a stage that already contains content .
* New content deployed to replace old content , in a current working stage .
# # # Refreshing the dataset
Data in the target dataset is kept when possible . If there are no changes to a dataset , the data is kept as it was before the deployment .
* An owner of all the datasets in the target workspace that are about to be deployed .
When you deploy content from one pipeline stage to another , the copied content contains the following Power BI items :
Deployment pipelines doesn &apos;t support the following items :
* Datasets that do not originate from a .pbix
* Reports based on unsupported datasets
* The workspace cannot use a template app
# # Item properties copied during deployment
During deployment , the following item properties are copied and overwrite the item properties at the target stage :
* Report visuals ​
# # # Item properties that are not copied
The following item properties are not copied during deployment :
* Data - Data isn &apos;t being copied , only metadata is copied
* Permissions - For a workspace or a specific item
* Workspace settings - Each stage has its own workspace
The following dataset properties are also not copied during deployment :
* Refresh schedule
* Data source credentials
* Query caching settings ( can be inherited from the capacity )
# # Deploying Power BI apps
In the production stage , the main action button on the bottom-left corner opens the update app page in Power BI , so that any content updates become available to app users .
&gt; The deployment process does not include updating the app content or settings . To apply changes to content or settings , you need to manually update the app in the required pipeline stage .
# # # User with pipeline access
Users with pipeline access have the following permissions :
* View the pipeline ​
* Share the pipeline with others
* Edit and delete the pipeline
&gt; Pipeline access doesn &apos;t grant permissions to view or take actions on the workspace content .
Workspace viewers that have * pipeline access * , can also do the following :
* Consume content
&gt; Workspace viewers cannot access the dataset or edit workspace content .
Workspace contributors that have * pipeline access * , can also do the following :
* Compare stages
* View datasets
Workspace members that have * pipeline access * , can also do the following :
* View workspace content ​
* Deploy reports and dashboards
* Remove workspaces
* Assign workspaces
Dataset owners that are either workspace members or admins , can also do the following :
* Update datasets
* Configure rules
&gt; This section describes user permissions in deployment pipelines . The permissions listed in this section may have different applications in other Power BI features .
This section lists most of the limitations in deployment pipelines .
* The maximum number of Power BI items that can be deployed in a single deployment is 300 .
* Datasets that use real-time data connectivity cannot be deployed .
* After deployment , downloading a dataset ( from the stage its been deployed to ) is not supported .
title : Introduction to use tooltip utils in Power BI visual
To use the package , you should have the following things :
This command installs the package and adds a package as a dependency to your ```package.json```
`TooltipServiceWrapper` provides the simplest way in order to manipulate tooltips .
This module provides the following interface and function :
This function creates an instance of ITooltipServiceWrapper .
This interface describes public methods of the TooltipService .
This method adds tooltips to the current selection .
This method hides the tooltip .
Now tooltip utils has ability to handle several touch events useful for mobile development .
This method returns touch start event name .
This method returns is current touchStart event related to pointer or not .
In lineage view , you see the lineage relationships between all the artifacts in a workspace , and all its external dependencies . It shows connections between all workspace artifacts , including connections to dataflows , both upstream and downstream .
In this view , you see all the workspace artifacts and how the data flows from one artifact to another .
On datasets and dataflows , you see the last refresh time , as well as if the dataset or dataflow is certified or promoted .
If a report in the workspace is built on a dataset or a dataflow that is located in another workspace , you see the source workspace name on the card of that dataset or dataflow . Select the name of the source workspace to go to that workspace .
# # Show lineage for any artifact
Say you want to see the lineage for a specific artifact .
* Select the double arrows under the artifact .
Power BI highlights all the artifacts related to that artifact , and dims the rest .
# # Navigation and full screen
Lineage view is an interactive canvas . You can use the mouse and touchpad to navigate in the canvas , as well as to zoom in or out .
* To zoom in and out , use either the menu in the bottom-right corner or your mouse or touchpad .
* To have more room for the graph itself , use the full screen option at the bottom-right corner .
* You need a Power BI Pro license to see lineage view .
* Lineage view is available only to users with access to the workspace .
* Users must have an Admin , Member , or Contributor role in the workspace . Users with a Viewer role can &apos;t switch to lineage view .
Let ’ s take a look at these basic building blocks , discuss some simple things that can be built with them , then provide a glimpse into how complex things can be created as well .
The basic building blocks in Power BI are the following :
You can have a simple dataset based on a single table from Excel workbook , similar to what ’ s shown in the following image .
Once you have a dataset , you can begin creating visualizations that display different portions of that dataset in different ways , and with what you see , gain insights . That ’ s where reports come in .
Reports let you create many visualizations , on multiple different pages if necessary , and lets you arrange them in whatever way best tells your story .
You can share dashboards with other users or groups , who can then interact with your dashboard when they ’ re in Power BI service , or on their mobile device .
Those are the basics of Power BI , and its building blocks . Let ’ s take a moment to review .
For others , using real-time Azure SQL Data Warehouse tables that combine with other databases and real-time source , which then get filtered in real-time to build a dataset that monitors moment-by-moment manufacturing progress will be the value in Power BI that they seek .
Now , let &apos;s see how this works . We &apos;ll start by taking a quick look at the Power BI service .
# What to do if purchasing Power BI Pro is disabled
# Pause and start your Power BI Embedded capacity in the Azure portal
Pausing your capacity prevents you from being billed . Pausing your capacity is great if you do not need to use the capacity for a period of time . Use the following steps to pause your capacity .
&gt; Pausing a capacity may prevent content from being available within Power BI . Make sure to unassign workspaces from your capacity before pausing to prevent interruption .
3 . Select the capacity you want to pause .
Resume usage by starting your capacity . Starting your capacity also resumes billing .
3 . Select the capacity you want to start .
If any content is assigned to this capacity , it is available once started .
# Power BI Desktop privacy levels
# # Configure a privacy level
With privacy level settings , you can specify an isolation level that defines the degree that one data source must be isolated from other data sources .
&#124; Setting &#124; Description &#124; Example Data Sources &#124;
# # Configure privacy level settings
We &apos;ll start with the mainstays of visualizations - the simple visuals we &apos;re all familiar with - and make sure you know the ins and outs . Then we &apos;ll get more advanced , or at least a little less common , and fill up your report-creating toolbox .
Have fun - there &apos;s a lot to learn here !
# # Introduction to visuals in Power BI
Visualizing data is one of the core parts of Power BI - a basic building block as we defined it earlier in this course - and creating visuals is the easiest way to find and share your insights .
title : &quot; Supported data sources for Power BI paginated reports &quot;
# Supported data sources for Power BI paginated reports
# # Natively supported data sources
Paginated reports natively support the following list of data sources :
For Azure SQL Database data sources , here are the supported authentication types :
- Basic ( user name and password )
# Expressions in Power BI Report Builder
When you preview the report , the report processor combines the table data region with the actual data from the data connection and displays a row in the table for every row in the result set .
By default , expressions appear on the report design surface as * simple * or * complex expressions * .
The following figure shows typical simple and complex expressions for both text boxes and placeholder text .
To display sample values instead of text for expressions , apply formatting to the text box or placeholder text . The following figure shows the report design surface toggled to show sample values :
&#124; Item &#124; Display text example &#124; Expression text example &#124;
The following table lists the kinds of references you can include in an expression :
When you create an expression for a specific report item property , the references that you can include in an expression depend on the values that the report item property can accept and the scope in which the property is evaluated . For example :
- For the value for a Font property , the value must evaluate to the name of a font .
Publishing your reports to the Power BI service is fast and easy .
Once the upload is complete , a dialog box tells you the publishing process succeeded and a link is provided in that dialog to take you directly to your report in the Power BI service , in a web browser .
The two approaches constitute different behavior , and it &apos;s not possible to switch an existing report from one approach to the other .
Let &apos;s look at more detail about each of these two approaches , in turn .
When connecting to SAP HANA as a multi-dimensional source , the following considerations apply :
* All the measures , hierarchies , and attributes of the selected view will be displayed in the field list .
* The resulting queries are efficient
* Given the same query , logically exactly the same data is presented to the reporting layer – even though the data is not actually imported .
All of these considerations and behaviors necessitate the following important considerations when using DirectQuery over SAP HANA :
The following list describes all SAP HANA features that are not fully supported , or features that behave differently when using Power BI .
Again , this is due to the limitations imposed by the SQL interface .
# Connect to LinkedIn Sales Navigator in Power BI Desktop
# # Connect to LinkedIn Sales Navigator
You &apos;ll be advised that you &apos;re connecting to a third-party connecter that &apos;s still under development .
You can download the PBIX file from the following location :
In addition to the PBIX file , the LinkedIn Sales Navigator also has a template app that you can download and use , too . The next section describes the template app in detail .
# # Using the LinkedIn Sales Navigator template app
When you download the app , you can select whether to connect to your data , or explore the app with sample data . You can always go back and connect to your own LinkedIn Sales Navigator data after you explore the sample data .
The template app provides four tabs to help analyze and share your information :
The * * Search * * tab lets you drill deeper into your search results :
the template app then refreshes the data in the app with your data . You can also set up a scheduled refresh , so the data in your app is as current as your refresh frequency specifies .
Once the data updates , you can see the app populated with your own data .
# # Support for SAP BW features
The following table lists all SAP BW features that are not fully supported , or will behave differently when using Power BI .
- The table storage mode is Import
- The column data type is date or date / time
- The column isn &apos;t the &quot; many &quot; side of a model relationship
If it were possible to see the rows of an auto date / time table , they would look like this :
The table also defines a hierarchy , providing visuals with a drill down path through year , quarter , month , and day levels .
If it were possible to see an auto date / time table in the Model view diagram , it would look like this ( related columns are highlighted ) :
# # Work with auto date / time
In Power BI Desktop , a valid measure expression could read :
# # Configure auto date / time option
&gt; Take care when you turn the current file option off , as this will remove the auto date / time tables . Be sure to fix any broken report filters or visuals that had been configured to use them .
# Connect to SAP HANA databases in Power BI Desktop
# # Supported features for SAP HANA
This release has many capabilities for SAP HANA , as shown in the following list :
* With SAP HANA , you can also use the direct SQL feature to connect to Row and Column Tables .
* Power BI supports SAP HANA Variables and Input parameters .
* There are currently some limitations for HANA variables attached to HDI-based Calculation Views . These limitations are because of errors on the HANA side .
# # Limitations of SAP HANA
There are also a few limitations to using SAP HANA , shown below :
* NVARCHAR strings are truncated to a maximum length of 4000 Unicode characters .
* Valid Dates are between 1899 / 12 / 30 and 9999 / 12 / 31 .

# DAX : Avoid converting BLANKs to values
Consider the following measure definition that explicitly converts BLANK results to zero .
Consider another measure definition that also converts BLANK results to zero .
These measure designs are inefficient and lead to poor report designs .
Also , too many groupings often overwhelm your report users .
Let &apos;s see what happens when the * * Profit Margin * * measure is added to a table visual , grouping by customer .
The table visual now displays only customers who have made sales within the current filter context . The improved measure results in a more efficient and practical experience for your report users .
We recommend that your measures return BLANK when a meaningful value cannot be returned .

# Query overview in Power BI Desktop
But first , let &apos;s see get acquainted with Power Query Editor .
Here &apos;s how Power Query Editor appears once a data connection is established :
1 . In the ribbon , many buttons are now active to interact with the data in the query .
2 . In the left pane , queries are listed and available for selection , viewing , and shaping .
3 . In the center pane , data from the selected query is displayed and available for shaping .
We &apos;ll look at each of these four areas : the ribbon , the Queries pane , the Data view , and the Query Settings pane .
# # The query ribbon
The * * Home * * tab contains the common query tasks .
* Adding or removing columns
* Changing data types
* Splitting columns
* Other data-driven tasks
It &apos;s useful to know that many of the tasks available from the ribbon are also available by right-clicking a column , or other data , in the center pane .
# # The left ( Queries ) pane
# # The right ( Query Settings ) pane
As progress is made , Power BI Desktop provides a dialog to display its status .
The target audience for this whitepaper is technology professionals . Some knowledge of Power BI and general business intelligence concepts is assumed .

title : Create a QR code for a report to use in Power BI mobile apps
# # Create a QR code for a report
1 . Open a report in the Power BI service .
3 . A dialog box with the QR code appears .
4 . From here you can scan the QR code or download and save it so you can :
The JPG file has the same name as the tile . For example , &quot; Sales and Marketing Sample.jpg &quot; .
1 . Print the file at 100 % or “ actual size ” .
2 . Cut out the QR code along its edge and glue it to a place relevant to the report .
title : Use and manage aggregations in Power BI Desktop
# Use aggregations in Power BI Desktop
Some advantages of using aggregations include :
To create an aggregated table :
1 . Set up a new table with the fields you want , depending on your data source and model .
- Count table rows
The * * Manage aggregations * * dialog enforces the following notable validations :
Most of the validations are enforced by disabling dropdown values and showing explanatory text in the tooltip , as shown in the following image .
# # # Aggregation tables are hidden
To work correctly for aggregations , RLS expressions should filter both the aggregation table and the detail table .
# # Aggregation based on relationships
Dimensional models typically use * aggregations based on relationships * . Power BI datasets from data warehouses and data marts resemble star / snowflake schemas , with relationships between dimension tables and fact tables .
- Product Subcategory
The following image shows this model .
# # # Strong vs. weak relationships
Aggregation hits based on relationships require strong relationships .
Strong relationships include the following storage mode combinations , where both tables are from a single source :
The only case where a * cross-source * relationship is considered strong is if both tables are set to Import . Many-to-many relationships are always considered weak .
# # # Relationship-based aggregation query examples
# # Aggregation based on GroupBy columns
To enable interactive analysis on this dataset , you can add an aggregation table that groups by most of the attributes , but excludes the high-cardinality attributes like longitude and latitude . This dramatically reduces the number of rows , and is small enough to comfortably fit into an in-memory cache .
# # # GroupBy aggregation query example
# # # Combined aggregation query examples
Aggregation precedence allows multiple aggregation tables to be considered by a single subquery .
The memory footprint of this model is relatively small , but it unlocks a huge dataset . It represents a balanced architecture because it spreads the query load across components of the architecture , utilizing them based on their strengths .
# # Detect whether queries hit or miss aggregations
The following JSON snippet shows an example of the output of the event when an aggregation is used .

5 . The Web service and Web portal URLs should be accessible successfully after making the above-mentioned changes .
7 . Add the following registry entry :
After that , we can access the URLs on the server as well .
# # Configure Power BI Report Server to work with Kerberos
# # # 1 . Configure the authentication type
We want to make sure that RSWindowsNegotiate is listed and is first in the list of authentication types . It should look similar to the following .
Open the command prompt as an administrator and perform the following steps .
# # # 3 . Configure delegation settings
We have to configure the delegation settings on the report server service account .
1 . Open Active Directory Users and Computers .
2 . Open the Properties of the report server service account within Active Directory Users and Computers .
3 . We want to configure constrained delegation with protocol transiting . With constrained delegation , we need to be explicit about which services we want to delegate to .
It begins with MSSQLSVC .
1 . Add the SPNs .
These steps help configure Power BI Report Server to work with Kerberos authentication mechanism and get the test connection to data source working on your local machine .
# # # Ensure the Connector is trusted for delegation
Ensure the Connector is trusted for delegation to the SPN added to the report server application pool account .
To configure KCD , repeat the following steps for each connector machine .
2 . Find the computer that the connector is running on .
# # Publish through Azure AD Application Proxy

title : Use row-level security with Power BI embedded content
# Row-level security with Power BI Embedded
# # Adding roles with Power BI Desktop
Here are a few things to notice with this schema :
Here &apos;s how :
# # Applying user and role to an embed token
Now that you have your Power BI Desktop roles configured , some more work needs to be done in your application to take advantage of the roles .
The API accepts a list of identities with indication of the relevant datasets . For RLS to work , you need to pass the below pieces as part of the identity .
Use the following code below as an example :
Now , with all the pieces together , when someone logs into your application to view this artifact , they &apos;ll only see the data that they &apos;re allowed to see , as defined by our row-level security .
# # Working with Analysis Services live connections
Row-level security can be used with Analysis Services live connections for on-premises servers . There are a few specific concepts that you should understand when using this type of connection .
The effective identity that is provided for the username property must be a Windows user with permissions on the Analysis Services server .
# # # On-premises data gateway configuration
# # # Use of roles
Roles can be provided with the identity in an embed token . If no role is provided , the username that was provided can be used to resolve the associated roles .
# # # Using the CustomData feature
&gt; The CustomData username can only be 256 characters long .
You can use it inside the role DAX query , and you can use it without any role in a measure DAX query .
# # # # CustomData SDK Additions
The CustomData string property was added to our effective identity in the token generation scenario .
The identity can be created with custom data using the following call :
If you &apos;re calling the REST API , you can add custom data inside each identity , for example :
2 . Create a Role in the Analysis Services server .
6 . Build a PBI report and publish it to a workspace with dedicated capacity .
&gt; When you &apos;re ready to deploy your application to production , the master user account field or option should not be visible to the end user .
8 . Now you can view the report in your application before applying the Custom data value ( s ) to see all the data your report holds .
Then apply the Custom data value ( s ) to see how the report displays a different set of data .
# # Using RLS vs. JavaScript filters
# # Token-based Identity with Azure SQL Database
# # # Token-based Identity SDK additions
The identity blob property was added to our effective identity in the token generation scenario .
The IdentityBlob type is a simple JSON structure holding a value string property
The EffectiveIdentity can be created with identity blob using the following call :
Identity blob can be created using the following call .
# # # Token-based Identity REST API Usage
# # On-premises data gateway with service principal
You can &apos;t set this permission using the admin portal . This permission is only set with the API . In the admin portal , you see an indication for users and SPNs with such permissions .
* Assignment of users to roles within the Power BI service doesn &apos;t affect RLS when using an embed token .
* While the Power BI service doesn &apos;t apply RLS setting to admins or members with edit permissions , when you supply an identity with an embed token , it applies to the data .
* Analysis Services live connections are supported for on-premises servers .
* A list of identities enables multiple identity tokens for dashboard embedding . For all others artifacts , the list contains a single identity .
# # # Token-based Identity limitations
* You can use RLS only if you have a dedicated capacity .
* RLS doesn &apos;t work with SQL Server on-premises .

- Power BI paginated features and capabilities work in your favor . Many such report scenarios are described later in this article .
There are many compelling scenarios when you might favor developing a Power BI paginated report . Many are features or capabilities not supported by Power BI reports .
title : View your data offline in the Power BI mobile apps
# View your data offline in the Power BI mobile apps
One advantage of viewing Power BI in a mobile app rather than in a mobile browser is that you can see your data even when you &apos;re not connected to a network .
By default , Power BI refreshes the data frequently so you get up-to-date answers to your business questions any time , even while commuting or roaming .
# # Data access while you &apos;re offline
While you &apos;re offline , you can access and interact with dashboards you &apos;ve accessed previously from the mobile app .
&gt; Reports based on DirectQuery are not cached and are not available offline .
You can turn off background refresh , for example , to avoid network usage . Check the settings on your device .
When you &apos;re offline with Power BI on your mobile device , you may encounter these limitations :
* Whole Excel workbooks in Power BI aren &apos;t available offline .
* Paginated reports ( RDL ) are not available while the network is offline .

title : Power BI Embedded performance best practices
This article provides recommendations for faster rendering of reports , dashboards , and tiles in your application .
# # Update tools and SDK packages
Keep tools and SDK packages up-to-date .
# # # Filters , bookmarks , and slicers
Organizations with Power BI Premium capacity or Power BI Embedded capacity can take advantage of query caching to speed up reports associated with a dataset .
&gt; Use the bootstrap API when it &apos;s possible to generate the iframe before it &apos;s visible to the end user .
To measure embedded performance , you may use two events :
Cached data is rendered when available but no additional event is generated .
To examine the performance of the report elements , you might use the Performance Analyzer in Power BI Desktop .
The Performance Analyzer will allow you to see and record logs that measure how each of your report elements performs .
&gt; Always remember to compare the embedded report performance to the performance on powerbi.com. This might help you understand the origin of your performance issues
# Frequently asked questions about Power BI Embedded
Developers and software companies , also known as independent software vendors ( ISVs ) , coding applications .
Power BI is a software-as-a-service analytics solution that gives organizations a single view of their most critical business data .
# # # How many embed tokens can I create ?
# # # Where can I learn more about capacity and SKUs in Power BI embedded analytics ?
* Sign in to your organizational directory ( Microsoft accounts aren &apos;t supported ) .
* You need to have an Azure subscription in your organizational directory .
# # # Can my capacity scale automatically to adjust to my app consumption ?
While there &apos;s no automatic scaling now , all the APIs are available to scale at any time .
When a user is granted permissions to a workspace , app , or artifact , it might not be immediately available through API calls .
The result can either be a missing artifact in a &apos; GET &apos; API response , or an error when trying to use the artifact .
# # # How can I find my PBI tenant region ?
You can use the PBI portal to find your PBI Tenant region .
* You can create PBIE for your tenant with subscription type CSP
# # # Why do I get an unsupported account message ?
# # # Can I use APIs to create and manage Azure capacities ?
Yes , there are Powershell cmdlets and Azure Resource Manager REST APIs you can use to create and manage PBIE resources .
Available regions ( 16 - same regions as Power BI )
* Brazil ( 1 ) - Brazil South
* United Kingdom ( 1 ) - UK South
An ISV can implement their own authentication and authorization for their applications .
You can use your existing directory if you already have an Azure AD tenant . You can also create a new Azure AD tenant for your embedded application content security .
# # # What object ID is the service principal object ID ?
* Scale up / down
* Add capacity admins
* Pause / resume service
Use PowerBI.com to assign / un-assign workspaces to your Power BI Embedded capacity .
# # # What content pack data types can you embed ?
There &apos;s often confusion around when to use RLS versus JavaScript filters , because one method is about controlling what a specific user can see , and the other is about optimizing the user &apos;s view .
# # # Can you manage an On-premises data gateway with service principal ?
With a master account , you can install a data gateway , add users to the gateway , connect to data sources , and do other administrative tasks .
# # # Can you sign into the Power BI service with service principal ?
No - you can &apos;t sign into Power BI using service principal .
Also , you can &apos;t consume content as a user in external applications ( SaaS embed ) , only when you generate an embed token .
# # # What are the best practices to improve performance ?
Customers may change their usage on an hourly basis . There &apos;s no monthly or annual commitment for the Power BI Embedded service .
# # # Can I get started for free ?
There &apos;s no special Azure pricing for non-profit and educational entities .
# # # When is Power BI Workspace Collection support discontinued ?
Some of the features are :
* Capacity billing model .
# # # What is the Embedding setup tool ?
# # # Which solution should I choose ?
# # # I &apos;ve downloaded the sample app , which solution do I choose ?
# # # How can I edit my registered application ?
title : Power BI data source prerequisites
# Power BI data source prerequisites
&gt; Excel files that have an .xlsx extension do not require a separate provider installation .
# Automatic page refresh in Power BI
When using automatic page refresh , there are two refresh types available : fixed interval and change detection .
This refresh type allows you to update all visuals in a report page based on a constant interval such as one second or five minutes . When that specific interval is reached , all visuals in that page send an update query to the data source and update accordingly .
# # Authoring reports with automatic page refresh in Power BI Desktop
1 . Turns page refresh on or off .
3 . Inputs and information ( depending on refresh type )
When clicking on show details Power BI will provide further information on :
- If the feature is enabled by your admin ( only when logged into your Power BI account )
- The minimum interval allowed by your admin ( only when logged into your Power BI account )
- Actual rate of refresh ( usually longer than your selected interval )
- Last refresh time
# # # Change detection setup
Then , back on the page refresh section , you will see the information of which measure is being used for change detection and the defined interval for your reference .
&gt; Only one change detection measure is allowed per model .
# # Determining the refresh interval
As a best practice , the refresh interval should at least match your expected new data arrival rate :
* If new data arrives every second , set the interval to one second .
For low refresh intervals like one second , take factors like the following into consideration :
- The type of the DirectQuery data source
- The load your queries create on it
- The distance of your report viewers from the capacity &apos;s datacenter
This image shows the results of a DirectQuery source in Performance Analyzer :
Let &apos;s consider some other characteristics of this data source :
- Data arrives at a rate of 2 seconds
- Performance Analyzer shows a maximum query + display time of approximately 4.9 seconds ( 4,688 milliseconds )
- The data source is configured to handle approximately 1,000 concurrent queries per second
- You expect approximately 10 users to be viewing the report concurrently
So that results in the following equation :
For the same scenario we discussed before :
# # Automatic page refresh in the Power BI service
# # # Page refresh intervals
The page refresh types and intervals allowed in the Power BI service are affected by the report &apos;s workspace type . This applies to these scenarios :
* Publishing a report into a workspace that has automatic page refresh enabled
* Editing a page refresh interval that &apos;s already in a workspace
* Creating a report directly in the service
# # # Restrictions on refresh intervals
In the Power BI service , restrictions on automatic page refresh apply based on the workspace where the report is published , whether you &apos;re using Premium services , and the Premium capacity admin settings .
To clarify how these restrictions work , let &apos;s start with some background on capacities and workspaces .
Here are some details for the two workspace scenarios :
&#124; Storage mode &#124; Dedicated capacity &#124; Shared capacity &#124;
* Composite models that have at least one DirectQuery data source are supported .
* You can only have one change detection measure per dataset .
* There can only be a maximum of 10 models with change detection measure in a Power BI tenant .
Automatic page refresh is useful for monitoring scenarios and exploring fast-changing data . But sometimes it can put undue load on the capacity or data source .
To prevent undue load on data sources , Power BI has these safeguards :
- All automatic page refresh queries run at a lower priority to ensure that interactive queries ( like page load and cross-filtering visuals ) take precedence .
There are two areas where you could still encounter performance bottlenecks :
Low-priority queries consist of automatic page refresh queries and model refresh queries . There &apos;s currently no way to distinguish between the load from automatic page refresh and model refresh queries .
If you notice that your capacity is overloaded with low-priority queries , there are a few actions you can take :
- Request a larger premium SKU .
- Ask the report owner to lower the refresh interval .
- In the capacity admin portal , you can :
- Turn off automatic page refresh for that capacity .
- Raise the minimum refresh interval , which will affect all reports on that capacity .
* It takes up to 5 minutes for automatic page refresh setting changes made in the capacity admin UI to propagate to reports .
* In addition to turning on automatic page refresh for the capacity , you also need to turn it on for the pages of a report where you want to enable it .
* Both refresh types are managed separately so make sure that the type of refresh you are enabling is turned on .
- If your visuals reference Import tables , this behavior is expected . Automatic page refresh isn &apos;t supported for Import .
- See the first question in this section .
* Try refreshing the page to see if the problem resolves itself .
* If your queries are taking longer to run , your refresh interval will be delayed . Automatic page refresh waits for all queries to finish before running new ones .
* Your capacity admin might have set a minimum refresh interval that &apos;s higher than the one you set in your report . Ask your capacity admin to lower the minimum refresh interval .
* * Are automatic page refresh queries served from the cache ? * *
* No . All automatic page refresh queries bypass any cached data .
* * My change detection measure is not triggering any updates * *
* Check whether you uploaded to a workspace with an attached Premium capacity . If you haven &apos;t , change detection will not work .

Whether you &apos;re creating a new column or measure , it &apos;s important to know the general format of table names in DAX :
The following image shows a DAX formula being created in Power BI :
It &apos;s best practice to * always * do the following :
* No spaces in table names
* Always include the table name in formulas ( don &apos;t omit it , even though DAX lets you )
The required elements for a calculated column are the following :
* a new column name
* at least one function or expression
The required elements for a measure are the same as they are for a calculated column :
* a new measure name
title : High-contrast mode support in Power BI visuals
# High-contrast mode support in Power BI visuals
# # # Detect that Power BI is in high-contrast mode
If `host.colorPalette.isHighContrast` is `true` , high-contrast mode is active and the visual should draw itself accordingly .
# # # Get high-contrast colors
In high-contrast mode , your visual should limit itself to the following settings :
During initialization , you can store the following values :
Or you can store the `host` object during initialization and access the relevant `colorPalette` properties during update .
The specific implementations of high-contrast support vary from visual to visual and depend on the details of the graphic design . To keep important details easy to distinguish with the limited colors , high-contrast mode ordinarily requires a design that &apos;s slightly different from the default mode .
Power BI native visuals follow these guidelines :
* All data points use the same color ( foreground ) .
* Thick shapes are drawn as outlines , with thick strokes ( at least two pixels ) and background color fill .
* When data points are relevant , they &apos;re distinguished by different marker shapes , and data lines are distinguished by different dashing .
* When a data element is highlighted , all other elements change their opacity to 40 % .
* For slicers , active filter elements use foreground-selected color .
In the following sample bar chart , for example , all bars are drawn with two pixels of thick foreground outline and background fill . Compare the way it looks with default colors and with a couple of high-contrast themes :
The next section shows one place in the `visualTransform` function that was changed to support high contrast . It &apos;s called as part of rendering during the update .
This article provides best practices for designing dataflows in Power BI . You can use this guidance to learn how to create dataflows , apply these practices to your own dataflows .
&gt; The recommendations made in this article are guidelines . For each best practice in this article , there may be legitimate reasons to deviate from this guidance .
# # # Split ingestion and transformation to use the enhanced compute engine
Splitting dataflows is also beneficial for diagnosing and debugging refresh issues , especially when working with sources that have throttling limits .
# # # Perform actions that can use the enhanced compute engine
Ensure you make use of the enhanced compute engine by ensuring you perform joins and filter transformations first in a computed entity before performing other types of transformations .
# # # Split dataflows when connecting to SharePoint
# # # Avoid scheduling refresh for linked entities inside the same workspace
If you &apos;re regularly being locked out of your dataflows that contain linked entities , it may be a result of corresponding , dependent dataflow inside the same workspace are locked during dataflow refresh . Such locking provides transactional accuracy and ensures both dataflows successfully refresh , but it can block you from editing .
* Avoid setting a refresh schedule for a linked dataflow in the same workspace as the source dataflow
* If you want to configure a refresh schedule separately , and want to avoid the locking behavior , separate the dataflow in a separate workspace .
# # # Ensure capacity is in the same region
Dataflows do not currently support multi-geo regions . The Premium capacity must be in the same region as your Power BI tenant .
# # # Separate on-premises sources from cloud sources
# # # Separate dataflows into a separate capacity
If you are experiencing throttling limits , or seeing regular failures for your dataflows due to memory limits on your capacity , consider separating your dataflows , or scaling up your Premium capacity for additional memory .

title : Intro to dashboards for Power BI designers
# Introduction to dashboards for Power BI designers
The visualizations on a dashboard originate from reports and each report is based on a dataset . One way to think of a dashboard is as an entryway to the underlying reports and datasets . Selecting a visualization takes you to the report ( and dataset ) that it &apos;s based on .
A dashboard isn &apos;t just a pretty picture . It &apos;s highly interactive and the tiles update as the underlying data changes .
# # Who can create a dashboard ?
title : Annotate and share in Power BI mobile apps

# # Open a report for annotating
1 . Open a report .
# # Open a visual for annotating
1 . In a report , tap a visual , then tap the expand icon to open it in focus mode .
# # Annotate and share the tile , report , or visual
1 . Here &apos;s how you annotate :
* The annotation bar in iPhones and iPads *

The air tap is the most basic gesture you need to know to interact with almost every mixed reality app . You tap the thumb and forefinger together with your hand held upright , similar to a mouse click or phone tap .
* * Switch to holographic view * *
Pick up a Power BI artifact , so it will stay in your main field of vision and follow your gaze until you place it somewhere .
This command places a dashboard or report on a wall or object , or hovering in space .
Say &quot; go home &quot; to return to the Power BI classic Windows view .
Use this command to remove an artifact from holographic view .
Use this command to remove all artifacts from holographic view .
# # Scan a report QR code in holographic view
Here are a few limitations and considerations for holographic view .
- You don &apos;t see cross-filtering or highlighting you may have set in Windows classic view .
- Your view of your pinned dashboards and reports is private . We don &apos;t currently support shared experiences .
- The dashboards and reports refresh every 45 seconds , as data changes .

# Teach Q &amp; A to understand questions and terms in Power BI Q &amp; A
# # Start to teach Q &amp; A
3 . Select the red-underlined word .
Q &amp; A offers suggestions and prompts you to provide the correct definition of the term .
Your report consumers won &apos;t see this change until you publish the report back to the service .
# # Define nouns and adjectives
You can teach Q &amp; A two types of terms :
# # # Define a noun synonym
You fill in the box with the term from your data .
If you provide something other than a field from the data model , you may get undesirable results .
# # # Define an adjective filter condition
Sometimes you may want to define terms that act as a condition on the underlying data . An example could be &apos; Awesome Publishers &apos; . &apos; Awesome &apos; could be a condition that only selects publishers that have published X number of products . Q &amp; A tries to detect adjectives , showing a different prompt :
You fill in the box with the condition .
Some example conditions that you can define are :
In these examples , &apos; Products &apos; could be either a column name or a measure .
After you &apos;ve provided definitions , you can go back to see all the fixes you made and edit or delete them .
# # Define roles and rules in Power BI Desktop
To define security roles , follow these steps .
7 . After you &apos;ve created the DAX expression , select the checkmark above the expression box to validate the expression .

title : Tenant admin settings guidance
This article targets Power BI administrators who are responsible for setting up and configuring the Power BI environment in their organization .
We provide guidance for specific tenant settings that help improve the Power BI experience , or could expose your organization to risk . We recommend you always configure your tenant to align with your organization &apos;s policies and processes .
# # Improve Power BI experience
These URLs will become available as links in the Power BI help menu .
# # # Receive email notification service outages or incidents
You can be notified by email if your tenant is impacted by a service outage or incident . This way , you can proactively respond to incidents .
Information protection allows enforcing protection settings — such as encryption or watermarks — when exporting data from the Power BI service .
There are two tenant settings related to information protection . By default , both settings are disabled for the entire organization .
You can restrict users from creating workspaces . This way , you can govern what is created within your organization .
&gt; Currently there &apos;s a transition period between the old workspace experience and the new . This tenant setting applies only to the new experience .
We recommend you assign one or more security groups . These groups can be granted _ or denied _ permission to create workspaces .
Be sure to include instructions in your documentation letting users ( who don &apos;t have workspace creation rights ) know how they can request a new workspace .
Users can share reports and dashboards with people outside your organization .
We recommend you assign one or more security groups . These groups can be granted _ or denied _ permission to share content with external users .
If enabled , we recommend you assign one or more security groups . These groups can be granted _ or denied _ permission to publish reports .
You can restrict users from exporting data from dashboard tiles or report visuals .
We recommend you assign one or more security groups . These groups can be granted _ or denied _ permission to publish reports .
If you need to authorize external users to edit and manage content , we recommend you assign one or more security groups . These groups can be granted _ or denied _ permission to publish reports .
- Embed content in apps ( enabled by default )
- Allow service principals to user Power BI APIs ( disabled by default )
If you have no intention of using the developer APIs to embed content , we recommend you disable them . Or , at least configure specific security groups that would be doing this work .
All visuals start with a class that implements the `IVisual` interface . You can name the class anything as long as there &apos;s exactly one class that implements the `IVisual` interface .
&gt; The visual class name must match what &apos;s defined in the * pbiviz.json * file .
See the sample visual class with the following methods that should be implemented :
* `constructor` , a standard constructor to initialize the visual &apos;s state
* `update` , to update the visual &apos;s data
The constructor of the visual class is called when the visual is instantiated . It can be used for any set up operations needed by the visual .
* `element : HTMLElement` , a reference to the DOM element that will contain your visual
`IVisualHost` contains the following services :
* `createSelectionIdBuilder` , generates and stores metadata for selectable items in your visual
* `allowInteractions : boolean` , a boolean flag which hints whether or not the visual should be interactive
* `persistProperties` , allows users to persist properties and save them along with the visual definition , so they &apos;re available on the next reload
* `authenticationService` , generates a service to help with user authentication
* `instanceId` , returns a string to identify the current visual instance
* `colorPalette` , returns the colorPalette required to apply colors to your data
* `switchFocusModeState` , helps to change the focus mode state
All visuals must implement a public update method that &apos;s called whenever there &apos;s a change in the data or host environment .
* `viewport : IViewport` , dimensions of the viewport that the visual should be rendered within
The destroy function is called when your visual is unloaded and can be used for clean up tasks such as removing event listeners .
&gt; Power BI generally doesn &apos;t call `destroy` since it &apos;s faster to remove the entire IFrame that contains the visual .
# Highlight data points in Power BI Visuals
By default whenever an element is selected the `values` array in the `dataView` object will be filtered to just the selected values . It will cause all other visuals on the page to display just the selected data .
In the example , you &apos;ll notice that 1 bar is selected . And it &apos;s the only value in the highlights array . It &apos;s also important to note that there could be multiple selections and partial highlights . The highlighted values will be presented in the data view .
&gt; Table data view mapping doesn &apos;t support the highlights feature .
# # Highlight data points with categorical data view mapping
The default visual source code after removing unnecessary code will look like this :
Import required interfaces to process data from Power BI :
Create root `div` element for category values :
Clear content of div elements before rendering new data :
Get categories and measure values from `dataView` object :
&gt; Values of `measureHighlights` property can be less that values of `categoryValues` property .
&gt; In means that value was higlighted partially .
Enumerate `categoryValues` array and get corresponding values and highlights :
Create `div` and `p` elements to display and visualize data view values in visual DOM :
Apply required styles for elements to use `flex box` and define colors for div elements :
In the result , you should have the following view of the visual .
# # Highlight data points with matrix data view mapping
The sample data to create hierarchy for matrix data view mapping :
Create the default visual project and apply sample of `capabilities.json` .
Default visual source code after removing unessesray code will look :
Create two `div` elements for visual layout :
Check the data in `update` method , to ensure that visual gets data :
Clear content of `div` elements before render new data :
Create `treeWalker` function to traverse matrix data structure :
Call the function for root elements of column and row of matrix data view structure :
Generate selectionID for nodes and Create buttons to display nodes :
The main step of using highlighting is to process additional array of values .
If you inspect the object of terminal node , you can see that the values array has two properties - value and highlight :
Where `value` property represents value of node without applying a selection from other visual , and highlight property indicates which part of data was highlighted .
&gt; Value of `highlight` property can be less that value of `value` property .
Add the code to process the `values` array of node if it is presented :
As the result you &apos;ll get the visual with buttons and values `highlighted value / default value`

title : Relationship troubleshooting guidance
This article targets you as a data modeler working with Power BI Desktop . It provides you with guidance on how to troubleshoot specific issues you may encounter when developing models and reports .
In this case , here &apos;s a general troubleshooting checklist to follow . You can progressively work through the checklist until you identify the issue ( s ) .
1 . Switch the visual to a table or matrix , or open the &quot; See Data &quot; pane — it &apos;s easier to troubleshoot issues when you can see the query result
1 . If there &apos;s an empty query result , switch to Data view — verify that tables have been loaded with rows of data
1 . Switch to Model view — it &apos;s easy to see the relationships and quickly determine their properties
1 . Verify that relationships exist between the tables
1 . Verify that cardinality properties are correctly configured — they could be incorrect if a &quot; many &quot; -side column presently contains unique values , and has been incorrectly configured as a &quot; one &quot; -side
1 . Verify that the relationships are active ( solid line )
1 . Verify that the filter directions support propagation ( interpret arrow heads )
1 . Verify that the correct columns are related — either select the relationship , or hover the cursor over it , to reveal the related columns
1 . Verify that the related column data types are the same , or at least compatible — it &apos;s possible to relate a text column to a whole number column , but filters won &apos;t find any matches to propagate
1 . Switch to Data view , and verify that matching values can be found in related columns
Here &apos;s a list of issues together with possible solutions .

3 . As you select each manager in the chart , note the following details :
* Andrew &apos;s area of influence spans many different industry segments with widely varying GM % ( most on the positive side ) and Var % .
* Annelie &apos;s chart is similar , except that Annelie only concentrates on a handful of industry segments with a focus on the Federal segment and a focus on the Gladius product .
* Tina works with a handful of segments and has the highest GM % , but the mostly small size of the bubbles shows that Tina &apos;s impact on the company &apos;s bottom line is minimal .
This page has a custom page size format .
# # Dig into the data by asking questions with Q &amp; A

title : Power BI visual data point selections
# Add interactivity into visual by Power BI visuals selections
Power BI provides two ways of interaction between visuals - selection and filtering . The sample below demonstrates how to select any items in one visual and notify other visuals in the report about new selection state .
`Selection` object corresponds to the interface :
# # How to use SelectionManager to select data points
# # # Create an instance of the selection manager
For using the selection manager , you need to create the instance of a selection manager . Usually , visuals create a selection manager instance in the `constructor` of the visual object .
# # # Create an instance of the selection builder
This object has corresponded methods to create `selections` for different types of data view mappings .
&gt; If you need to use selections for table or matrix data view mappings you need to update API version to 2.5.0 or higher .
# # # Create selections for categorical data view mapping
Let &apos;s review how selections represent on categorical data view mapping for sample dataset :
And the visual uses the following data view mapping :
And visual should able to slice data by `Manufacturer` and `Type` too .
Need to fill the visual data baskets .
&gt; The `Values` are required for series because according to data view mapping the visual expects that `Values` will be grouped by `Rows` data .
# # # # Create selections for categories
In `withCategory` method , we pass the column of `category` , in the sample , it &apos;s `Manufacturer` and index of category element .
# # # # Create selections for series
# # # Create selections for table data view mapping
Sample of table data views mapping
To create a selection for each row of table data view mapping , you need to call `withTable` method of selection builder .
The visual code iterates the rows of the table and each row calls `withTable` table method . Parameters of `withTable` method are `table` object and index of the table row .
# # # Create selections for matrix data view mapping
In the sample , `nodeWalker` calls recursively for each node and child nodes .
# # Select datapoints to slice other visuals
In the sample , codes of selections for categorical data view mapping , you saw that we created a click handler for button elements . The handler calls `select` method of the selection manager and passes the selection object .
The interface of `select` method is
The typical scenario of using `multiSelect` handling CTRL button state on click event .

A fiddler capture may be required to investigate further . There could be several reasons for a 403 error .
* The Azure AD auth token expired .
* The authenticated user isn &apos;t a member of the group ( workspace ) .
* The authenticated user isn &apos;t an admin of the group ( workspace ) .
* The authorization header may not be listed correctly . Make sure there are no typos .
The backend of the application may need to refresh the auth token before calling GenerateToken .
# # # Authentication failed with AADSTS90002 : Tenant &apos; authorize &apos; not found
# # # Authentication failed with AADSTS70002 or AADSTS50053
We recommend you enable this policy only as a per-app basis .

You can use DirectQuery to connect directly to dataflows , and thereby connect directly to your dataflow without having to import its data .
Using DirectQuery with dataflows enables the following enhancements to your Power BI and dataflows processes :
Using DirectQuery with dataflows is a preview feature available beginning with the May 2020 version of Power BI Desktop .
There are also prerequisites for using DirectQuery with dataflows :
* Your dataflow must reside within a Power BI Premium enabled workspace
# # Enable DirectQuery for dataflows
Once you &apos;ve applied that setting , refresh the dataflow for the optimization to take effect .
There are a few known limitations with DirectQuery and dataflows , explained in the following list .
* During the preview period of this feature , some customers may experience timeouts or performance issues when using DirectQuery with dataflows . Such issues are being actively addressed during this preview period .
* Composite / mixed models which have import and DirectQuery data sources are currently not supported .
* Large dataflows may have trouble with timeout issues when viewing visualizations . This limitation is expected to be removed as part of this feature &apos;s general availability . Meanwhile , large dataflows that run into trouble with timeout issues should use Import mode .

title : Tips for designing a great Power BI dashboard
Now that you &apos;ve created a dashboard and added some tiles , think about how to make your dashboard not just pretty , but also functional . In general , it means making the most important information stand out and making it clean and uncluttered .
Here are a few tips for dashboards .
What are the key metrics that will help them make decisions ? How will the dashboard be used ? What learned or cultural assumptions may affect design choices ? What information does your audience need to be successful ?
Where is the dashboard going to be displayed ? If it &apos;s on a large monitor , you can put more content on it . But if readers view it on their tablets , a dashboard with fewer tiles is more readable .
# # Tell a story on one screen
Because dashboards are meant to show important information at a glance , having all the tiles on one screen is best . Can you avoid scroll bars on your dashboard ?
Is the dashboard too cluttered ? Remove all but essential information that &apos;s easily read and interpreted .
# # Make use of full screen mode
# # Accent the most important information
If the text and visualizations on your dashboard are all the same size , your readers will have a hard time focusing on what &apos;s most important . For example , card visualizations are a good way to display an important number prominently :
But be sure to provide context .
# # Place the most important information
# # Use the right visualization for the data
* Be careful using visuals that look pretty but are hard to read , such as 3-D charts .
* Be consistent with chart scales on axes , chart dimension ordering , and also the colors used for dimension values within charts .
* Don ’ t mix levels of precision and time . Make sure that time frames are well understood . Don ’ t have one chart that has last month next to filtered charts from a specific month of the year .
* Don ’ t clutter your charts with data labels that aren &apos;t needed . The values in bar charts are usually understood without displaying the actual number .
# # Learn more about dashboard design
To master the art of excellent dashboard design , consider learning basic Gestalt Principles of visual perception and how to clearly communicate actionable information in context . Luckily , there &apos;s a plethora of resources already widely available and sprinkled within our blogs . A few of our favorite books include :

The tutorial takes you through the following steps :
&gt; * Create and publish an Azure Machine Learning model
&gt; * Grant access to a Power BI user to use the model
&gt; * Create a dataflow
&gt; * Apply insights from the Azure ML model to the dataflow
# # Create and publish an Azure ML model
# # Grant a Power BI user access
The following steps assume you are the coadministrator for the Azure subscription and resource group to which the model was published .
# # # Get data for creating the dataflow
Sign in to the Power BI service with the user credentials for whom you granted access to the Azure ML model in the previous step .
To create the entities in your dataflow , sign in to the Power BI service and navigate to a workspace on your dedicated capacity that has the AI preview enabled .
# # # Refresh the dataflow
Select * * Close * * in the upper right corner and wait for the dataflow refresh to complete .
# # Apply insights from your Azure ML model
In our case , since our table matches the original dataset used to train the model , all the parameters have the correct columns already selected .
The resulting * Scored Labels * column has the price prediction from the Azure ML model .
Once you save your dataflow , the Azure ML model will be automatically invoked when the dataflow is refreshed for any new or updated rows in the entity table .
If you no longer need the Azure resources you created using this article , delete them to avoid incurring any charges . You can also delete the dataflows you created , if you no longer require them .

title : Deployment pipelines best practices
# Deployment pipelines best practices ( preview )
This article provides guidance for BI creators who are managing their content throughout its lifecycle . It focuses on leveraging deployment pipelines as a BI content lifecycle management tool .
The article is divided into four sections :
Prepare your content for on-going management throughout its lifecycle . Make sure you review the information in this section , before you do any of the following :
* Release your content to production
* Start using a deployment pipeline for a specific workspace
* Publish your work
# # # Treat each workspace as a complete package of analytics
* * * Modeling and data workspaces * * - These workspaces will contain all the centralized datasets
* * * Reporting workspaces * * - These workspaces will contain all dependent reports and dashboards
# # # Plan your permission model
To implement a secure and easy workflow , plan who gets access to each part of the pipeline . Some of the considerations to take into account are :
* Who should have access to the pipeline ?
* Which operations should users with pipeline access be able to perform in each stage ?
* Who &apos;s reviewing content in the test stage ?
* Should the test stage reviewers have access to the pipeline ?
* Who will oversee deployment to the production stage ?
* Which workspace are you assigning ?
* Which stage are you assigning your workspace to ?
* Do you need to make changes to the permissions of the workspace you &apos;re assigning ?
# # # Connect different stages to different databases
# # # Use parameters in your model
In deployment pipelines , you can configure parameter rules to set specific values for the development , test , and production stages .
Parameters have additional uses , such as making changes to queries , filters , and the text displayed in the report .
This section provides guidance for working with the deployment pipelines development stage .
* It is easier to collaborate with fellow creators on the same .pbix file , if all changes are being done on the same tool .
* Making online changes , downloading the .pbix file , and then uploading it again , creates reports and datasets duplication .
* You can use version control to keep your .pbix files up to date .
# # # Version control for .pbix files
# # # Separate modeling development from report and dashboard development
For enterprise scale deployments , it &apos;s recommended to separate dataset development , and the development of reports and dashboards . To promote changes to only a report or a dataset , use the deployment pipelines selective deploy option .
This section provides guidance for working with the deployment pipelines test stage .
# # # Simulate your production environment
Other than verifying that new reports or dashboards look alright , it &apos;s also important to see how they perform from an end user &apos;s perspective . The deployment pipelines test stage , allows you to simulate a real production environment for testing purposes .
Make sure that these three factors are addressed in your test environment :
* A similar capacity as in production
# # # Use dataset rules with a real-life data source
You can also use this approach if you don &apos;t want to overload your capacity .
&gt; It &apos;s recommended to monitor capacity loads again , after deploying updates to the production stage .
# # # Check related items
Related times can be affected by changes to datasets or reports . During testing , verify that your changes don &apos;t impact or break the performance of existing items , which can be dependent on the updated ones .
# # # Test your app
This section provides guidance to the deployment pipelines production stage .
# # # Manage who can deploy to production
In addition , you should limit access to the pipeline by only enabling pipeline permissions to users that are part of the content creation process .
# # # Set rules to ensure production stage availability
Make sure that you set production dataset rules for data sources and parameters defined in the dataset .
# # # Update the production app
# # # Quick fixes to content
# Get webpage data by providing examples
Prices in graphics are for example purposes only .
# # Using Get Data from Web by example
&gt; Value suggestions only include values less than or equal to 128 characters in length .
From there , you can create visuals or otherwise use the Web page data when creating your Power BI Desktop reports .

# Interact with ArcGIS maps in Power BI
An ArcGIS Maps for Power BI visual can have several different types of layers of demographic location information .
or a canvas with street and transportation detail .
# # # # The single-select tool
Here we &apos;ve selected a brown bubble data point from our base map . Power BI :
- highlights our selection ,
- displays a tooltip for that data point ,
- updates the infographics cards to display data for just our selection , and
- cross-hghlights the column chart .
# # # # The multi-select tool
# # # # The reference layer tool
# # # # The buffer tool
Allows selection of data points using a buffer layer . For example , use this tool to select a drive time radius and continue to interact with the rest of the report . The drive time radius remains active and the infographics cards continue to reflect the drive time radius , but selecting other data points on the map cross-filters the other visuals on the report page .
# # # # The Find Similar tool
* * The ArcGIS map is not showing up * *
* * I &apos;m not seeing all of my information on the map * *

title : Design filters in Power BI reports
# Design filters in Power BI reports
As a report designer , here are some of the tasks you can do in the new Filters pane :
- Add and remove fields to filter on .
- Change the filter state .
- Format and customize the Filters pane so that it feels part of your report .
- Define whether the Filters pane is open or collapsed by default when a consumer opens the report .
- Hide the entire Filters pane or specific filters that you don &apos;t want report consumers to see .
- Control and even bookmark the visibility , open , and collapsed state of the Filters pane .
- Lock filters that you don &apos;t want consumers to edit .
When reading a report , users can hover over any visual to see a read-only list of all the filters or slicers affecting that visual .
# # Turn on new filters in existing reports
# # # Turn on new filters for an existing report in the service
If you haven &apos;t turned on the new look , you can still see the new filter experience by following these steps .
1 . In the Power BI service , open the content list for a workspace .
# # View filters for a visual in Reading mode
# # Build the Filters pane
# # Hide the Filters pane while editing
# # Lock or hide filters
As you turn these settings on and off in the Filters pane , you see the changes reflected in the report . Hidden filters don &apos;t show up in the pop-up filter list for a visual .
You can also configure the Filters pane state to flow with your report bookmarks . The pane &apos;s open , close , and visibility state are all bookmarkable .
# # Format the Filters pane
A big part of the filter experience is that you can format the Filters pane to match the look and feel of your report . You can also format the Filters pane differently for each page in the report . Here are elements you can format :
- Background transparency
- Border on or off
- Title and header font , color , and text size
- Border : on or off
- Font , color , and text size
- Input box color
# # # Format the Filters pane and cards
You see options for formatting the report page , the wallpaper , and also the Filters pane and Filter cards .
You can now modify the default settings of the Filters pane with the theme file . Here &apos;s a sample theme snippet to get you started :
# # Sort the Filters pane
Custom sort functionality is available in the Filters pane . When creating your report , you can drag and drop filters to rearrange them in any order .
# # Improved Filters pane accessibility
# # Filters pane search
The Filters pane search feature allows you to search across your filter cards by title . This feature is helpful if you have several different filter cards in your Filters pane and need help finding the ones of interest .
You can also format the search box , just as you can format the other elements of the Filters pane .
# # Restrict changes to filter type
Under the * * Filtering experience * * section of the report settings , you have an option to control if users can change the filter type .
# # Apply filters button ( preview )
# # # Turn on Apply
You can set this feature at the report level . However , the feature is off by default .
# # # Format the Apply button
Publish-to-web doesn &apos;t display the Filters pane . If you &apos;re planning to publish a report to the web , consider adding slicers for filtering .
Whether you create reports or just view and interact with them , you now know how all those cool visuals are created , and how they connected to the data . Next we get to see those visuals and reports in action .
title : Build permission for shared datasets
# Build permission for shared datasets
Users also need Build permissions to work with the data * outside * Power BI :
- To export the underlying data .
- To access the data via the XMLA endpoint .
# # Ways to give Build permission
You give Build permission for a dataset in a few different ways :
- Members of a workspace with at least a Contributor role automatically have Build permission for datasets in that workspace , and permission to copy a report .
That opens the Permission center for that dataset , where you can set and change permissions .
- Say you have Reshare and Build permission on a dataset . When you share a report or dashboard built on that dataset , you can specify that the recipients also get Build permission for the underlying dataset .
# # Remove Build permission for a dataset
At some point , you may need to remove Build permission for some users of a shared dataset .
They can still see the report built on the shared dataset , but they can no longer edit it .
With this more granular Build permission , you can choose who can only view the content in the existing report or dashboard and who can create content connected to the underlying datasets .
If your dataset is being used by a report outside the dataset workspace , you can &apos;t delete that dataset . Instead , you see an error message .
# Create a paginated report based on a Power BI shared dataset
Here &apos;s a list of what you need and don &apos;t need to use a shared dataset in Power BI Report Builder .
# # Connect to the Power BI dataset
Report Builder fills in the dataset name .
1 . The dataset is listed under Data Sources in the Report Data pane .
Remember , you can connect to multiple Power BI datasets and other data sources in the same paginated report .
# # Get the DAX query for the dataset
When you want the data in your Power BI report and in your Report Builder report to be the same , it &apos;s not enough to connect to the dataset . You also need the query that &apos;s built on that dataset .
# # # Video : Get the DAX query
In the following video , Chris Finlan demonstrates how to get the DAX you need for your paginated report .
# # # Steps to get the DAX query
Now here are the steps to get the query .
1 . Make sure you have a table in your report that contains all the data you want in your paginated report . The table needs to meet these two requirements :
# # Create the dataset with the query
&gt; If your query includes the TOPN function , delete it from your query .
You see the results of the query in the lower box .
Now you see your new dataset with a list of its fields in the Report Data pane .
# # Create a table in the report
One quick way to create a table is to use the Table Wizard .
You see your table in Design View .
This report layout needs some work . It has 54 pages because the columns and margins make the table two pages wide .
You have several formatting options to make your table fit on one page .
1 . Select the report , not the table or title .
1 . You can also make columns narrower . Select the column border and drag the right side to the left .
1 . Another option is to make sure the number values are formatted well . Select a cell with a number value .
&gt; You can format more than cell at a time by holding down the Shift key while you select the other cells .
# # # Getting rid of blank pages
Even if you &apos;ve made the margins and the table columns narrower , you may still end up with every other page being blank . Why ? Because of the math .
When you add up the page margins you set , plus the width of the * body * of the report , it has to be less than the width of the report format .
1 . Select the right edge of the report design surface , and drag it so it &apos;s less than the desired number on the ruler .

# # Step by step for using the Power BI service live connection
Now that we know how useful the Power BI service live connection is , and how you can use it as a best practice approach to report lifecycle management , let &apos;s walk through the steps that get us from Anna &apos;s great report and dataset to a shared dataset that her Power BI teammates can use .
The publishing process begins , and Power BI Desktop shows the progress .
Next , let &apos;s see how other teammates who have access to the workspace where the report and dataset were published can connect to the dataset and build their own reports .
When using the Power BI service live connection , there are a few limitations and considerations to keep in mind .
* Only users with Build permission for a dataset can connect to a published dataset using the Power BI service live connection .
* Members of a workspace can &apos;t replace the originally shared report . Attempts to do so result in a warning that prompts you to rename the file , and publish .
* If you delete the shared dataset in the Power BI service , then other reports based on that dataset will no longer work properly or display their visuals .
title : &apos; Procurement Analysis sample : Take a tour&apos;
The Procurement Analysis sample content pack contains a dashboard , report , and dataset that analyzes a manufacturing company &apos;s spending on vendors by category and location . In the sample , we explore these areas :
* Who the top vendors are
* What categories we spend the most on
* Which vendors give us the highest discount and when
First , let &apos;s look for trends in spending by category and location .
Let &apos;s explore the spending areas in Mexico .
3 . Select the up arrow on the upper-left corner of the chart to drill back up .
4 . Select the drill-down arrow again to turn drill down off .
We can use highlighting to evaluate different cities .
Let &apos;s also explore the discounts available from vendors , and the time periods when we get the most discounts :
* Are the discounts different each month or do they remain the same ?
* Do some cities get more discounts than others ?
Another area to explore is the discount by city . Select each city in turn in the tree map and see how the other charts change :
* St. Louis had a large spike in total invoices in February and a large dip in discount savings in April .
# # # Edit the report
* See how the pages are made .
* Change the visualization type for a chart ; for example , change the tree map to a donut chart .
* Pin charts to your dashboard .

# Printing from the Power BI service
# # Adjust your browser print settings
Here are a few quick tips you can use to format your printout .
2 . To fit more onto a printed page , adjust things like margins and scale .
Experiment with your particular browser &apos;s settings until you get the look that you like . Some browsers even have options to print background graphics .
1 . Open the dashboard that you &apos;d like to print .
# # Print a dashboard tile
4 . Hover over the tile to reveal the Options menu .
&gt; If you &apos;ve followed all of these steps and your tile still isn &apos;t displaying the way you want it to , try the following .
# # Print a report page
Reports can be printed one page at a time .
2 . The Print window for your browser opens .
* Q : I cannot print all the report pages at once .
* A : That is correct . Report pages can only be printed one page at a time .
* Q : I cannot print to PDF .
* A : You will only see this option if you &apos;ve already configured the PDF driver in your browser .
* A : The Print screens vary by browser and software version .
* Q : My printout isn &apos;t scaled correctly . My dashboard doesn &apos;t fit on the page . Other scaling and orientation questions .
* Q : When I &apos;m printing from Full screen mode , I don &apos;t see the print option when I hover over the visual .
* A : Go back to the dashboard or report in default view and re-open the visual in Focus mode and then Full screen mode .
# Connect to Xero with Power BI
The template app dashboard includes tiles and metrics that cover a variety of areas , with corresponding reports to learn more :
&#124; Inventory &#124; Monthly sales amount by product &#124; Inventory &#124;
The dataset also includes the following tables to customize your reports and dashboards :
* Bank Statement Daily Balance
* Invoice Line Items
The following roles are required to access the Xero template app : &quot; Standard + Reports &quot; or &quot; Advisor &quot; .
# Publish an app in Power BI
Your business users often need multiple Power BI dashboards and reports to run their business . With Power BI apps , you can create collections of dashboards and reports and publish these collections as apps to your whole organization or to specific people or groups . For you as a report creator or admin , apps make it easier to manage permissions on these collections .
Business users get your apps in a few different ways :
- They can find and install your app from Microsoft AppSource .
- You can send them a direct link .
- You can install it automatically in your coworkers &apos; Power BI accounts if your Power BI administrator gives you permission .
When the dashboards and reports in your workspace are ready , you choose which dashboards and reports you want to publish , then you publish them as an app .
If you choose not to include a report that has a related dashboard , you see a warning next to the report . You can still publish the app , but the related dashboard won &apos;t have the tiles from that report .
&gt; If your app relies on datasets from other workspaces , it is your responsibility to ensure all app users have access to the underlying datasets .
After you publish your app , you may want to change or update it . It &apos;s easy to update it if you &apos;re an admin or member in the new workspace .
1 . Open the workspace that corresponds to the app .
2 . Make any changes you want to the dashboards or reports .
The workspace is your staging area , so your changes aren &apos;t live in the app until you publish again . This lets you make changes without affecting the published apps .
The people you &apos;ve published the app to automatically see the updated version of the app .
# # Design the navigation experience
You can further customize the app navigation by :
* Reordering the items using the up / down arrows .
* Hiding certain items from the navigation .
# # # Considerations for using the new navigation builder option
Here are general things to keep in mind when using the new navigation builder :
&gt; Your report might have only one visible page because you &apos;ve set up navigation to the rest of the pages with buttons or drillthrough actions .
* The option to not use the app builder is available .
When adding links to your app navigation and selecting the Content area option :
* Ensure the link can be embedded . Some services block the embedding of their content in third-party sites like Power BI .
* Embedding Power BI service content like reports or dashboards in other workspaces isn &apos;t supported .
* A security warning is shown at the top of the embedded content to indicate the content isn &apos;t in Power BI .
# # Automatically install apps for end users
# # # How to push an app automatically to end users
# # # How users get the apps that you push to them
After you push an app , it shows up in their Apps list automatically . In this way , you can curate the apps that specific users or job roles in your organization need to have at their fingertips .
# # # Considerations for automatically installing apps
Here are things to keep in mind when pushing apps to end users :
* Refresh the browser . Before seeing the pushed app in the Apps list , the user may need to refresh , or close and reopen their browser .
* If users don &apos;t immediately see the app in the Apps list , they should refresh or close and reopen their browser .
* Guest users who haven &apos;t accepted an invite don &apos;t get apps automatically installed for them .
# # Allow users to connect to datasets
- Create reports and dashboards based on these datasets .
# # Allow users to copy reports
Any member of a workspace can unpublish the app .
This action uninstalls the app for everyone you &apos;ve published it to , and they no longer have access to it . It doesn &apos;t delete the workspace or its contents .
In full-screen mode , you can show or hide the navigation by selecting the option in the corner .
Things to keep in mind about publishing apps :
* The permissions page doesn &apos;t change permission on datasets in other workspaces . You do see a warning reminding you to grant access to those datasets independently . A best practice is to contact the dataset owner before starting to build your app to ensure it is OK to give all your app users access those datasets .
* For the new workspace experience , if the user added to the app access list already has access to the app through the workspace , they will not be shown in the access list for the app .
* Apps can have a maximum of 200 dashboards .
You may find that occasionally when you create your dashboards , you have more content than what can fit on your canvas . There are a few solutions that help you manage how your dashboard space is displayed , so you can get a full view of your dashboard content .
The easiest method to display your entire dashboard in one screen is selecting the * * Full Screen Mode * * button in the top right-hand corner of the dashboard .
Another way to manage dashboard space is collapsing the nav pane on the left-hand side of the page , by selecting the hamburger icon . To expand the nav pane , click the icon again .
You can ensure that a dashboard will always have a collapsed nav pane by appending the following to the end of the URL :
Users who follow that link will open the dashboard with a collapsed nav pane .
title : &quot; DAX : Column and measure references &quot;
# DAX : Column and measure references
As a data modeler , your DAX expressions will refer to model columns and measures . Columns and measures are always associated with model tables , but these associations are different . So , we have different recommendations on how you &apos;ll reference them in your expressions .
A column is a table-level object , and column names must be unique within a table . So it &apos;s possible that the same column name is used multiple times in your model — providing they belong to different tables . There &apos;s one more rule : a column name cannot have the same name as a measure name or hierarchy name that exists in the same table .
In general , DAX will not force using a _ fully qualified _ reference to a column . A fully qualified reference means that the table name precedes the column name .
The same definition can be rewritten with fully qualified column references .
Our recommendations are simple and easy to remember :
- Always use fully qualified column references
- Never use fully qualified measure references

The updated ribbon is generally available beginning with the May 2020 release of Power BI Desktop . Starting with the March 2020 update , the updated ribbon is on by default .
# # Features of the updated ribbon
These benefits can be grouped into the following categories :
* Create more flexible and intuitive controls in the ribbon , such as the visuals gallery
* Improve accessibility
title : Add multiple fields to a hierarchy slicer
# Add multiple fields to a hierarchy slicer
When you add multiple fields to the slicer , by default it displays an arrow , or * chevron * next to the items that can be expanded to show the items in the next level .
When you select one or more children for an item , you see a semi-selected circle for the top-level item .
The behavior of the slicer hasn &apos;t changed . You can also style your slicer how you want . For example , you can set it to single-select mode . Or you can swap between a list and dropdown .
You can also make the following formatting changes .
# # # Change the title
In this example , the title of the slicer lists the three fields in the hierarchy : Type , Platform , and Name .
Select the text and add a new name .
# # # Change the expand / collapse icon
Hierarchy slicers have some other formatting options . You can change the expand / collapse icon from the default arrow to a plus / minus signs , or a caret .
# # # Change the indentation
# # Prepare for the migration
You need to determine which tenant setup to use .
* Use your existing corporate Power BI tenant ?
* Use a separate tenant for your application ?
* Use a separate tenant for each customer ?
# # Accounts within Azure AD
The following accounts will need to exist within your tenant .
&gt; These accounts will need to have Power BI Pro licenses in order to use workspaces .
1 . A tenant admin user .
It is recommended that this user be a member of all workspaces created for the purpose of embedding .
2 . Accounts for analysts that will create content .
These users should be assigned to workspaces as needed .
&gt; This is just a regular user account in your organization that will be used for the purposes of embedding .
You will need to register an application within Azure AD and grant certain permissions .
# # # Register an application
You should register the application using the application * * master * * account .
# # Create workspaces ( Required )
You can take advantage of workspaces to provide better isolation if your application is servicing multiple customers . Dashboards and reports would be isolated between your customers . You could then use a Power BI account per workspace to further isolate application experiences between your customers .
&gt; You cannot use a personal workspace to take advantage of embedding to non-Power BI users .
&gt; The application * master * account needs to be an admin of the workspace .
Migrating your content from your workspace collections to Power BI Embedded can be done in parallel to your current solution and doesn &apos;t require any downtime .
Content migration relies mainly on two APIs .
There are several types of reports , each requiring a somewhat different migration flow .
# # # # Cached dataset &amp; report
Cached datasets refer to PBIX files that had imported data as opposed to a live connection or DirectQuery connection .
1 . Call Download PBIX API from PaaS workspace .
3 . Call Import PBIX to SaaS workspace .
# # # # DirectQuery dataset &amp; report
2 . Call Download PBIX API from PaaS workspace .
4 . Call Import PBIX to SaaS workspace .
# # # # Old dataset &amp; reports
2 . Call Import PBIX to SaaS workspace .
# # # # Push Dataset &amp; report
1 . Call &quot; Create dataset &quot; API with dataset Json to create dataset in SaaS workspace .
2 . Rebuild report for the created dataset * .
It is possible , using some workarounds , to migrate the push api report from PaaS to SaaS by trying the following .
1 . Uploading some dummy PBIX to PaaS workspace .
2 . Clone the push api report and bind it to the dummy PBIX from step 1 .
3 . Download push API report with the dummy PBIX .
4 . Upload dummy PBIX to your SaaS workspace .
5 . Create push dataset in your SaaS workspace .
6 . Rebind report to push api dataset .
# # Create and upload new reports
3 . Embed your reports from powerbi.com into your application .
# # Map your users to a Power BI user
# # What to do when you are ready for production
When you are ready to move to production , you will need to do the following .
* Edit the workspace and assign it to a Premium capacity under advanced .
* Deploy your updated application to production and begin embedding reports from the Power BI Embedded .
You should do some cleanup within Azure .
* Delete any Workspace Collections that exist within Azure .
# Apply many-many relationships in Power BI Desktop
# # What a relationship with a many-many cardinality solves
# # Use relationships with a many-many cardinality
For example , take a look at the simple model in this image :
Sometimes the tables are joined by two columns , yet neither column is unique . For example , consider these two tables :
* Create a third table that contains only the unique State IDs . The table could be any or all of :
* A table based on a query that &apos;s defined in Query Editor , which could display the unique IDs drawn from one of the tables .
* The combined full set .
# # Use a relationship with a many-many cardinality instead of the workaround
The major differences between * relationships with a many-many cardinality * and the more typical * Many-1 * relationships are as follows :
* You can &apos;t use the `RELATED ( ) ` function , because more than one row could be related .
There are a few limitations for this release of * relationships with a many-many cardinality * and composite models .
When you connect to these multidimensional sources by using DirectQuery , you can &apos;t connect to another DirectQuery source or combine it with imported data .
# Composite model guidance in Power BI Desktop
# # Composite model use cases
Further , you can consider developing a Composite model in the following situations .
- You want to combine two or more DirectQuery data sources into a single model .
# # # Table storage mode
In a Composite model , you can configure the storage mode for each table ( except calculated tables ) :
There are several possible scenarios when Power BI queries a Composite model :
In summary , we recommend that you :
- Consider carefully that a Composite model is the right solution — while it allows model-level integration of different data sources , it also introduces design complexities with possible consequences
- Strive to ensure data integrity across data sources ( including the model cache ) — weak relationships will eliminate rows when related column values don &apos;t match
- Optimize DirectQuery data sources with appropriate indexes for efficient joins , filtering and grouping
# Data sources for the Power BI service
# # What if my data comes from a different source ?
You &apos;ll see the terms dataset and data source used a lot in Power BI . They &apos;re often used synonymously . But they really are two different things , although they &apos;re related .
* An online service like Google Analytics or QuickBooks
* A database in the cloud like Azure SQL Database
* A database or file on a local computer or server in your own organization
title : Data protection metrics report
# # What is the data protection metrics report ?
The report features :
The report refreshes every 24 hours .
# # Viewing the data protection metrics report
&gt; Do not change the report or dataset in any way , since new versions of the report are rolled out from time to time and any changes you &apos;ve made to the original report will be overwritten if you update to the new version .
* If you decide to share information from the data protection metrics report with a user who is not a Power BI administrator , be aware that this report contains sensitive information about your organization .
* The data protection metrics report is a special kind of report and does not show up in &quot; Shared with me &quot; , &quot; Recents &quot; , and &quot; Favorites &quot; lists .
The course was designed specifically for experienced app developers . So , it &apos;s an advantage if you have development experience with :
&gt; - Acquire access using Azure AD apps and tokens
&gt; - Embed Power BI content in your apps
&gt; - Choose the right license to suit your requirements

# # # # Push datasets
# # # Power BI refresh types
# # # # Data refresh
# # # # OneDrive refresh
To review past synchronization cycles , check the OneDrive tab in the refresh history . The following screenshot shows a completed synchronization cycle for a sample dataset .
# # # # Refresh of query caches
Because it happens automatically , you can consider tile refresh an intrinsic part of data refresh . Among other things , you might notice that the refresh duration increases with the number of tiles . The tile refresh overhead can be significant .
# # # # Refresh of report visuals
Regardless of storage modes , no data refresh can succeed unless the underlying data sources are accessible . There are three main data access scenarios :
- A dataset uses data sources that reside on-premises
- A dataset uses data sources in the cloud
- A dataset uses data from both , on-premises and cloud sources
# # # Connecting to on-premises data sources
You have the following options :
- Choose an enterprise data gateway with the required data source definition
- Deploy a personal data gateway
# # # # Using an enterprise data gateway
# # # Accessing cloud data sources
&gt; Each user can only have one set of credentials per data source , across all of the data sets they own , regardless of the workspaces where the datasets reside .
# # # Accessing on-premises and cloud sources in the same source query
There are two options to configure a data gateway to support merging or appending data from on-premises and cloud sources :
- Add a data source definition for the cloud source to the data gateway in addition to the on-premises data sources .
# # # Configuring query parameters
# # Refresh and dynamic data sources
# # # Setting a refresh schedule
# # # Getting refresh failure notifications
# # # Checking refresh status and history
Checking the refresh history of your datasets regularly is one of the most important best practices you can adopt to ensure that your reports and dashboards use current data . If you discover issues , address them promptly and follow up with data source owners and gateway administrators if necessary .
In addition , consider the following recommendations to establish and maintain reliable data refresh processes for your datasets :
- Ensure that Power BI can send refresh failure notifications to your mailbox . Spam filters might block the email messages or move them into a separate folder where you might not notice them immediately .

The `allowInteractions` flag is passed as a Boolean during the initialization of the visual , as a member of the IVisualHost interface .
This industry sample dashboard and underlying report focus on one of the typical supply chain challenges : supplier quality analysis . Two primary metrics are at play in this analysis : total number of defects and the total downtime that these defects caused .
This sample has two main objectives :
* Understand who the best and worst suppliers are , with respect to quality .
* Identify which plants do a better job finding and rejecting defects , to minimize downtime .
# # Downtime caused by defective materials
Let &apos;s analyze the downtime caused by defective materials and see which vendors are responsible .
The Supplier Quality Analysis Sample report opens to the * * Downtime Analysis * * page .
# # # Which are the worst suppliers ?
From this treemap , we can see the top eight vendors are the eight blocks on the left of the treemap . We can also see they account for about 50 % of all downtime minutes .
Now let &apos;s explore which plant does a better job managing defective material , resulting in less downtime .
The report opens to the * * Supplier Quality Analysis * * page .
# # Which material type is best managed ?
The best managed material type is the one with lowest downtime or no impact , regardless of defect quantity .
Let &apos;s verify that this material type doesn &apos;t cause much downtime , despite high defect quantity .
Raw materials appear to be well managed ; although they have more defects , they have lower total downtime minutes .
# # # Compare defects to downtime by year
3 . Do more defects translate into more downtime ? Ask questions in the Q &amp; A box to find out .
There were many more raw materials defects in 2014 than in 2013 .
# # # Compare defects to downtime month to month
Let &apos;s look at another dashboard tile related to total defective quantity .
Let &apos;s see if this increase in defect quantity led to an equal increase in downtime minutes .
Other than a jump in downtime minutes during June and October , the number of defects didn &apos;t result in significantly more downtime . This result shows we &apos;re managing defects well .

Reports that use unsupported connectors or features will not be upgraded to the new format . Reports that have already been upgraded , or that were created subsequent to enabling this new feature , will not support adding the listed unsupported features or connectors .
Queries with errors in upstream steps or branches are not supported .
Datasets using the new metadata format currently don &apos;t show links to dataflows in the lineage view in the Power BI service .
title : Tour the report editor
# Tour the report editor in Power BI
In the Power BI service , the report editor is only available in Editing View . To open a report in Editing view , you must be a report owner or creator , or be a contributor to the workspace that houses the report .
The Power BI report editor is divided into several main sections :
1 . Top nav pane
# # 1 . The top nav pane
# # 2 . The report canvas
For example , when you select an individual visual such as this column chart :
* * The bottom of the Visualization pane * * has three tabs :

title : Use the Power BI Q &amp; A visual
# Introduction to Power BI Q &amp; A visualizations
# # What are Q &amp; A visualizations ?
The Q &amp; A visual allows users to ask natural language questions and get answers in the form of a visual .
The Q &amp; A visual consists of four core components ;
- The question box . This is where users type in their question and are shown suggestions to help them complete their question .
- A pre-populated list of suggested questions .
- Icon to convert the Q &amp; A visual into a standard visual .
- Icon to open Q &amp; A tooling which allows designers to configure the underlying natural language engine .
# # Create a Q &amp; A visual using a suggested question
In this exercise , we &apos;ll select one of the suggested questions to create our Q &amp; A visual .
1 . Start on a blank report page and select the Q &amp; A visual icon from the Visualizations pane .
2 . Drag the border to resize the visual .
# # Create a Q &amp; A visual using a natural language query
6 . Let &apos;s change the visual to a column chart .
7 . Add more visuals to the report page and see how the Q &amp; A visual interacts with the other visuals on the page . In this example , the Q &amp; A visual has cross-filtered the line chart and map and cross-highlighted the bar chart .
# # Format and customize the Q &amp; A visual
The Q &amp; A visual can be customized using the formatting pane , and by applying a theme .
# # # Apply a theme
When you select a theme , that theme is applied to the entire report page . There are many themes to choose from , so try them out until you get the look you desire .
# # # Format the Q &amp; A visual
# # Convert your Q &amp; A visual into a standard visual
We &apos;ve formatted our color blind safe column chart visual a bit -- added a title and a border . Now we &apos;re ready to convert it to a standard visual in our report and also pin it to a dashboard .
# # Advanced features of the Q &amp; A visual
Selecting the cog icon opens the Q &amp; A visual Tooling pane .
The Q &amp; A visual integrates with Office and Bing to attempt to match unrecognized common words with fields in your dataset .
There are a variety of ways you can integrate natural language . For more information , see the following articles :
You can also split each column by category , by dragging a category into the Column Series field in the Visualizations pane . When you do so , each bar is proportionately colored based on the values within each category .
Combination charts are an effective way to visualize multiple measures that have very different scales in a single visualization .

title : Customize X-axis and Y-axis properties
Watch Amanda customize her X- and Y-axes . She &apos;ll also demonstrate the different ways to control concatenation when using drill down and drill up .
&gt; This video uses an older version of Power BI .
Before you can customize your visualization , you have to build it .
2 . At the bottom , select the yellow plus icon to add a new page .
Now you can customize your X-axis . Power BI gives you almost limitless options for formatting your visualization .
# # # Customize the X-axis labels
The X-axis labels display below the columns in the chart . Right now , they &apos;re light grey , small , and difficult to read . Let &apos;s change that .
2 . Expand the X-axis options .
4 . Format the text color , size , and font :
5 . Maybe you don &apos;t like the way the X-axis text is displayed on a diagonal . You have several options .
- Change the text size to something smaller than 14 .
- Make the visualization larger .
Here , we &apos;ve selected the second option and grabbed one of the resize bars to make the visualization wider . It now accommodates the 14-point text without needing to display the text on an angle or with a scrollbar .
# # # Customize the X-axis title
1 . Format the title text color , size , and font :
After you finish the customizations , your stacked column chart looks something like this :
The following example continues our customization of a column chart . Let &apos;s make a few changes to get you familiar with the options , and then you can explore the rest on your own .
# # # Customize the Y-axis labels
The Y-axis labels are displayed to the left by default . Right now , they &apos;re light grey , small , and difficult to read . Let &apos;s change that .
1 . Expand the Y-Axis options .
One reason you might want to turn off the Y-axis , is to save space for more data .
1 . Format the text color , size , and font :
# # # Customize the Y-axis title
# # # Customize the gridlines
Let &apos;s make the gridlines stand out by changing the color and increasing the stroke :
After all these customizations , your column chart should look something like this :
# # Customizing visualizations with dual Y axes
Some visualizations can benefit from having two Y axes . Combo charts are a good example . Before we can format dual Y axes , we &apos;ll create a combo chart that compares trends for sales and gross margin .
# # # Create a chart with two Y-Axes
3 . Reformat the visualization to remove the angled X-axis labels .
# # # Format the second Y-Axis
Because we started with a visualization with one formatted Y-axis , Power BI created the second Y-axis using the same settings . But we can change that .
# # # Add titles to both axes
With a visualization that &apos;s complex , it helps to add axes titles . Titles help your colleagues understand the story your visualization is telling .

# What are Power BI template apps ?
As a Power BI partner , you create a set of out-of-the-box content for your customers and publish it yourself .
You build template apps that allow your customers to connect and instantiate within their own accounts . As domain experts , they can unlock the data in a way that &apos;s easy for their business users to consume .
# # Power BI Apps marketplace
The general process to develop and submit a template app involves several stages . Some stages can include more than one activity at the same time .
Here are the high-level steps .
4 . Import your .pbix file and add content such as a dashboard to your app .
5 . Create a test package to test the template app yourself within your organization .
9 . Now you can start developing the next version in the same workspace , in preproduction .
- Make sure your app includes sample data to get everyone started in a click .
- Carefully examine your application by installing it in your tenant and in a secondary tenant . Make sure customers only see what you want them to see .
- Consider offering more than one template app for separate unique scenarios .
- Enable data customization ; for example , support custom connection and parameters configuration by the installer .

title : On-premises data gateway sizing
The on-premises data gateway supports two workloads . It &apos;s important you first understand these workloads before we discuss gateway sizing and recommendations .
# # # Live Connection and DirectQuery workloads
Reliable , fast , and consistent connectivity is important to ensure report users have responsive experiences .
Determining the correct sizing for your gateway machine can depend on the following variables :
- For Cache data workloads :
- The number of concurrent dataset refreshes
- The volume of data to be retrieved from data sources
- Any transformations required to be done by the Power Query mashup engine
- The volume of data to be transferred to the Power BI service
- For Live Connection and DirectQuery workloads :
- The number of concurrent report users
- The number of visuals on report pages ( each visual sends at least one query )
- The frequency of Power BI dashboard query cache updates
Gateway sizing recommendations depend on many variables . In this section , we provide you with general recommendations that you can take into consideration .
Plan for the best possible connectivity between the Power BI service and your gateway , and your gateway and the data sources .
- Strive for reliability , fast speeds , and low , consistent latencies
- Eliminate — or reduce — machine hops between the gateway and your data sources
- Install one or more gateways in a cluster
- Isolate workloads to standalone gateways , or clusters of gateway servers
# # # Dataset design and settings
Dataset design , and their settings , can impact on gateway workloads . To reduce gateway workload , you can consider the following actions .
For Import datasets :
- Configure less frequent data refresh
For DirectQuery datasets :
- Especially when dynamic RLS is enforced , restrict dashboard cache update frequency
For Live Connection datasets :

# Ways to collaborate and share in Power BI
You &apos;ve created dashboards and reports . Maybe you want to collaborate on them with your coworkers . Or maybe you &apos;re ready to distribute them more widely . What &apos;s the best way to collaborate and share them ? In this article , we compare your options .
* Apps in the Power BI service *
- Collaborate with coworkers in * workspaces * to create meaningful reports and dashboards .
* * Distribute or share dashboards and reports * *
- * Share dashboards or reports * from your My Workspace or another workspace .
- Bundle dashboards and reports in workspaces into * apps * and distribute them to a larger group or your whole organization .
- Print reports .
- Create * dataflows * as a way to share a common data source .
# # Collaborate in a workspace
Now , imagine you have a finished dashboard you need to share with your colleagues . What &apos;s the best way to give them access to the dashboard ? The answer depends on a number of factors .
- If colleagues need to keep the dashboard up to date , or need access to all the content in the workspace , add them to the workspace as Members or Contributors .
- If colleagues just need to view the content in the workspace , add them as Viewers .
- If colleagues just need to see that dashboard and not all the content in the workspace , you can share the dashboard with them directly .
# # Collaborate in Microsoft Teams
You can share with people outside your organization , too . They can view and interact with the dashboard or report too , but can &apos;t share it .
# # Annotate and share from the Power BI mobile apps
# # Distribute insights in an app
After they install the app , they can view it in their browser or mobile device .

# # Create and deploy template apps
# # Configuring the gateway and data source
The following steps describe how to establish a trust relationship between a HANA server and the gateway IdP by signing the gateway IdP &apos;s X509 certificate with a Root CA trusted by the HANA server . You &apos;ll create this Root CA :
Ensure that the Root CA &apos;s private key is secured properly . If it &apos;s obtained by a third party , it could be used to gain unauthorized access to the HANA server .
1 . Create the gateway IdP &apos;s X509 certificate .
1 . Sign the certificate-signing request by using the Root CA you &apos;ve configured your HANA servers to trust .
The resulting IdP certificate is valid for a year ( see the -days option ) .
Import your IdP &apos;s certificate in HANA Studio to create a new SAML Identity Provider :
Now that you have the gateway &apos;s certificate and identity configured , convert the certificate to a pfx format and configure the gateway to use the certificate :
1 . Copy the pfx file to the gateway machine :
1 . Grant the gateway service account access to the private key of the certificate :
Finally , follow these steps to add the certificate thumbprint to the gateway configuration :
1 . Run the following PowerShell command to list the certificates on your machine :
1 . Copy the thumbprint for the certificate you created .
# # Running a Power BI report
1 . On the SAP HANA server , turn on the authentication trace by running the following query :

title : Use what-if parameters to visualize variables
# Create and use what-if parameters to visualize variables in Power BI Desktop
# # Creating a what-if parameter
In addition to creating the parameter , creating a what-if parameter also creates a measure , which you can use to visualize the current value of the what-if parameter .
# # Using a what-if parameter
Let &apos;s create a simple example of using a what-if parameter . We created the what-if parameter in the previous section . Now we &apos;ll put it to use by creating a new measure whose value adjusts with the slider .
The new measure is simply going to be the total sales amount , with the discount rate applied . You can create complex and interesting measures that let the consumers of your reports visualize the variable of your what-if parameter . For example , you could create a report that lets sales people see their compensation if they meet certain sales goals or percentages , or see the effect of increased sales to deeper discounts .
Enter the measure formula into the formula bar , and name the formula * Sales after Discount * .
And , that &apos;s all there is to it . You can use what-if parameters in all sorts of situations . These parameters enable the consumers of reports to interact with different scenarios that you create in your reports .
As long as your model has a date field , Power BI will automatically generate different views for different time hierarchies .
As mentioned before , this course builds your knowledge by following the common flow of work in Power BI :
# Incremental refresh in Power BI
Incremental refresh enables very large datasets in Power BI with the following benefits :
# # # # RangeStart and RangeEnd parameters
# # # # Filter date column updates
# # # # Query folding
# # # Define the refresh policy
Incremental refresh is available on the context menu for tables , except for Live Connection models .
# # # # Incremental refresh dialog
The incremental refresh dialog is displayed . Use the toggle to enable the dialog .
&gt; If the Power Query expression for the table doesn &apos;t refer to the parameters with reserved names , the toggle is disabled .
The header text explains the following :
# # # # Refresh ranges
- Add a new day of data .
- Refresh ten days up to the current date .
The first refresh in the Power BI service may take longer to import all five full calendar years . Subsequent refreshes may be finished in a fraction of the time .
# # # # Current date
&gt; Definition of these ranges might be all you need , in which case you can go straight to the publishing step below . The additional dropdowns are for advanced features .
# # # Advanced policy options
# # # # Detect data changes
&gt; The current design requires that the column to detect data changes is persisted and cached into memory . You may want to consider one of the following techniques to reduce cardinality and memory consumption .
&gt; Persist only the maximum value of this column at time of refresh , perhaps using a Power Query function .
&gt; Reduce the precision to a level that is acceptable given your refresh-frequency requirements .
# # # # Only refresh complete periods
# # Publish to the service
You can now refresh the model . The first refresh may take longer to import the historical data . Subsequent refreshes can be much quicker because they use incremental refresh .
# # XMLA endpoint benefits for incremental refresh
# # # # Override incremental refresh behavior
The following parameters can be inserted into the TMSL refresh command to override the default incremental refresh behavior .
# # # Custom queries for detect data changes

After the client is installed and ODAC is configured properly , we recommend using PowerBI Desktop or other test client to verify correct installation and configuration on the Gateway .
# Use conditional formatting in tables
&gt; Conditional formatting overrides any custom background or font color you apply to the conditionally formatted cell .
The following sections describe each conditional formatting option . You can combine more than one option in a single table column .
# # Format background or font color
# # Color by color scale
# # Color by color values
If you have a field or measure with color name or hex value data , you can use conditional formatting to automatically apply those colors to a column &apos;s background or font color . You can also use custom logic to apply colors to the font or background .
- Color names , such as Green , SkyBlue , or PeachPuff .
The following table has a color name associated with each state :
# # Color based on a calculation
You can create a calculation that outputs different values based on business logic conditions you select . Creating a formula is usually faster than creating multiple rules in the conditional formatting dialog .
You can create many more variations , just by using your imagination and some calculations .
The following example adds icons based on three rules :
# # Format as web URLs
Beginning with the April 2020 release , you can apply conditional formatting rules to totals and subtotals , for both table and matrix visuals .
There are a few considerations to keep in mind when working with conditional table formatting :
- Any table that doesn &apos;t have a grouping is displayed as a single row that doesn &apos;t support conditional formatting .

There are two ways to assign a workspace to a capacity : in the admin portal ; and from a workspace .
# # # Assign from the admin portal
# # # Assign from workspace settings
You can also assign a workspace to a Premium capacity from the settings of that workspace . To move a workspace into a capacity , you must have admin permissions to that workspace , and also capacity assignment permissions to that capacity . Note that workspace admins can always remove a workspace from Premium capacity .
1 . Select the capacity that you want to assign this workspace to .
Once saved , the workspace and all its contents are moved into Premium capacity without any experience interruption for end users .

# Get data from Comma Separated Value ( .CSV ) files
If you have a .CSV , it ’ s time to get it into your Power BI site as a dataset where you can begin exploring your data , create some dashboards , and share your insights with others .
# # Import or connect to a .CSV file
title : Learn about dataflows in Power BI
# Self-service data prep in Power BI
Dataflow refresh scheduling is managed directly from the workspace in which your dataflow was created , just like your datasets .
Here are some examples of how dataflows can work for you :
# # How to use dataflows
# # # Extend the common data model for your business needs
# # # Define dataflows programmatically
You might also want to develop your own programmatic solutions to create dataflows . With public APIs and the capability to programmatically create custom dataflow definition files ( model.json ) , you create a custom solution that fits your organization ’ s unique data and analytics needs .
Public APIs allow developers simple and easy ways to interact with Power BI and dataflows .
# # # Extend your capabilities with Azure
# # Dataflow capabilities on Power BI Premium
* Creating your own custom entities to unify data across your organization
* Getting started with dataflows for developers
# Enable sensitivity labels in Power BI
When sensitivity labels are enabled :
* All members of the organization can see those labels .
* When sensitivity labels are enabled for the entire organization , exceptions are typically security groups .
* When sensitivity labels are enabled only for specific users or security groups , exceptions are typically specific users .
This approach makes it possible to prevent certain users from applying sensitivity labels in Power BI , even if they belong to a group that has permissions to do so .
You need to configure certificates for both the WAP application and the AD FS server . Both of these certificates must be part of a valid certificate authority that your machines recognize .
# # 1 . Configure the report server
To enable a report server to use Kerberos authentication , you need to configure the Authentication Type of the report server to be RSWindowsNegotiate . You configure it in the rsreportserver.config file .
On the AD FS server , using AD FS Management App , complete these steps .
Choose the * * Non claims aware * * option to use Windows Integrated security as the authentication mechanism .
When completed , the properties of the Relying Party Trusts should look like the following .
To transition from Forms authentication to Windows authentication , we need to use constrained delegation with protocol transitioning . This step is part of the Kerberos configuration . We already defined the report server SPN within the report server configuration .
To configure constrained delegation , follow these steps .
1 . This option sets up constrained delegation for this WAP Server machine account . We then need to specify the services that this machine is allowed to delegate to .
# # # Add WAP Application
8 . Run the following PowerShell command to validate the WAP configuration .
# # Connect to the report server through the browser

# Use DirectQuery in Power BI Desktop
There are a few benefits to using DirectQuery :
- DirectQuery lets you build visualizations over very large datasets , where it would otherwise be unfeasible to first import all the data with pre-aggregation .
- The 1-GB dataset limitation * doesn &apos;t * apply to DirectQuery .
There are currently a few limitations to using DirectQuery :
- Limitations are placed on DAX expressions allowed in measures to ensure that queries sent to the underlying data source have acceptable performance .
# # Important considerations when using DirectQuery
The following three points should be taken into consideration when using DirectQuery :
# # Publish to the Power BI service
Reports created using DirectQuery can be published to the Power BI service .
4 . Add the credentials . Otherwise , an error occurs when you open a published report or explore a dataset that &apos;s created with a DirectQuery connection .

To change the chart aggregation , follow these steps :
# # Create and use your own measures
Create a quick measure using one of these methods :
# # # Create a measure
To create a measure , follow these steps :
The formula bar appears along the top of the report canvas , where you can rename your measure and enter a DAX formula .
An opening parenthesis appears , along with a drop-down suggestion list of the available columns you can pass to the SUM function .
The column name preceded by the table name is called the fully qualified name of the column . Fully qualified column names make your formulas easier to read .
&gt; Syntax errors are most often caused by a missing or misplaced closing parenthesis .
1 . Subtract the other two columns inside the formula :
The down arrow turns into an up arrow and a large box appears .
# # # Use your measure in the report
Add a slicer to further filter net sales and sales amounts by calendar year :
This action creates a blank table visualization on the report canvas .
# # # Use your measure in another measure
The resulting formula should appear as :
The chart shows the net sales amount per unit over all products sold . This chart isn &apos;t very informative ; we &apos;ll address it in the next step .
Ok , now we &apos;re just playing , but you have to admit that &apos;s cool ! Experiment with other ways to filter and format the visualization .
# Publish datasets and reports from Power BI Desktop
When publishing is complete , you receive a link to your report . Select the link to open the report in your Power BI site .
This process is straightforward , but there are a few things you should know :
* If you rename or delete a column or measure , any visualizations you already have in Power BI with that field could be broken .
# Using OAuth to connect to Power BI Report Server and SSRS
The public URL will be that the Power BI mobile app will connect to . For example , it may look similar to the following .
You need to configure certificates for both the WAP application and the ADFS server . Both of these certificates must be part of a valid certificate authority that your mobile devices recognize .
To enable a report server to use Kerberos authentication , you need to configure the Authentication Type of the report server to be RSWindowsNegotiate . You do it in the rsreportserver.config file .
# # # Create an application group
You can create the application group with the following steps .
* * Android Apps only need the following steps : * *
&gt; This URL is case sensitive !
When completed , you should see the properties of your application group look similar to the following .
To configure constrained delegation , you want to do the following steps .
2 . Find the machine account for your WAP server . By default , it will be in the computers container .
This sets up constrained delegation for this WAP Server machine account . We then need to specify the services that this machine is allowed to delegate to .
&gt; You may only see the NetBIOS SPN . It will actually select both the NetBIOS and FQDN SPNs if they both exist .
# # # Setting Integrated Authentication for the WAP Application
After you add the WAP Application , you need to set the BackendServerAuthenticationMode to use IntegratedWindowsAuthentication . You need the ID from the WAP Application in order to set it .
Run the following command to set the BackendServerAuthenticationMode using the ID of the WAP Application .
# # Connecting with the Power BI Mobile App
# # # You receive the error &quot; Failed to login to SSRS server &quot;
If the sign-in works successfully when using Fiddler , you may have a certificate issue with either the WAP application or the ADFS server .
# Using computed entities on Power BI Premium
There are two ways you can connect dataflow data to Power BI :
* Using an external dataflow
The following sections describe how to create computed entities on your dataflow data .
# # How to create computed entities
Once you have a dataflow with a list of entities , you can perform calculations on those entities .
# # # Example use cases
First you would need to aggregate the data from the ServiceCalls to calculate the number of support calls that were done for each account in the last year .
And then you can see the results , shown as * EnrichedAccount * in the following image .
And that &apos;s it - the transformation is performed on the data in the dataflow that resides in your Power BI Premium subscription , not on the source data .
It &apos;s important to note that if you remove the workspace from Power BI Premium capacity , the associated dataflow will no longer refresh .

# Add colors to your Power BI visuals
This article describes how to add colors to your visuals and how to handle data points for a color visual .
`IVisualHost` exposes color as one of its services .
# # Add color to data points
A different color represents each data point .
Add the color to the `BarChartDataPoint` interface , as in the following example :
# # Use the color palette service
The `colorPalette` service manages the colors used in your visual .
An instance of the service is available on `IVisualHost` .
Define it in the `update` method .
# # Assigning color to data points
Next , specify `dataPoints` .
In this example , each of the `dataPoints` includes value , category , and color .
`dataPoints` can also include other properties .
In `SampleBarChart` , the `visualTransform` method encapsulates the `dataPoints` calculation .
That method is a part of the Bar Chart viewmodel .
Because the method iterates through the `dataPoints` calculation in `visualTransform` , it &apos;s the ideal place to assign colors , as in the following code :
title : One-to-one relationship guidance
There are two scenarios that involve one-to-one relationships :
It &apos;s unusual , however , that you &apos;d relate two fact-type tables with a one-to-one relationship . It &apos;s because both fact-type tables would need to have the same dimensionality and granularity . Also , each fact-type table would need unique columns to allow the model relationship to be created .
When columns from a fact-type table are used for filtering or grouping , you can consider making them available in a separate table . This way , you separate columns used for filter or grouping , from those columns used to summarize fact rows . This separation can :
- Reduce storage space
- Simplify model calculations
- Contribute to improved query performance
- Deliver a more intuitive * * Fields * * pane experience to your report authors
Consider a source sales table that stores sales order details in two columns .
# # Row data spans across tables
To help describe how the relationship filter propagation works , the model diagram has been modified to reveal the table rows . All examples in this article are based on this data .
When possible , we recommend you avoid creating one-to-one model relationships when row data spans across model tables . It &apos;s because this design can :
- Make it difficult for report authors to find related fields , because they &apos;re distributed across multiple tables
- Limit the ability to create hierarchies , as their levels must be based on columns from the _ same table _
- Produce unexpected results when there isn &apos;t a complete match of rows between the tables
# # # Intra-island one-to-one relationship
The following steps present a methodology to consolidate and model the one-to-one related data :
# # # Inter-island one-to-one relationship
Let &apos;s see what happens when fields from both tables are added to a table visual , and a weak relationship exists between the tables .
title : Share a dataset
# # Steps to sharing your dataset
A best practice is to save the .pbix file to a Microsoft 365 group .
Already , other members of this workspace can create reports in other workspaces based on this dataset . Use the Manage Permissions option on the dataset in the workspace content list give additional users access to the dataset .
# # Track your dataset usage
When you have a shared dataset in your workspace , you may need to know what reports in other workspaces are based on it .
Things to keep in mind about sharing datasets :
# Connect to data by using Power BI Desktop generic interfaces
# # Power BI Desktop data interfaces
In the following sections , you can find lists of data sources that can be accessed by these generic interfaces .
# # Data sources accessible through ODBC

# # Data sources accessible through R Script
# High-density line sampling in Power BI
# # How high-density line sampling works
# # How the new line sampling algorithm works
The new algorithm for high-density line sampling is available for line chart and area chart visuals with a continuous x-axis .
# # # Minimum and maximum values for high-density line visuals
For any given visualization , the following visual limitations apply :
The maximum number of data limits is higher for the following visual types , which are * exceptions * to the 3,500 data point limit :
# # # Evaluating representative data points for high-density line visuals
If that sounds like a lot of analysis to ensure the occasional outlier is captured and properly displayed in the visual , you are correct , but that &apos;s the exact reason for the new algorithm and binning process .
# # Tooltips and high-density line sampling
This situation will happen frequently with tooltips . The high and low values for a given bin might not match perfectly with the evenly scaled x-axis value points , and as such the tooltip will not display the value .
# # How to turn on high-density line sampling
* When the size of an overall data source is too big , the new algorithm eliminates series ( legend elements ) to accommodate the data import maximum constraint .
* In this situation , the new algorithm orders legend series alphabetically , starts down the list of legend elements in alphabetical order until the data import maximum is reached , and does not import additional series .

The troubleshooting guides , associated with each scenario , provide detailed explanations about what the metrics mean , so you can better understand the state of the capacity , and what can be done to mitigate any issues .
Those two scenarios are described in the following sections .
# # # Scenario one - current load is too high
The alarm threshold , which is the red dotted line , marks incidents of 90 % memory consumption .
The warning threshold , which is the yellow dotted line , marks incidents of 70 % memory consumption .
The black dotted line indicates the memory usage trendline , based on the current capacity &apos;s memory usage over the course of the graph timeline .
# # # # Diagnosing scenario one
Consistent high active memory utilization may result in forcing datasets that are actively being used to be evicted , or can prevent new datasets from able to load . The following steps can help you diagnose problems
You can take the following steps to remedy the problems associated with scenario one :
# # # Scenario two - future load will exceed limits
# # # # Diagnosing scenario two
To diagnose scenario two , determine if the trend line is showing an upward trend towards warning or alarm thresholds .

When the number of queries to execute exceeds the limits of the capacity , queries are placed in a queue until resources are available to execute them . If the size of the queue grows too large , queries in that queue can end up waiting more than 100 milliseconds .
# # The refresh waits metric
This gauge shows that in the last seven days from the last refresh report refresh , 3.18 % of the refreshes waited more than 10 minutes .
# # # Scenario one - not enough memory
In scenario one , there isn &apos;t enough available memory to load the dataset . There are two situations that result in a refresh being throttled during low memory conditions :
1 . Not enough memory to load the dataset .
2 . The refresh was canceled due to a higher priority operation .
The priority for loading datasets is the following :
1 . Interactive query
2 . On-demand refresh
3 . Scheduled refresh
If there isn &apos;t enough memory to load a dataset for an interactive query , scheduled refreshes are stopped and their datasets unloaded until sufficient memory become available . If that doesn &apos;t free up enough memory , then on-demand refreshes are stopped and their datasets are unloaded .
To diagnose scenario one , first determine whether throttling is due to insufficient memory . The steps to do so are the following .
# # # Scenario two - not enough CPU for refresh
In scenario two , there isn &apos;t enough available CPU to carry out the refresh .
- Using Power BI paginated report Analysis Services query designers .
- Connecting to the model using non-Power BI report designers .

# Datasets in the Power BI service
This article provides a technical explanation of Power BI datasets .
- Connecting to an existing data model that isn &apos;t hosted in a Power BI capacity
- Uploading a Power BI Desktop file that contains a model
# # # Power BI Desktop-developed models
Distinctions , then , can be made about Power BI datasets that represent models :
Here is a summary of important facts about Power BI datasets that represent models :
- Power BI-hosted models that import data :
- Must be fully loaded into memory so that they can be queried .
- Models may enforce RLS rules , enforcing filters to limit data access to certain users .
It &apos;s also important to understand that Power BI-hosted Import models can refresh according to a schedule , or be triggered on-demand by a user in the Power BI service .

The axis helper ( `axis` object in utils ) provides functions to simplify manipulations with axis .
This function returns recommended number of ticks according to width of chart .
This function returns recommended number of ticks according to height of chart .
Gets the optimal number of ticks based on minimum value , maximum value , and measure metadata and max tick count ;
This function returns the margins for tick labels .
Checks if value is of DateTime type .
Uses the D3 scale to get the actual category thickness .
This function finds and returns the closest x-axis index .
This function computes and returns a diff of values in the scale .
This function creates a domain of values for axis .
This function gets the `ValueType` of a category column . Default is `Text` if the type isn &apos;t present .
This function sets customized domain , but don &apos;t change when nothing is set .
This function combines the forced domain with the actual domain if one of the values was set .
The forcedDomain is in first priority . Extends the domain if any reference point requires it .
This function indicates whether the number is power of 10 .
The `DataLabelManager` helps to create and maintain labels . It arranges label elements using the anchor point or rectangle . Collisions can be automatically detected to reposition or hide elements .
The `DataLabelManager` class provides the following methods :
This method arranges the labels position and visibility on the canvas according to labels sizes and overlapping .
This static method checks if provided rectangle is valid ( has positive width and height ) .
The `DataLabelUtils` provides utils to manipulate data labels .
This function calculates precision from given format .
This function returns format precision from given format .
This function returns VisualObjectInstance for data labels .
This function adds VisualObjectInstance for Category data labels to enumeration object .

# View Power BI reports optimized for your phone
All the other features of Power BI reports still work in phone-optimized reports . Read more about what you can do in :
# # Filter the report page on a phone
2 . Use basic or advanced filtering to see the results you &apos;re interested in .
In phone reports when you select a visual , the phone report highlights that visual and focuses on it , neutralizing canvas gestures .
With the visual selected , you can do things like scroll within the visual . To de-select a visual , just touch anywhere outside the visual area .
# # Open visuals in focus mode
Phone reports also offer a focus mode : You get a bigger view of a single visual and explore it more easily .
What you do in focus mode carries over to the report canvas and vice versa . For example , if you highlight a value in a visual , then return to the whole report , the report is filtered to the value you highlighted in the visual .
Some actions are only possible in focus mode , due to screen size constraints :
Revert is available at the report level , clearing exploration from all visuals , or at the visual level , clearing exploration from the selected visual .
# # Drill down in a visual
There are few types of drill-down :
2 . Tooltip will show up , and if hierarchy is defined , then the tooltip footer will show drill down and up arrow .
3 . Tap on the down arrow for drill-down
4 . Tap on the up arrow for drill-up .
# # # Drill to next level
In this example , the bars show the values for states .
Now the bars show the values for cities .
4 . If you tap the arrow in the upper-left corner , you return to the phone report with the values still expanded to the lower level .
# # Drill through from a value
Drill through connects values in one report page , with other report pages . When you drill through from a data point to another report page , the data point values are used to filter the drilled through page , or it will be in the context of the selected data .
2 . Tooltip will show up , and if drill through is defined , then the tooltip footer will show drill through arrow .
3 . Tap on the arrow for drill through
4 . Choose which report page to drill through
5 . Use the back button , at the app header to go back to the page you started from .

# Multi-Geo support for Power BI Embedded
Notice that when opening the location drop-down menu , your home tenant is the default selection .
When choosing a different location , a message prompts you to make sure you &apos;re aware of the selection .
You can see your capacities location easily when going to the main Power BI Embedded management page in the Azure portal .
You can &apos;t change a Power BI Embedded resource location once you &apos;ve created a new capacity .
To move your Power BI content to a different region , follow these steps :
2 . Assign all workspaces from the existing capacity to the new capacity .
3 . Delete or pause the old capacity .
It &apos;s important to note that if you decide to delete a capacity without reassigning its content , all the content in that capacity moves to a shared capacity , which is in your home region .
# # API support for Multi-Geo
To support management of capacities with Multi-Geo through API , we have made some changes to existing APIs :
* Confirm that any movement you initiate between regions follows all corporate and government compliance requirements before initiating data transfer .
* Multi-Geo doesn &apos;t result in better performance in general . Loading reports and dashboards still involve requests to the home region for metadata .

# Create and use filled maps ( choropleth maps ) in Power BI
# # What is sent to Bing
# # When to use a filled map
Filled maps are a great choice :
* to display quantitative information on a map .
* to show spatial patterns and relationships .
* when your data is standardized .
* when working with socioeconomic data .
* when defined regions are important .
* to get an overview of the distribution across the geographic locations .
# # # Create a filled map
3 . Filter the map to display only the continental United States .
Power BI gives you plenty of control over the appearance of your filled map . Play around with these data color controls until you get the look you want .
Highlighting a location in a filled map cross-filters the other visualizations on the report page ... and vice versa .
2 . Copy the filled map using CTRL-C .
title : Objects and properties of Power BI visuals
# Objects and properties of Power BI visuals
Objects describe customizable properties that are associated with a visual . An object can have multiple properties , and each property has an associated type that describes what the property will be . This article provides information about objects and property types .
`myCustomObject` is the internal name that &apos;s used to reference the object within `dataView` and `enumerateObjectInstances` .
`displayName` is the name that will be shown in the property pane .
`properties` is a map of properties that are defined by the developer .
&gt; `show` is a special property that enables a switch to toggle the object .
There are two property types : `ValueTypeDescriptor` and `StructuralTypeDescriptor` .
# # # # Value type descriptor
`ValueTypeDescriptor` types are mostly primitive and are ordinarily used as a static object .
Here are some of the common `ValueTypeDescriptor` elements :
# # # # Structural type descriptor
`StructuralTypeDescriptor` types are mostly used for data-bound objects .
The most common `StructuralTypeDescriptor` type is * fill * .
An example is shown in the following code :
To use objects effectively , you need a function in your custom visual called `enumerateObjectInstances` . This function populates the property pane with objects and also determines where your objects should be bound within the dataView .
Here is what a typical setup looks like :
The properties in `enumerateObjectInstances` reflect the properties that you defined in your capabilities . For an example , go to the end of this article .
The selector in `enumerateObjectInstances` determines where each object is bound in the dataView . There are four distinct options .
This object is bound to columns with the matching `QueryName` .
# # # # Scope identity
# # # # # Example
title : Manage your data source - Import / scheduled refresh
# Manage your data source - Import / scheduled refresh
Then fill in the information for the data source , which includes the source information and credentials that are used to access the data source .

# Tutorial : Create an R-powered Power BI visual
This tutorial describes how to create an R-powered visual for Power BI .
&gt; * Create an R-powered visual
&gt; * Add libraries to the visual
&gt; * Add a static property
&#124; MonthNo &#124; Total Units &#124;
This command creates a new folder structure based on the `rvisual` template . This template includes a basic , ready-to-run R-powered visual that runs the following R script :
The `Values` data frame will contain columns in `Values` data role .
# # Editing the R Script
1 . When your R script is ready , copy it to the `script.r` file in your visual project created at one of the previous steps .
# # Add libraries to visual package
This procedure allows your visual to use the `corrplot` package .
1 . Add the library dependency for your visual to `dependencies.json`. Here is an example of the file content :
1 . After you make these changes , start using the package in your `script.r` file .
The result of using `corrplot` package looks like this example :
# # Adding a static property to the property pane
Enable users to change UI settings . To do this , add properties to the property pane that change the user-input based behavior of the R script .
After these steps , you can change the property of the visual .
Finally , the R script must start with a property . If the user doesn &apos;t change the property , the visual doesn &apos;t get any value for this property .
1 . Change the R script in your visual to match the following code :
Your final visual looks like the following example :

The following articles provide more information about formulas and DAX in Power BI Desktop .
The * combine files * transform behaves as follows :
* The transform allows you to select a specific object from the first file , such as an Excel workbook , to extract .
* The combine files transform then automatically takes these actions :
* Creates an example query that performs all the required extraction steps in a single file .
With the behavior of combine files , you can easily combine all files within a given folder if they have the same file type and structure ( such as the same columns ) .
In addition , you can easily apply additional transformation or extraction steps by modifying the automatically created exemplar query , without having to worry about modifying or creating additional function query steps . Any changes to the exemplar query are automatically generated in the linked function query .

# Configure Kerberos-based SSO from Power BI service to on-premises data sources
# # # Install and configure the Microsoft on-premises data gateway
The on-premises data gateway supports an in-place upgrade , and _ settings takeover _ of existing gateways .
# # # Run the gateway Windows service as a domain account
# # Obtain domain admin rights to configure SPNs ( SetSPN ) and Kerberos constrained delegation settings
To configure SPNs and Kerberos delegation settings , a domain administrator should avoid granting rights to someone that doesn &apos;t have domain admin rights . In the following section , we cover the recommended configuration steps in more detail .
# # Configure Kerberos constrained delegation for the gateway and data source
If necessary , configure an SPN for the gateway service domain account as a domain administrator and configure delegation settings on the gateway service domain account .
# # # Configure an SPN for the gateway service account
First , determine whether an SPN was already created for the domain account used as the gateway service account :
# # # Add gateway service account to Windows Authorization and Access Group if required
To complete this configuration step , for each domain that contains Active Directory users you want the gateway service account to be able to impersonate :
1 . Sign in to a computer in the domain , and launch the Active Directory Users and Computers MMC snap-in .
8 . Restart the gateway service .
# # # Decide on the type of Kerberos constrained delegation to use
Depending on which approach you want to use , proceed to one of the following sections . Don &apos;t complete both sections :
# # Configure the gateway service account for standard Kerberos constrained delegation
Here &apos;s how to configure the delegation settings :
8 . Select the SPN that you created for the database server .
You should now see the SPN in the list of services to which the gateway service account can present delegated credentials .
# # Configure the gateway service account for resource-based Kerberos constrained delegation
Complete the following configuration steps :
# # Grant the gateway service account local policy rights on the gateway machine
# # # Set user-mapping configuration parameters on the gateway machine ( if necessary )
You can set the `msDS-cloudExtensionAttribute1` property with the Active Directory Users and Computers MMC snap-in :
# # Complete data source-specific configuration steps
# # Run a Power BI report
When you publish , select the gateway you &apos;ve configured for SSO if you have multiple gateways .

# DAX : Use variables to improve your formulas
As a data modeler , writing and debugging some DAX calculations can be challenging . It &apos;s common that complex calculation requirements often involve writing compound or complex expressions . Compound expressions can involve the use of many nested functions , and possibly the reuse of expression logic .
Using variables in your DAX formulas helps you write complex and efficient calculations . Variables can :
Let &apos;s start with the following measure definition .
The measure produces the correct result , yet let &apos;s now see how it can be improved .
The measure continues to produce the correct result , and does so in about half the query time .
In the previous measure definition , notice how the choice of variable name makes the RETURN expression simpler to understand . The expression is short and self-describing .
Variables can also help you debug a formula . To test an expression assigned to a variable , you temporarily rewrite the RETURN expression to output the variable .
title : The supportsKeyboardFocus feature
This article describes how to use the `supportsKeyboardFocus` feature in Power BI visuals .
The `supportsKeyboardFocus` feature allows navigating the data points of the visual using the keyboard only .
This feature requires API v2.1.0 or higher .
This feature can be applied to all visuals except image visuals .
To use the `supportsKeyboardFocus` feature , add the following code to the * capabilities.json * file of your visual .
This capability allows the visual to receive focus through keyboard navigation .
Report parameters are case-sensitive and use these special characters :
- A semicolon in any portion of the string is replaced with the characters ` % 3A` .
Browsers should automatically perform the proper URL encoding . You don &apos;t have to encode any of the characters manually .
To set a report parameter within a URL , use the following syntax :

title : Troubleshooting Power BI gateway ( personal mode )
# Troubleshooting Power BI gateway ( personal mode )
The following sections go through some common issues you might come across when you use the Power BI on-premises data gateway ( personal mode ) .
# # Update to the latest version
The current version of the gateway for personal use is the on-premises data gateway ( personal mode ) . Update your installation to use that version .
Many issues can surface when the gateway version is out of date . It &apos;s a good general practice to make sure you &apos;re on the latest version . If you haven &apos;t updated the gateway for a month or longer , consider installing the latest version of the gateway . Then see if you can reproduce the issue .
&gt; If you have a 32-bit version of Excel , you can &apos;t install a 64-bit version ACE provider on the same computer .
You might still be on an older version of the gateway ( personal mode ) .
title : Capabilities and properties of Power BI visuals
# Capabilities and properties of Power BI visuals
You use capabilities to provide information to the host about your visual . All properties on the capabilities model are `optional` .
The root objects of a visual &apos;s capabilities are `dataRoles` , `dataViewMappings` , and so on .
# # Define the data fields that your visual expects : dataRoles
* `Grouping` : Discrete values that are used to group measure fields .
* `GroupingOrMeasure` : Values that can be used as either a grouping or a measure .
# # # Valid data types in requiredTypes and preferredTypes
The preceding data roles would create the fields that are displayed in the following image :
# # Define how you want the data mapped : dataViewMappings
A DataViewMappings property describes how the data roles relate to each other and allows you to specify conditional requirements for the them .
Most visuals provide a single mapping , but you can provide multiple dataViewMappings . Each valid mapping produces a data view .
# # Define property pane options : objects
Objects describe customizable properties that are associated with the visual . Each object can have multiple properties , and each property has a type that &apos;s associated with it . Types refer to what the property will be .
# # Handle partial highlighting : supportsHighlight
# # Handle advanced edit mode : advancedEditModeSupport

The visualization is getting more interesting , but you can &apos;t see much of the post text in the chart . To show more of the post text :
1 . Use the handles on the chart visualization to resize the chart to be as large as possible .
The chart now shows more of the post content .
The x axis ( number of comments ) of the chart doesn &apos;t show exact values , and looks lost at the bottom of the chart . Let &apos;s use data labels instead :
Now the chart shows the exact number of comments for each post .
# # # Edit the data type
After the changes load , the data labels on the chart become whole numbers .
# # # Create a date slicer
Suppose you want to visualize the number of comments on posts over time . You can create a slicer visualization to filter the chart data to different time frames .
A blank slicer visualization appears .
# # # Format the visualizations
Give the chart a more descriptive and attractive title :
5 . Experiment with other formatting options and settings to change the appearance of your visualizations .

Recreating all of your work would be difficult , but with Power BI Desktop you can just duplicate a report page .
You can then rename the new page tab as appropriate , update the text title if you have one , and then update your visuals with the new field you want to track .
# Develop with the REST APIs for Power BI Report Server
# # Components of a REST API request / response
A REST API request / response pair can be separated into five components :
* URI host : Specifies the domain name or IP address of the server where the REST service endpoint is hosted , such as `myserver.contoso.com` .
* HTTP request message header fields :
* Optional additional header fields , as required by the specified URI and HTTP method .
* Optional additional header fields , as required to support the request &apos;s response , such as a `Content-type` response header .
# Work with Model view in Power BI Desktop
# # Numeric control over summarization
Let &apos;s take an example , and demonstrate how to control the way Power BI summarizes numeric data fields .
You can select the type of currency symbol used , by selecting the currency symbol drop down , which is shown in the following image .
There are many different options for formatting fields . For example , you can change the format from currency to percentage .
# # Manage and clarify your location data
Your dashboards , including any new ones , appear in the Dashboards section on the left side of the Power BI service . Select a dashboard from the list to view it .
These other articles explain how to make specific types of slicers :
# # When to use a slicer
Slicers are a great choice when you want to :
* Display commonly used or important filters on the report canvas for easier access .
* Make it easier to see the current filtered state without having to open a drop-down list .
* Filter by columns that are unneeded and hidden in the data tables .
* Create more focused reports by putting slicers next to important visuals .
Power BI slicers don &apos;t support :
The new slicer is now populated with a list of district manager names and their selection boxes .
# # Control which page visuals are affected by slicers
By default , slicers on report pages affect all the other visualizations on that page , including each other . As you choose values in the list and date sliders you just created , notice the effects on the other visualizations . The filtered data is an intersection of the values selected in both slicers .
# # Sync and use slicers on other pages
You can sync a slicer and use it on any or all pages in a report .
This selection causes the * * District Monthly Sales * * slicer to sync across these three pages .
&gt; Although the slicer initially appears on the synced pages at the same size and position as on the original page , you can move , resize , and format synced slicers on the various pages independently .
1 . Select the drop-down arrows next to each category to display and edit the options .
This setting changes the color and thickness of the header and item outlines and underlines .
&gt; Responsive layout changes can override specific heading and item formatting that you set .
Experiment with different item sizes and arrangements , and note how the responsive formatting changes accordingly . These options are available only when you select horizontal orientations .
# # # Selection controls options ( list slicers only )
- For this article , format the title text as follows :
Items options are only available for list slicers .
# # # Date / numeric inputs and slider options
Date / numeric inputs and slider options are only available for range slider slicers .

title : Optimize reports for the Power BI mobile apps
# Optimize Power BI reports for the mobile app
Power BI provides a number of features to help you create mobile-optimized versions of your reports :
* A mobile layout view where you can create your mobile-optimized report by dragging and dropping visuals onto a phone emulator canvas .
* Visuals and slicers that can be optimized for use on small , mobile screens .
These capabilities make it possible to design and build attractive , interactive mobile-optimized reports .
# # Create a mobile-optimized portrait version of a report page
The first step is to design and create the report in the regular web view . After you &apos;ve created the report , you can optimize it for phones and tablets .
To create the mobile-optimized view , open the mobile layout view :
* Each visual also has a visibility indicator . The visibility indicator of a visual changes depending on the visibility status of the visual in the current state of the web report view . The visibility indicator is useful when working with bookmarks .
# # Add visuals to the mobile layout canvas
You can add some or all of the web report page visuals to the mobile-optimized report page . You can add each visual only once , and you don &apos;t have to include all the visuals .
&gt; You can drag and drop hidden visuals onto the canvas . They will be placed , but not shown unless their visibility status changes in the current web report view .
Visuals can be layered one on top of the other to create interactive reports using bookmarks , or to build attractive reports by layering visuals over images .
The phone report grid scales across phones of different sizes , so your report looks good on small- and large-screen phones .
# # Remove visuals from the mobile layout canvas
You can remove all the visualizations from the canvas by clicking the eraser on the * * Visualization * * pane .
Removing visuals from the mobile layout canvas removes them from the canvas only . The visuals still appear in the visualization pane , and the original report remains unaffected .
# # Configure visuals and slicers for use in mobile-optimized reports
Slicers offer on-canvas filtering of report data . When designing slicers in the regular report authoring mode , you can modify some slicer settings to make them more usable in mobile-optimized reports :
* You can decide whether to allow report readers to select only one item or multiple items .
# # Publish a mobile-optimized report
# # Viewing optimized and unoptimized reports on a phone or tablet
In the Power BI mobile apps , mobile-optimized reports are indicated by a special icon .
On phones , the app automatically detects whether the report is mobile-optimized or not .
* If a mobile-optimized report exists , the app automatically opens the report in mobile-optimized mode .
* If a mobile-optimized report doesn ’ t exist , the report opens in the unoptimized , landscape view .
Holding a phone in landscape orientation opens the report in the unoptimized view with the original report layout , regardless of whether the report is optimized or not .
# # Considerations when creating mobile-optimized layouts
* For reports with multiple pages , you can optimize all the pages or just a few .
* If you &apos;ve defined a background color for a report page , the mobile-optimized report will have the same background color .

The following actions cause the cache to be refreshed and slow down report rendering the next time you preview the report :
- Change the data source that the report uses to a different data source .
- Change the language of the report .
- Change the assemblies or custom code that the report uses .
- Add , change , or delete the query parameters in the report or parameter values .
Changes to the report layout and data formatting don &apos;t affect the cached dataset . You can do the following actions without refreshing the cached dataset :
- Add or remove data regions such as tables , matrices or charts .
- Add or delete columns from the report . All the fields in the dataset are available to use in the report . Adding or removing fields in the report has no effect on the dataset .
- Change the order of fields in tables and matrices .
- Add , change , or delete row and column groups .
- Add , change , or delete formatting of data values in fields .
- Add , change , or delete images , lines , or text boxes .

# Subscribe yourself and others to reports and dashboards in the Power BI service
- Include an attachment of the full report , if you &apos;re subscribing to a paginated report .
* * Creating * * a subscription can be done by :
- Users with a Power BI Pro license
# # Subscribe to a dashboard , report page , or paginated report
Whether you &apos;re subscribing to a dashboard , report , or paginated report , the process is similar . The same button allows you to subscribe to Power BI service dashboards and reports .
1 . Open the dashboard or report .
&gt; If you edit the subscription after saving and closing , the selection for giving users access to the content you &apos;re subscribing is enabled , regardless of your previous selections .
A subscription ends in any of these cases :
- The Pro license expires .
- The owner deletes the dashboard or report .
- The user account used to create the subscription is deleted .
- Content Subscribed to
- Modified By /
- Modified Date
- If your content isn &apos;t in a Premium capacity , only Power BI Pro users can receive email subscriptions .
- Subscriptions don &apos;t currently support bookmarks .
- Report page subscriptions are tied to the name of the report page . If you subscribe to a report page and then rename it , you have to re-create your subscription .
- Email subscriptions don &apos;t support R-powered custom visuals at this time .
- Email subscriptions are sent with the report &apos;s default filter and slicer states . Any changes to the defaults that you make after subscribing don &apos;t show up in the email . Paginated reports do support this capability and allow you to set the specific parameter values per subscription .
# Migrate SQL Server Reporting Services reports to Power BI
Guidance is divided into four stages . We recommend that you first read the entire article prior to migrating your reports .
Before you start the migration , you should verify that your environment meets certain prerequisites . We &apos;ll describe these prerequisites , and also introduce you to a helpful migration tool .
# # # Preparing for migration
You can migrate SSRS instances running on-premises , or on Virtual Machines hosted by cloud providers , like Azure .
Migration from Power BI Report Server is possible , too .
The tool automates the following tasks :
* Shared * * data sources * * become embedded data sources
* Shared * * datasets * * become embedded datasets
It doesn &apos;t modify or remove your existing reports . On completion , the tool outputs a summary of all actions completed — successful or unsuccessful .
Over time , the tool may be improved by Microsoft . The community is encouraged to contribute and help enhance it , too .
After verifying that your organization meets the pre-requisites , you &apos;re ready to start the _ Pre-migration _ stage . This stage has three phases :
The goal of the _ Discover _ phase is to identify your existing SSRS instances . This process involves scanning the network to identify all SQL Server instances in your organization .
Having discovered your SSRS instances , the goal of the _ Assess _ phase is to understand any SSRS reports — or server items — that can &apos;t be migrated .
The following SSRS item types , however , can &apos;t be migrated to Power BI :
- Resources , like image files
After preparing your Power BI environment and reports , you &apos;re ready for the _ Migration _ stage .
1 . Open the SSRS portal that contains the reports you want to migrate .
1 . Download each report definition , saving the .rdl files locally .
1 . Preview the report to ensure it renders correctly .
1 . Select the workspace that will contain the report .
There are two options for automated migration . You can use :
You can also use the publicly available SSRS and Power BI APIs to automate the migration of your content . While the RDL Migration Tool already uses these APIs , you can develop a custom tool suited to your exact requirements .
For more information about the APIs , see :
# # # Configure data sources
# # # Review report performance
We highly recommended you complete the following actions to ensure the best possible report user experience :
For more information about these issues , including specific steps to understand and mitigate them , see the following articles :
title : Use insights to find where distribution is different ( Preview )
# # Details of the returned results
Then for a particular category of product * “ Road Bike * ) the split of sales might be :
Given the nature of such measures , this * is * considered interestingly different . So for non-additive measures such as this margin example , the algorithm is looking for differences in the absolute value .
The visuals displayed are thus intended to clearly show the differences found between the overall distribution ( as seen in the original visual ) and the value with the particular filter applied .
These would get output in column order , as follows :
title : Avoid blank pages when printing paginated reports
# Avoid blank pages when printing paginated reports
Report page size properties determine the page orientation , dimensions , and margins . Access these report properties by :
Ensure all page size properties are correctly configured :
&#124; Page units &#124; Select the relevant units — inches or centimeters . &#124;
&#124; Orientation &#124; Select the correct option — portrait or landscape . &#124;
&#124; Paper size &#124; Select a paper size , or assign custom width and height values . &#124;
The page size properties determine the available space available for report objects . Report objects can be data regions , data visualizations , or other report items .
A common reason why blank pages are output , is the report body width _ exceeds the available page space _ .
Ensure the width value doesn &apos;t exceed available page width . Be guided by the following formula :
&gt; It &apos;s not possible to reduce the report body width when there are report objects already in the space you want to remove . You must first reposition or resize them before reducing the width .
&gt; Also , the report body width can increase automatically when you add new objects , or resize or reposition existing objects . The report designer always widens the body to accommodate the position and size of its contained objects .
Another reason why a blank page is output , is there &apos;s excess space in the report body , after the last object .
We recommend you always reduce the height of the body to remove any trailing space .
Ensure the * * Add a page break after * * property isn &apos;t unnecessarily enabled .

# Run Python scripts in Power BI Desktop
# # # Install required Python packages
The Power BI Python integration requires the installation of two Python packages :
To enable Python scripting :
Once you specify your Python installation , you ’ re ready to begin running Python scripts in Power BI Desktop .
In just a few steps , you can run Python scripts and create a data model . From this model , you can create reports and share them on the Power BI service .
# # # Prepare a Python script
First , create a script in your local Python development environment and make sure it runs successfully . For example , here &apos;s a simple Python script that imports pandas and uses a data frame :
When run , this script returns :
When preparing and running a Python script in Power BI Desktop , there are a few limitations :
* Only pandas data frames are imported , so make sure the data you want to import to Power BI is represented in a data frame
* Any Python script that runs longer than 30 minutes times out
* Interactive calls in the Python script , such as waiting for user input , halts the script ’ s execution
* When setting the working directory within the Python script , you * must * define a full path to the working directory , rather than a relative path
* Nested tables are currently not supported
# # # Run your Python script and import data
To run your Python Script in Power BI Desktop :
# # # # Using custom Python distributions
As a possible solution , you can start Power BI Desktop from your custom Python environment prompt .
&gt; * Import data into a dataflow
&gt; * Score sentiment and extract key phrases of a text column in a dataflow
To complete this tutorial , you need the following :
Follow the steps in this section to complete the text analytics portion of the tutorial .
The data is now ready to use for text analytics , and we can use Sentiment Scoring and Key Phrase Extraction on the customer comments column .
Once the dataflow is saved and refreshed , you can use it in a Power BI report .
As this is a preview feature , the connector will ask you to accept the preview conditions . After accepting these , sign in with your organization account .
Now the data is loaded you can start building a report .
When prompted for credentials , select * anonymous * .
You see the following image .
You &apos;re prompted for credentials for each individual web page .
Select * * AI Insights * * in the query editor .
Next , sign in with your * * organizational account * * .
&gt; You currently cannot pick a column using a dropdown , which will be resolved as soon as possible during the private preview .
In the function editor , remove the quotation marks around the column name .
&gt; Removing the quotation marks is a temporary workaround , which will be resolved as soon as possible during preview .
The function returns a record with both the tags in comma-separated format and as a json record . Select the expand-button to add one or both as columns to the table .

# Intro to dashboard tiles for Power BI designers
There are many different ways to add ( pin ) a tile to a dashboard . You can pin tiles from :
# # Interact with tiles on a dashboard
After you &apos;ve added a tile to a dashboard , you can move and resize it , or change its appearance and behavior .
# # # Move and resize a tile
1 . Hover over the tile to display the ellipsis .
2 . Select the ellipsis to open the tile action menu .
3 . To close the action menu , select a blank area in the dashboard .
# # # Select a tile
* If the report that was used to create the visualization wasn &apos;t saved , selecting the tile produces no action .
