After your pull request is submitted , you can expect one or more of the following to happen :
3 . When you &apos;re prompted , enter your two-factor authentication code .
# # # Display commonly used dev langs
You will need to provide a workflow to synchronize the Approve / Deny decision from the Investigation record to the Request record .
You can run Power Automate on all modern devices , and browsers .
# # Activate business process flow
&gt; Use simple blocks of data rather than complex table arrays .
Each input within the adaptive card form has an Id . You can use the Id later in the flow through dynamic tokens to reference inputs that a user might have entered as part of running the flow .
1 . As reporting is driven from the related entity , it &apos;s not possible to create a single view that reports on business process flows that span multiple entities .
We modified several underlying components and added several features in the February release with unattended support . You &apos;ll need to update your local UI flows app and your gateway connections to use these new features , including the unattended features .

For example , you can use the select action if data enters your flow via a web request in this format :
&#124; From &#124; Trigger a flow based on the sender &apos;s email address . &#124;
You &apos;ll notice the following subtabs :
&#124; User name &#124; The user name of the person signed into the device that &apos;s running the flow . &#124;

When connecting to a workspace , changes from new , deleted , and renamed datasets can take up to a few minutes to appear .
# # Try out the slicer
Taking the time to apply star schema design principles delivers the following benefits :
- Add or remove users that have assignment permissions .
Be sure to keep :

Each model relationship must be defined with a cross filter direction . Your selection determines the direction ( s ) that filters will propagate . The possible cross filter options are dependent on the cardinality type .
# # # Resource Manager template
To promote a dataflow , you must have write permissions the workspace where the dataflow you want to promote is located .
Let ’ s do a quick review of what we covered in this first section .
In this tutorial , you &apos;ll learn how to :
They can then be used in a variety of scenarios in your report layouts :

Import the CSS file as a `.less` file because the Power BI visuals tool wraps external CSS rules .
The refresh summaries page has two views :
Help is localized in these 10 languages :
- If you plan to deliver the report in a specific export format , test the export format early in your design . Feature support varies based on the renderer that you choose .

The possible values are :
Once you &apos;ve installed the app , just select it from your Apps list and select which dashboard or report to open and explore first .
There may be many trace files in that folder . Make sure you only send the recent files to your administrator to facilitate quickly identifying the error .
# # IT Spend Analysis Sample dashboard

The default refresh logic of linked entities changes , based on whether the source dataflow resides in the same workspace as the destination dataflow . The following sections describe the behavior of each .
The datasets workload is enabled by default and cannot be disabled . Use the following settings to control workload behavior . There is additional usage information below the table for some of the settings .
When prompted , enter your Smartsheet credentials and follow the authentication process .

The following RLS rule is applied to the * * Salesperson * * table :
1 . View a report page .
* To define the number of months starting from the current date , use * numberOfMonth *
Q &amp; A looks for an answer in the dataset ( s ) connected to the dashboard . A connected dataset is one that has at least one tile pinned to that dashboard .

When complete , you can go to Power BI directly from Excel .
As the name suggests , paginated reports can run to many pages . They &apos;re laid out in a fixed format and offer precise customization . Paginated reports are .rdl files .

The table below lists payment and usage considerations per capacity .
In a report theme JSON file , you define only the formatting that you want to change . Whatever you don &apos;t specify in the JSON file reverts to the Power BI Desktop default settings .
If you &apos;re using one of the affected themes and you don &apos;t need to modify the text settings , you can safely use the other tabs of the dialog box with no issues . However , if you want to use the text classes with one of the affected themes , you have a couple options :
If user information is excluded , the usage report refers to users as Unnamed .
2 . If your Power BI admin hasn &apos;t allowed you to create embed codes , you may need to contact them .

- R and Python visuals are not supported .
In this tutorial , we &apos;ll dig into our Retail Analysis dataset and create a few key visualizations .
Watch a video of this step :
- Create a workspace in Power BI without creating a Microsoft 365 group .
Only the dashboard or report owner can turn resharing on and off .
5 . You &apos;re warned about importing a custom visual , as shown in the following image :
- Cannot use functions that scan or return a table
# # Search within the Analytics pane
# # # Case 2 : Parent and its subsidiaries or affiliates
Now , when the guest users open the report , they only see sales from group A :
title : Use the Analyze feature to explain fluctuations in report visuals
- Model data is only as current as the latest refresh , and so Import models need to be refreshed , usually on a scheduled basis
If the user hasn &apos;t selected either a single product or a single store , the measure returns : “ Select a single product and Ctrl + click to also select a single store . ”

To use service principal and an application ID with embedded analytics , follow these steps :
* A token variable to call operations :
&gt; This data mapping can &apos;t be used in conjunction with any other data mapping . It &apos;s meant to reduce data into a single numeric value .
4 . Now you can use the data you selected to create a plot :
&gt; These flickers are more noticeable on IE and with a large number of webviews and are not recommended for iOS .
* to compare multiple measures with different value ranges .
&#124; Set alerts &#124; Can create alerts to email you when the dashboard meets certain conditions &#124; No &#124;
1 . Select the United States block in the tree map to see how it highlights related values in the other visuals .
After Q &amp; A displays your results , keep the conversation going ! Use the interactive features of the visual and of Q &amp; A to uncover more insights .
# # Using wallpaper in Power BI reports
This model design supports producing the following report design .
As a data modeler , sometimes you might need to write a DAX expression that counts table rows . The table could be a model table or an expression that returns a table .
To avoid this condition , use one of the following strategies :
- Manual refresh .
Now you see it as it will look on a printed page .
To get a larger view of the visualizations , you can minimize the * * Python script editor * * .
To create context menu , save `host` object in the properties of the visual and call `createSelectionManager` method to the create selection manager to display a context menu by using Power BI Visuals API .
Power BI selects which email to use based on the following sequence :
# # Working with filter cards
# # # Use canvas or WebGL
Say you have a chart that sums the units sold for different products , but you &apos;d rather have the average .
* Aliqui is growing , but product volume compared to us is still low .
Refreshes can be slow - or perceived to be slow ( as the previous common question addresses ) .

Certifying an updated version of a Power BI visual , can take up to three weeks .
2 . Enter search terms and then select a map layer . In this example we &apos;ve chosen USA Congressional districts .
# # # AutoML model report
* User interacts with the visual directly .
# # Can &apos;t drag anything to the PivotTable Values area ( no measures )
Here we see that the dashboard creator has already added a general comment . Anyone with access to this dashboard can see this comment .
2 . The storage account must be created in the same AAD tenant as your Power BI tenant .
* Commercial logos cannot be displayed in view mode .
