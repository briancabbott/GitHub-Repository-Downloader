- Delete all planned and firm planned production orders . Do not delete started orders with entries that are already posted .
Eduardo , the Production Planner of a small manufacturing company , is about to plan production and purchase orders to fulfill new sales demand .
In a more complex manufacturing environment , the planning worksheet is used to plan supply based on item parameters such as rescheduling period , safety lead time , reorder point , and batch calculations of consolidated demand from all product levels .
# # Setting Up the Sample Data
The standard CRONUS demonstration company currently has lots of unplanned demand . During the different planning tasks in this walkthrough , you will have to deviate from the realistic business flow by ignoring demand with close due dates and instead use demand with later due dates .
# # Using the Order Planning Window
- Manufacturing , Planning
- Purchase , Planning
# # # To use the Order Planning window
The planning system analyzes any new demand that has been introduced , such as new sales , changed sales , or production orders .
When the calculation is completed , the window displays all unfulfilled demand as collapsed order header lines sorted by earliest demand date .
# # Planning a Purchase Order to Fulfill Component Demand

# # To create a service contract or service contract quote
2 . Create a new service contract or service contract quote .
7 . Add contract lines to the service contract or service contract quote .
8 . Fill in the rest of the fields as necessary .
# # To convert a service contract quote to service contract
When a customer has accepted a service contract quote , you convert it to a service contract . At the same time , you can create a service invoice for the starting period of the contract if the starting date of the contract is before the beginning of the next invoice period .
For detailed contracts , the invoiced amount is calculated as follows :
* Invoiced amount = sum of the invoiced amount for each contract line .
* If the contract line expires before the starting period ends , the expiration date becomes the ending date of the starting period for the line .
* If the contract expires before the starting period ends , the expiration date becomes the ending date of the starting period .
2 . Open the service contract quote you want to convert to a service contract .
The service invoice is posted to the service account of the contract , even if the contract is prepaid .
# # To create contract service credit memos
You can use a contract service credit memo when a customer cancels a prepaid service contract or removes a service item from a prepaid contract . You can also use it to correct an erroneous service invoice .
2 . Create a new service credit memo .
# # Updating and evaluating contracts
# # To add a contract line to a service contract or contract quote
When a customer purchases a new item and wants to include it in the existing service contract or contract quote , you can register the item as a service item and then add it as a new contract line to the contract or contract quote .
2 . Open the relevant service contract or service contract quote that you want to add a new contract line for .
# # To remove contract lines
You may need to remove contract lines from the service contract as you remove corresponding service items from the service contract . Usually you remove a contract line that is expired or corresponds to the service item that has broken down .
2 . Open the service contract from which you want to remove contract lines .
# # Service Line Cost and Value
# # To add a contract discount to service contract quotes
You can add contract discounts on services for contract quotes and service contracts . The discounts can be on spare parts in particular service item groups , on resource hours for resources in particular resource groups , and on particular service costs .
2 . Choose the quote to add discounts for .
# # To change the owner of a service contract
You may need to change the owner of a service contract . If a service item in a service contract is registered in noncanceled multiple contracts owned by the same customer , then the owner of all service contracts that include this service item and of all other service items included in these contracts is updated automatically .
&gt; Service items and contracts can be related . Changing the owner of a service contract can affect these relationships .
# # To update a service contract price
You can update the prices on service contracts by specifying a price update percentage .
2 . Choose the service contract .
# # To post prepaid contract entries
If you work with prepaid service contracts , you must regularly post prepaid contract entries , thereby transferring the prepaid payments from the prepaid contract accounts to the regular contract accounts .

title : Design Details - Cost Adjustment
# Design Details : Cost Adjustment
The main purpose of cost adjustment is to forward cost changes from cost sources to cost recipients , according to an item ’ s costing method , to provide correct inventory valuation .
The following are secondary purposes , or functions , of cost adjustment :
* Invoice finished production orders :
* Update the unit cost on the item card .
# # Detecting the Adjustment
* Average Cost Adjustment Entry Point
# # # Item Application Entry
* Cost adjustment is detected by marking the source item ledger entries as * Applied Entry to Adjust * whenever an item ledger entry or value entry is posted .
# # # Average Cost Adjustment Entry Point
This detection function is used for items that use the Average costing method . The function works as follows :
* Cost is forwarded by applying the costs to value entries with a later valuation date .
* Cost adjustment is detected by marking the order whenever a material / resource is posted as consumed / used .
* Cost is forwarding by applying the costs from material / resource to the output entries associated with the same order .
The Order Level function is used to detect adjustments in assembly posting . The following graphic shows the adjustment entry structure :
# # Manual versus Automatic Cost Adjustment
Cost adjustment can be performed in two ways :
It is good practice to run the cost adjustment automatically when you post because unit costs are more frequently updated and therefore more accurate . The disadvantage is that the performance of the database can be affected by running the cost adjustment so often .
# # Adjust Cost - Item Entries Batch Job
&gt; We recommend that you always run the batch job for all items and only use the filtering option to reduce the runtime of the batch job , or to fix the cost of a certain item .
* * Relation Entries in the G / L – Item Ledger Relation Table * *
&#124; Never &#124; Costs are not adjusted when you post . &#124;
&#124; Day &#124; Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one day from the work date . &#124;
&#124; Week &#124; Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one week from the work date . &#124;
&#124; Month &#124; Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one month from the work date . &#124;
&#124; Quarter &#124; Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one quarter from the work date . &#124;
&#124; Year &#124; Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one year from the work date . &#124;
The following example shows an automatic cost adjustment scenario :
* On January 10 , you post a purchased item as received and invoiced .
* On January 15 , you post a sales order for the item as shipped and invoiced .
If you have set up the automatic cost adjustment to apply to postings that occur within a month or a quarter from the current work date , then the automatic cost adjustment runs and forwards the cost of the purchase to the sale .

# How to : Set Up Shop Calendars
As a foundation for calculating a specific work or machine center calendar , you must first set up one or more general shop calendars . A shop calendar defines a standard work week according to start and end times of each working day and the work shift relation . In addition , the shop calendar defines the fixed holidays during a year .
The following describes how to set up work center calendars . The steps are similar when setting up machine center calendars .
# # To create work shifts
4 . Optionally , fill in lines for a second or third work shift .
Even if your work centers do not work in different work shifts , enter at least one work shift code .
# # To set up a shop calendar
If you need a shop calendar with two work shifts , you must fill it in in this manner :
Any week days that you do not define in the shop calendar , such as Saturday and Sunday , are considered non-working days and will have zero available capacity in a work center calendar .
The defined holidays will have zero available capacity in a work center calendar .
The shop calendar can now be assigned to a work center to calculate the work shop calendar that will govern all operation scheduling at that work center .
# # To calculate a work center calendar
2 . Open the work center that you want to update .
To reflect the new shop calendar as a line on the selected work center , it must first be calculated .
Calendar entries are now created or updated displaying the available capacity for each period according to the following three sets of master data :
- The working days and shift defined in the assigned shop calendar .
The calculated work center calendar will now define when and how much capacity is available at this work center . This controls the detailed scheduling of operations performed at the work center .
# # To record work center absence
The capacity of the selected day has now decreased by the recorded absence time .
You can create a campaign card for each campaign that you want to keep track of . You can also view these campaign cards to view general information about your campaigns .
You can delete campaign entries , such as if the entry records an action that has been canceled . Only canceled campaign entries can be deleted .
# # # Selecting the target audience
# # # Registering discount percentages
When you have set up the sales prices / line discounts and the segments on the campaign card , you must activate them so that the campaign prices / discounts will be reflected on the lines .
As a campaign runs , all interactions with your contacts , or segment , are recorded so that you can get statistics and other information about the costs and success rates of the campaign .
title : Using the Quickbooks Payroll File Import Extension
# The Quickbooks Payroll File Import Extension to Dynamics NAV
To account for salary payments and related transactions , you must import and post financial transactions made by your payroll provider to the general ledger .
The Quickbooks Payroll File Import extension allows you to import payroll transaction from the Quickbooks Payroll service .
title : Work with Dimensions
The more dimensions you use , the more detailed reports you can base your business decisions on . For example , a single sales entry can include multiple dimension information , such as :
* The account the item sale was posted to
* Where the item was sold
* Who sold it
* The kind of customer who bought it
A dimension set is a unique combination of dimension values . It is stored as dimension set entries in the database . Each dimension set entry represents a single dimension value . The dimension set is identified by a common dimension set ID that is assigned to each dimension set entry that belongs to the dimension set .
You can also set up some global and shortcut dimensions :
# # # Translating the Names of Dimensions
&#124; AREA &#124; Area &#124; Area Code &#124; Area Filter &#124;
&#124; DEPARTMENT &#124; Department &#124; Department Code &#124; Department Filter &#124;
If you work in a journal instead , you can add dimension information to an entry in the same way , if you have set up shortcut dimensions as fields directly on journal lines .
You can set up default dimensions for accounts or account types , so that dimensions and dimension values are filled in automatically .
title : Create Incoming Documents From Documents
# How to : Create Incoming Document Records Directly from Documents and Entries
The following procedures show how to attach a file to an existing purchase invoice that was not created from an incoming document record and how to attach a file to a vendor ledger entry . Attaching a file to posted purchase or sales documents works in a similar way .
# # To create and connect an incoming document record from a purchase invoice
# # To create and connect an incoming document record from a vendor ledger entry
# # To remove a connection from an incoming document record to a posted document
You can remove file attachments from non-posted documents at any time by deleting the related incoming document record . If the document is posted , then you must first remove the connection from the incoming document record .
The connection to the posted document is removed . You can now proceed to connect another incoming document record to the posted document as described in this topic .

title : Walkthrough - Conducting a Sales Campaign
You use these features in Sales &amp; Marketing to carefully plan your marketing activities and to manage your interactions with contacts and customers . You can create campaigns and set up segments of your contacts for mailings and other types of interactions with your contacts and prospective customers .
The Campaign and Segment features with their automated processes enable you to plan , organize , and keep track of your marketing activities . This will increase the chances of winning new customers and retaining existing customers .
This walkthrough demonstrates the process for following up on a trade show and targeting potential customers ( contacts ) in a follow-up campaign .
The walkthrough introduces the campaign and segment management feature in the Sales &amp; Marketing department . This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks :
- Setting up a campaign .
- Selecting the target audience .
- Sending letters to contacts .
- Registering campaign responses .
- Marketing Manager or Sales Manager
The marketing staffer in the Marketing department handles producing , distributing , and placing marketing material .
One of the marketing staffer ’ s tasks after the trade show is to enter all the potential customers as contacts .
The marketing manager sets up a campaign , creates a segment that contains all the new contacts and then mines the contact data to select the target audience for the campaign .
The staffer helps send out thank you letters to all the contacts who left their cards with the staff at the stand , and finally , the manager records all the responses they receive from the prospective customers .
# # Setting Up a Campaign
As soon as the staffer has entered the business cards received at the trade show , the marketing manager sets up a campaign card to manage the activities involved in the campaign .
# # # To set up a campaign
# # Selecting the Target Audience
The marketing manager creates a segment to select the contacts that he wants to interact with .
# # # To create a segment with the relevant contacts
&gt; You can save your segmentation criteria to be reused at a later stage .
# # # To remove contacts from the segment
&gt; The contacts that you just removed are added back to the list of contacts .
# # Linking a Segment to a Campaign
The marketing manager decides that the reduced list is the final list of contacts that he wants to be part of the campaign . He therefore links this segment to the campaign FUTURUS trade show .
# # # To link a segment to the campaign
# # Sending Letters and Email Messages to Contacts
The marketing staffer helps the marketing manager send out correspondence to the prospective customers , in which he thanks them for visiting the trade show .
&gt; This template consists of more than one attachment document , each of them written in a different language . Example languages include English and Danish .
This opens the attached Word document so that you can inspect it . You can also take this opportunity to edit and modify the letter . Close Word when you are finished .
# # # To send an email message to a contact
4 . Specify language settings , as in the previous procedure .
During the next couple of weeks , the prospective customers respond to the letter . The marketing manager wants to keep track of the responses and record these interactions .
For this purpose , set up a segment for the contacts who have responded to the letter .
# # # To register campaign responses
There is no interaction template for recording responses to campaigns . Therefore , create a new template .
Now specify that these contacts have responded to the campaign :
Log the segment to make sure that the interactions are recorded .
title : About Calculating Standard Cost
# # Setting Up Standard Costs
The accounting task for an item-processing company using standard costing is to :
- Estimate a standard cost of the finished item and set it up on the item card .
- Record and allocate the actual cost of the key cost elements and to account for variances .
To determine the direct cost of a finished item , all component costs must be totaled . An assembled or produced item can include subassemblies , which also consist of multiple components .
The following key cost elements make up the total direct cost of a finished processed item :
- Subcontracting costs for produced items only .
Material costs are costs that are associated with subassemblies and purchased raw material . Material unit cost can consist of direct and indirect cost elements .
- Direct material cost represents an invoiced amount for purchased raw materials or the processing cost of a subassembly .
The material cost of a produced item can be represented in two ways that correspond to the following cost calculation bases .
&#124; Cost Calculation Basis &#124; Material Cost Calculation &#124;
&#124; Single level &#124; Produced item is equal to the total cost of all purchased or subassembled items on that item &apos;s production BOM . &#124;
The setup of the capacity costs of assembled items consists of the following elements :
- Direct and indirect unit cost of the resource .

title : Design Details - Item Application
# Design Details : Item Application
&#124; Quantity application &#124; Created for all inventory transactions &#124;
&#124; Cost application &#124; Created for inbound entries together with a quantity application as a result of user interaction in special processes . &#124;
Item applications can be made in the following ways .
&#124; Automatic &#124; Occurs as general cost forwarding according to the costing method &#124; Quantity application &#124;
Whether quantity applications or cost applications are made depends on the direction of the inventory transaction and whether the item application is made automatically or fixed , in connection with special processes .
The following table shows , based on the central application fields on inventory transaction lines , how costs flow depending on the transaction direction . It also indicates when and why the item application is of type quantity or cost .
&gt; A sales return is NOT considered a cost source when fixed applied .
&gt; The sales entry remains open until the real source is posted .
An item application entry records the following information .
When you post an inventory increase , then a simple item application entry is recorded without an application to an outbound entry .
The following table shows the item application entry that is created when you post a purchase receipt of 10 units .
The following example shows the item application entry that is created when you post a sales shipment of 5 units of the items that were received in the previous example . The first item application entry is the purchase receipt . The second application entry is the sales shipment .
The following table shows the two item application entries that result from the inventory increase and the inventory decrease , respectively .
# # # Example – Fixed Application in Purchase Return
1 . In entry number 1 , the user posts a purchase at a cost of LCY 10.00 .
2 . In entry number 2 , the user posts a purchase at a cost of LCY 20.00 .
The following table shows item ledger entries resulting from the scenario .
The following table shows the item application entry that results from the fixed application .
The cost of the second purchase , LCY 20.00 , is passed correctly to the purchase return .
# # # Example – Fixed Application with Average Cost
3 . In entry number 4 , the user posts another purchase invoice with the correct direct unit cost of LCY 100.00
4 . In entry number 5 , the user posts a sales invoice .
5 . The inventory quantity is 0 , and the inventory value is also 0.00
The following table shows the result of the scenario on the item ’ s value entries .
The following table shows the result on the item ’ s value entries if step 2 in the previous scenario is performed without a fixed application .
Fixed applications are also a very good means of reversing cost exactly , such as with sales returns .
The following example , which illustrates how a fixed application ensures exact cost reversal , is based on the following scenario :
1 . The user posts a purchase invoice .
2 . The user posts a sales invoice .
The following table shows the result of scenario steps 1 through 3 on the item ’ s value entries .
The following table shows the value entry resulting from scenario step 4 , posting the item charge .
The following table shows the effect of the exact cost reversal on the item ’ s value entries .
# # # Example – Average Costing Method
1 . The user purchases the item at a cost of LCY 10.00 .
2 . The user purchases the item again at a cost of LCY 20.00 .
3 . The user transfers the item from BLUE to RED location .
The following table shows the effect of the transfer on the item ’ s value entries .
# # # Example – Standard Costing Method
1 . The user purchases the item at a standard cost of LCY 10.00 .
2 . The user transfers the item from BLUE to RED location at a standard cost of LCY 12.00 .
Since the value of the original inventory increase is LCY 10.00 , the transfer is valued at that cost , not at LCY 12.00 .
Because of the way an item ’ s unit cost is calculated , an incorrect item application could lead to a skewed average cost and unit cost . The following scenarios may cause incorrect item applications , which require that you undo item applications and reapply item ledger entries :
* You have forgotten to make a fixed application .
* You have made an incorrect fixed application .

You can choose to have VAT amounts calculated and posted to a temporary general ledger account when an invoice is posted , and then posted to the correct general ledger account and included in VAT statements when the actual payment of the invoice is posted . Before you can do this , you must complete the VAT posting setup .
To use accounts for unrealized VAT , follow these steps :
&#124; Blank &#124; Choose this option if you don &apos;t want to use the unrealized VAT feature . &#124;
&#124; Percentage &#124; Payments covers both VAT and the invoice amount in proportion to the payment &apos;s percentage of the remaining invoice amount . The paid VAT amount is transferred from the unrealized VAT account to the realized VAT account . &#124;
&gt; The VAT amount will be posted to this account , and stay there until the customer payment is posted . The amount is then transferred to the account for sales VAT .
title : Design Details - The Role of the Reorder Point
# Design Details : The Role of the Reorder Point
In addition to the general balancing of supply and demand , the planning system must also monitor inventory levels for the affected items to respect the defined reordering policies .
Accordingly , the planning system will suggest a forward-scheduled supply order at the point when the projected inventory passes below the reorder point .
The reorder point reflects a certain inventory level . However , inventory levels can move significantly during the time bucket and , therefore , the planning system must constantly monitor the projected available inventory .

# How to : Work with Serial and Lot Numbers
# # About Picking Serial or Lot Numbers in the Warehouse
Outbound handling of serial or lot numbers is a frequent task in different warehouse processes .
In some processes , the inventory items do not carry serial or lot numbers , and the warehouse worker must assign new during the outbound handling , typically from a predefined number series .
In simple processes , the inventory items already carry serial or lot numbers , for example assigned during the put-away , and these numbers are automatically transferred through all outbound warehouse activities without interaction by warehouse workers .
# # To set up item tracking codes
An item tracking code reflects the different considerations a company has regarding the use of serial and lot numbers for items moving through the inventory .
# # # To set up expiration rules for serial or lot numbers
For some items you might want to set up specific expiration dates and rules in the item tracking code . This functionality allows you to keep track of when specific serial numbers and lot numbers expire .
# # # To set up warranties for serial or lot numbers
For some items , you might want to set up specific warranties in the item tracking code . This functionality allows you to keep track of when the warranties on specific serial or lot numbers in your inventory will run out .
# # To record serial or lot number information
If you need to link special information to a specific item tracking number , for example , for quality assurance , you can do so in a serial or lot number information card .
1 . Open a document that has serial or lot numbers assigned .
# # To modify existing serial or lot number information
2 . Select an item that has an item tracking code and has serial or lot number information .
# # To assign serial or lot numbers during an inbound transaction
You can assign serial or lot numbers in the following ways :
- Manually , by entering serial or lot numbers directly , for example , the vendor &apos;s numbers .
When the document is posted , the item tracking entries are carried to the associated item ledger entries .
# # To assign a serial or lot number during an outbound transaction
There are two ways to add serial and lot numbers to outbound transactions :
- Assigning new serial or lot numbers during outbound transactions . This applies when item tracking numbers are not assigned to items until they are sold and ready to be shipped .
You can assign item tracking numbers in the following ways :
- Manually , by entering serial or lot numbers , without using a number series .
# # To select from existing serial or lot numbers
When you are working with items that require item tracking and you are creating outbound transactions , where the items go out of inventory , you typically need to select the lot or serial numbers from those that already exist in inventory .
1 . From any outbound document , select the line that you want to select serial or lot numbers for .
6 . Type or scan in the item tracking number .
When you post the document line , the item tracking information is transferred to the associated item ledger entries .
# # To handle serial and lot numbers on transfer orders
Procedures for handling serial and lot numbers that are being transferred between different locations are similar to those applied when items are sold and purchased .
When handling serial and lot numbers for transfer items , the items typically have numbers already assigned to them . Therefore , the process typically consists of selecting from existing serial or lot numbers .
4 . Post the transfer order , first ship and then receive , to record that the items are transferred carrying their item tracking entries .
# # To handle serial and lot numbers when getting receipt lines from a purchase invoice

title : About Production Orders
Production orders are used to manage the conversion of purchased materials into manufactured items . Production orders route work through various work or machine centers on the shop floor .
Production orders are the central components of the program &apos;s manufacturing functionality and they contain the following information :
- Products planned for manufacturing
- Materials required for the planned production orders
- Products that have just been manufactured
- Materials that have already been selected
- Products that have been manufactured in the past
- Materials that were used in previous manufacturing operations
Production orders are the starting points for :
- Planning future manufacturing
- Controlling current manufacturing
- Tracking of finished manufacturing
Production orders are created using information from :
# # Limitations on Production Order Creation
Production orders are automatically reserved and tracked to their source when :
- Created with the Order function in the * * Sales Order Planning * * window
- Created from the * * Order Planning * * window
- Using the * * Replan * * function on production orders
# # Production Order Status
# # # Simulated Production Order
The Simulated Production Order is unique based on the following characteristics :
- As its name implies , it is a simulation and its main purpose is for quoting and costing - such as when the Research and Development department wants to get a cost estimate on a proposed item . A simulated production order serves as an example of a production order .
# # # Planned Production Order
The Planned Production Order is unique because of the following characteristics :
- You can automatically create a planned production order from a sales order .
- Planned production orders are like released production orders and provide input to capacity requirements planning by showing the total capacity requirements by work center or machine center .
# # # Firm Planned Production Order
The Firm Planned Production Order is unique because of the following characteristics :
- You can automatically create a firm planned production order from a sales order .
- A firm planned production order acts as a placeholder in the planning schedule for some future job released to the floor .
- A firm planned production order can be generated from planning or created manually or from sales orders . They are not erased during subsequent planning .
# # # Released Production Order
The Released Production Order is unique based on the following characteristics :
- You can automatically create a released production order from a sales order .
- When a production order has been released , it does not necessarily mean that materials have been picked or the job has physically moved to its first operation .
- In a MTO ( Make-to-Order ) environment , it is not unusual to create a released production order immediately after the entry of the sales order .
- Actual material consumption and product output can be recorded manually with a released production order . In addition , automatic flushing of consumption and product output only occurs for released production orders .
The Finished Production Order is unique based on the following characteristics :
- A finished production order is typically one that has been manufactured .
- Finishing the production order is an important task in completing the costing lifecycle of the item that is being produced . By finishing a production order , costing can be adjusted and reconciled .
- Finished production orders can never be changed .
Once a production order has been created and scheduled , it has to be released to the shop floor to be executed . During execution of the order , you record :
- Materials picked or consumed
- How much time was spent working on the order
- Quantity of the parent item produced
This information can be recorded manually or through automatic reporting , according to the items setup in the Flushing Method field .
Consumption of materials may be processed through the consumption journal , but also may be recorded automatically by the program , known as automatic reporting . The reporting methods are :
Manual consumption reporting uses the consumption journal to specify material picking .
- All items in the top-level production BOM need to have forward flushing selected on their respective item card .
- All routing link codes on the production BOM must be removed .
- Forward Flush the Entire Order
- Forward Flushing by Operation
- Back Flushing by Operation
- Back Flushing the Entire Order
# # # # Automatic Reporting - Forward Flush the Entire Order
- The entire contents of the production BOM are consumed and deducted from inventory at the time the released production order is refreshed .
- There is no need to record any information in the consumption journal if all of the items are to be flushed .
- When consuming items from inventory , it does not matter when output journal entries are made , because the output journal has no effect on this mode of consumption posting .
- No routing link codes can be set .
Forward flushing an entire order is suited in production environments with :
- A low number of defects
- A low number of operations
- High component consumption in early operations
# # # # Automatic Reporting - Forward Flushing by Operation
The amount of the flush is for the quantity per assembly stated on the production BOM multiplied by the number of parent items being built ( expected quantity ) .
Material can be consumed during operations by using routing link codes . Some components may not be used until final assembly operations and should not be withdrawn from stock until that time .
# # # # Automatic Reporting - Back Flushing by Operation
Back flushing by operation records consumption after the operation is posted in the output journal .
The advantage of this method is that the number of parent parts finished in the operation is known .
Material in the production BOM is linked to the routing records using routing link codes . The back flush takes place when an operation with a particular routing link code is posted with a finished quantity .
The amount of the flush is for the quantity per assembly stated on the production BOM multiplied by the number of parent items that were posted as output quantity at that operation . This might be different from the expected quantity .
# # # # Automatic Reporting - Back Flushing the Entire Order
This reporting method does not consider routing link codes .
No components are picked until the released production order status is changed to * Finished * . The amount of the flush is the quantity per assembly stated on the production BOM multiplied by the number of parent items that were finished and placed into inventory .
Output may be processed through the output journal , but also may be recorded automatically by the program . The program copies the flushing method from the machine center or work center card to the production order routing when refreshing . As with material consumption , there are three reporting methods for output :
# # # Posting Consumption and Output
The Production Journal combines the functions of the Consumption Journal and Output Journals into one journal , which is accessed directly from the Released Production Order .
The purpose of the Production Journal is to provide a single interface for you to register consumption and output from a Production Order .
The Production Journal has a simple view and provides you with the ability to :
- Easily record output and consumption related to a Production Order
- Relate the components to operations
- Relate actual operation data with the standard estimates on the Production Order routing and component lines
- Post and print an overview of registered operation data for the Production Order
The Production Journal performs many of the same functions as the Consumption and Output journals . Dimensions , Item Tracking , and Bin Contents are handled in the same way as on the Consumption and Output journals .
However , the Production Journal differs from the Consumption and Output journals in the following ways :
- It is called directly from a released production order line and preset with the relevant data .
- It allows you to define which types of components to handle based on a flushing method filter on the journal .
- Quantities and times already posted for the order are displayed at the bottom of the journal as actual entries .
- Fields where data entry is irrelevant are blank and non-editable .
- If you happen to exit the journal without posting your changes , a request message is displayed allowing you to stay in the journal .
- It displays operations and components together in a logical structure that provides an overview of the production process .

The following scenarios might require that you undo an application or reapply item ledger entries :
- You have forgotten to make a fixed application .
- You have to return an item to which a sale has already been applied .
&gt; The following are important considerations to remember when you are working with the application worksheet :
&gt; - You should only reapply item ledger entries during nonworking hours to avoid conflicts with other users who are posting transactions with the same items .
&gt; - The application worksheet cannot make an application in the following situation : If there is not enough quantity on stock to apply , the application worksheet cannot make an application when you are trying to apply an inventory decrease entry without item tracking information to an inventory increase entry with item tracking information .
# # To remove an item application by using the Application Worksheet

title : Use Purchase Credit Memos to Process Returns or Cancellations
# How to : Process Purchase Returns or Cancellations
If you want to return items to your vendor or cancel services that you have purchased , then you can create and post a purchase credit memo that specifies the requested change with regard to the original purchase invoice . To include the correct purchase invoice information , you can create the purchase credit memo directly from the posted purchase invoice or you can create a new purchase credit memo with copied invoice information .
Typically , you create a purchase credit memo or purchase return order in reaction to a credit memo sent to you by a vendor . The purchase credit memo or purchase return order functions as your internal documentation of the credit memo process for accounting purposes or to control the shipping of the involved items .
The change may relate to all the products on the original purchase invoice or only to some of the products . Accordingly , you can partially return received items or demand partial reimbursement of received services . In that case , you must edit the information on the purchase credit memo or purchase return order .
In addition to the original posted purchase invoice , you can apply the purchase credit memo or purchase return order to other purchase documents , for example another posted purchase invoice because you are also returning items delivered with that invoice .
The credit memo posting will also revert any item charges that were assigned to the posted document , so that the item ’ s value entries are the same as before the item charge was assigned .
To preserve correct inventory valuation , you typically want to pick return items from inventory at the unit cost that they were purchased at , not at their current unit cost . This is referred to as exact cost reversing .
Two functions exist to assign exact cost reversing automatically .
# # To create a purchase credit memo from a posted purchase invoice
Most fields on the purchase credit memo header are filled with the information from the posted purchase invoice . You can edit all the fields , for example with new information that reflects the return agreement .
3 . Edit information on the lines according to the agreement , such as the number of items returned or the amount to be reimbursement .
When you have created or edited the needed purchase credit memo lines and the single or multiple applications are specified , you can proceed to post the purchase credit memo .
The purchase credit memo is removed and replaced with a new document in the list of posted purchase credit memos .
9 . Complete the purchase credit memo as explained in the &quot; To create a purchase credit memo from a posted purchase invoice &quot; section in this topic .
# # To create a purchase return order based on one or more a posted purchase documents
&gt; This field only works for posted receipts and posted invoice lines , not for posted return or posted credit memo lines .
At the left side of the window , the different document types are listed , and the number in brackets shows the number of documents available of each document type .
8 . Select the lines that you would like to copy to the new document .
The following processes occur :
- If the copied document is a posted invoice or credit memo , the unit price , invoice discounts , and line discounts from the posted document line are copied .
# # To create a replacement purchase order from a purchase return order
You may agree with your vendor that they compensate you for a purchased item by replacing the item . The replacement item can be the same or it can be different . This situation could occur if the vendor mistakenly shipped the wrong item .
# # To create a purchase allowance
If you receive items from your vendor that are not what you wanted , for example , if they are slightly damaged , the wrong color or the wrong size , the vendor may offer you a purchase allowance .
You can post this reduced purchase cost as an item charge on a credit memo or return order and link it to the posted receipt . The following describes it for a purchase return order , but the same steps apply to a purchase credit memo .
3 . Fill in the credit memo header with information about the vendor who sent you the purchase allowance .
You may want to create a special item charge number to cover purchase allowances .
When you post the purchase return order , the purchase allowance is added to the relevant purchase entry amount . In this way , you can maintain accurate inventory valuation .
# # To combine return shipments
When you ship the items , you post the related purchase return orders as shipped and this creates posted purchase return shipments .
When you are ready to invoice these items , instead of invoicing each purchase return order separately , you can create a purchase credit memo and automatically copy the posted purchase return shipment lines to this document . Then you can post the purchase credit memo and conveniently invoice all the open purchase return orders at the same time .
&gt; The following procedure assumes that there are several purchase return orders for the vendor , and that they have been posted as shipped .
# # # To remove open purchase return orders after combined return shipment posting
3 . Alternatively , delete the individual purchase return orders manually .
When you first log in to the accountant portal , the dashboard shows a sample client to help you get started . Once you are comfortable , you can remove that sample client .
# # # Working with Individual Clients

# Design Details : Integration with Inventory
The Warehouse Management application area and the Inventory application area interact with one another in physical inventory and in inventory or warehouse adjustment .
If the counted quantity is greater than the quantity on the journal line , a movement is posted for this difference from the default adjustment bin to the counted bin . This increases the quantity in the counted bin and decreases the quantity in the default adjustment bin .
If the quantity counted is less than the quantity on the journal line , a movement for this difference is posted from the counted bin to the default adjustment bin . This decreases the quantity in the counted bin and increases the quantity in the default adjustment bin .
When you post the physical inventory journal , the inventory and the default adjustment bin are updated .
# # # Warehouse Adjustments to the Item Ledger
&gt; The adjustment bin is not included in the availability calculation .
If you enter a positive quantity and post the line , then the inventory stored in the bin increases , and the quantity of the default adjustment bin decreases correspondingly .
To get started , see the following topics :
title : Design Details - Availability in the Warehouse
# Design Details : Availability in the Warehouse
The system must keep a constant control of item availability in the warehouse , so that outbound orders can flow efficiently and provide optimal deliveries .
Availability varies depending on allocations at the bin level when warehouse activities such as picks and movements occur and when the inventory reservation system imposes restrictions to comply with . A rather complex algorithm verifies that all conditions are met before allocating quantities to picks for outbound flows .
# # Bin Content and Reservations
Special functionality in the picking algorithm exists to calculate the quantity that is available to pick when bin content is coupled with reservations .
# # # Calculating the Quantity Available to Pick
The quantity available to pick is calculated as follows :
The following diagram shows the different elements of the calculation .
Because the concepts of bin content and reservation co-exist , the quantity of items that are available to reserve must be aligned with allocations to outbound warehouse documents .
- Quantity on unregistered pick documents
- Quantity in shipment bins
- Quantity in to-production bins
- Quantity in open shop floor bins
- Quantity in to-assembly bins
- Quantity in adjustment bins
# # # Calculating the Quantity Available to Reserve
The quantity available to reserve is calculated as follows :
quantity available to reserve = total quantity in inventory - quantity on picks and movements for source documents - reserved quantity - quantity in outbound bins
title : Design Details - Balancing Supply with Demand
# Design Details : Balancing Supply with Demand
The core of the planning system involves balancing demand and supply by means of suggesting user actions to revise the supply orders in case of imbalance . This takes place per combination of variant and location .
2 . Demand exists but there is no supply = &gt; supply should be suggested .
4 . Both demand and supply exist = &gt; questions should be asked and answered before the system can ensure that demand will be met and supply is sufficient .
If the timing of the supply is not suitable , perhaps the supply can be rescheduled as follows :
1 . If the supply is placed earlier than the demand , perhaps the supply can be rescheduled out so that inventory is as low as possible .
3 . If the supply meets the demand on the date , the planning system can proceed to investigate whether the quantity of the supply can cover the demand .
Once the timing is in place , the adequate quantity to be supplied can be calculated as follows :
6 . The current demand can be covered , in which case it can be closed and planning for the next demand can start .
7 . The supply has reached its maximum , leaving some of the demand quantity uncovered . In this case , the planning system can close the current supply and proceed to the next one .
The procedure starts all over with the next demand and the current supply or vice versa . The current supply might be able to cover this next demand as well , or the current demand has not yet been fully covered .
# # Rules Concerning Actions for Supply Events
In general , all supply has a planning flexibility that is limited by the conditions of each of the suggested actions .
- It represents inventory ( always on day zero ) .
- It has an order-to-order linked to another demand .
- It lies outside the reschedule window defined by the time bucket .
- There is a closer supply that could be used .
- On the other hand , the user may decide not to reschedule because :
- The supply order has already been tied to another demand on a previous date .
- The needed rescheduling is so minimal that the user finds it negligible .
- It is linked directly to some other demand .
&gt; When planning an item using a reorder point , the supply order can always be scheduled in if necessary . This is common in forward-scheduled supply orders triggered by a reorder point .
&gt; Even though it is possible to increase the supply order , it may be limited due to a defined maximum order quantity .
&gt; Even though the quantity could be decreased , there may still be some surplus compared to the demand due to a defined minimum order quantity or order multiple .
# # Determining the Supply Quantity
Planning parameters defined by the user control the suggested quantity of each supply order .
When the planning system calculates the quantity of a new supply order or the quantity change on an existing one , the suggested quantity may be different from what is actually demanded .
1 . Down to the maximum order quantity ( if any ) .
2 . Up to the minimum order quantity .
# # Order Tracking Links during Planning
Concerning order tracking during planning , it is important to mention that the planning system rearranges the dynamically created order tracking links for the item / variant / location combinations .
There are two reasons for this :
- The planning system must be able to justify its suggestions ; that all demand has been covered , and that no supply orders are superfluous .
- Dynamically created order tracking links need to be rebalanced regularly .
Over time , dynamic order tracking links become out of balance since the entire order tracking network is not rearranged until a demand or supply event is actually closed .
&gt; Even if the item is not set up for dynamic order tracking , the planned system will create balanced order tracking links as explained above .

General ledger entries are transferred if :
- The entries have dimension values corresponding to either a cost center or a cost object .
- The document number in the entries is empty , so it will appear with a document number of 0000 in the cost entries .
- The entries are transferred to a cost type that allows for combined entries and these entries are transferred as a combined entry either monthly or daily .
General ledger entries are not transferred if :
- The entries have dimension values that do not correspond to a cost center or a cost object .
- The entries have an amount of zero .
- The entries have a general ledger account that has been deleted .
- The entries have a general ledger account that is not assigned a cost type .
- The entries have been posted with a closing date . These are typically entries that set back the balance of the income statement at the end of the year .

title : How to Subcontract Manufacturing
# How to : Subcontract Manufacturing
Subcontracting selected operations to vendor is common in many manufacturing companies . Subcontracting can be a rare occurrence or can be an integral part of all production processes .
The program provides several tools for managing subcontract work :
Subcontract Work Centers are set up the same as regular work centers with additional information . They are assigned to routings in the same manner as other work centers .
# # # Subcontract Work Center Fields
# # # Routings that use Subcontract Work Centers
Subcontract work centers can be used for operations on routings in the same way as regular work centers .
Once you have calculated the subcontracting worksheet , the relevant document , in this case a purchase order , is created .
# # # How to : Calculate Subcontracting Worksheets and Create Subcontract Purchase Orders
# # # To calculate the subcontracting worksheet
# # # To create the subcontract purchase order
If all subcontracted operations are sent to the same vendor location , then only one purchase order is created .
The worksheet line that was turned into a purchase order is deleted from the worksheet . Once a purchase order is created , it will not appear in the worksheet again .
# # Posting Subcontract Purchase Orders
Once the Subcontractor Purchase Orders have been created , they can be posted . Receiving the order posts a Capacity Ledger Entry to the production order and invoicing the order posts the direct cost of the purchase order to the production order .
&gt; Posting output automatically for an ongoing production order when subcontracted items are received may not be desired . Reasons for this could be that the expected output quantity that is posted may be different from the actual quantity and that the posting date of the automatic output is misleading .
# # To post a subcontract purchase order
When the purchase order is posted as invoiced , then the direct cost of the purchase order is posted to the production .

There are many general functions that help you enter data in a quick and easy way . The general functions for entering data are described in this article .
The examples in this article use the demonstration data .
# # Finding Data As You Type
When you start to type characters in a field , a drop-down list is displayed and shows possible field values . The list changes as you type more characters , and you can select the correct value when it is displayed .
- Lookup - Displays information from another table that you can enter in the field . You can select one piece of data at a time .
- Drop-down - Displays the set of options that exist for the field . You can select only one of the options .
# # Entering Quantities by Calculation
- If you enter 41-9 , the field is calculated to 32 .
You can enter negative numbers in two ways . The number -20.5 can be entered as :
In both cases , the amount will be recorded in as -20.5 .
# # Entering Dates and Times
You can enter dates and times in all the fields that are specifically assigned to dates ( date fields ) . You can enter dates with or without separators .
In a date field you can enter two , four , six , or eight digits :
- If you enter only two digits , this is interpreted as the day , and it will add the month and the year of the work date .
- If you enter four digits , this is interpreted as the day and the month , and it will add the year of the work date .
- If the date you want to enter is in the range 01 / 01 / 1930 through 12 / 31 / 2029 , you can enter the year with two digits ; otherwise , enter the year with four digits .
You can also enter a date as a weekday followed by a week number and , optionally , a year ( for example , Mon25 or mon25 means Monday in week 25 ) .
Instead of entering a specific date , you can enter one of two codes .
The following table lists the various ways in which times can be entered and how they are interpreted .
When you enter datetimes you must enter a space between the date and the time .
The following table lists the various ways in which you can enter datetimes and how they are interpreted .
&#124; t time &#124; today &apos;s date actual time &#124;
You enter a duration as a number followed by its unit of measure .
Here are some examples .
You can also enter a number and it is automatically converted to a duration . The number you enter is converted according to the default unit of measure that has been specified for the duration field .
To see what unit of measure is being used in a duration field , enter a number and see which unit of measure it is converted to .
The number 5 is converted to 5 hrs , if the unit of measure is hours .
A date formula is a short , abbreviated combination of letters and numbers that specifies how to calculate dates . You can enter date formulas in various date calculation fields and in recurring frequency fields in recurring journals .
Here are some examples of how date formulas can be used :
- The date formula in the recurring frequency field in recurring journals determines how often the entry on the journal line will be posted .
- The date formula in the Due Date Calculation field determines how to calculate the due date on the reminder .
The date calculation formula can contain a maximum of 20 characters , both numbers and letters . You can use the following letters , which are abbreviations for time specifications .

# How to : Replan or Refresh Production Orders Directly
Based on the changes you have made to the components and routing lines , the Replan function calculates and plans for any new demand for the production order .
The * * Refresh * * function on production orders is typically used after you have done one of the following :
- Created a production order header manually to calculate and create line data for the first time .
- Made changes to the production order header to recalculate all the line data .
The Refresh function calculates changes made to a production order header and does not involve production BOM levels . The function calculates and initiates the values of the component lines and routing lines based on the master data defined in the assigned production BOM and routing , according to the order quantity and due date on the production order ’ s header .
You can either insert the production order lines manually or use the function that calculates the production order lines from the header .

title : How to Calculate Order Promising Dates
If you specify a requested delivery date on a sales order line , then that date is used as the starting point for the following calculations :
- requested delivery date - shipping time = planned shipment date
- planned shipment date - outbound whse. handling time = shipment date
If the items are available to pick on the shipment date , then the sales process can continue . If the items are not available to be picked on the shipment date , then a stock-out warning is displayed .
- shipment date + outbound whse. handling time = planned shipment date
- planned shipment date + shipping time = planned delivery date
- Capable to Promise ( CTP )
# # # Available to Promise
# # # Capable to Promise
- Calculates the earliest delivery date when the customer has not requested a specific delivery date .
- Verifies if the delivery date requested by the customer or promised to the customer is realistic .
- Shipment Date + Outbound Warehouse Handling Time = Planned Shipment Date
- Planned Shipment Date + Shipping Time = Planned Delivery Date
- Planned Delivery Date - Shipping Time = Planned Shipment Date
- Planned Shipment Date - Outbound Warehouse Handling = Shipment Date
The order processor finishes the CTP process by accepting the dates . This means that a planning line and a reservation entry are created for the item before the calculated dates to ensure that the order is fulfilled .
# # To set up order promising
# # # To enter inbound warehouse handling time in the inventory setup window
If you want to include warehouse handling time in the order promising calculation on the purchase line , you can set it up as a default for the inventory and for your location .

title : Payment Tolerance and Payment Discount Tolerance
# How to : Work with Payment Tolerances and Payment Discount Tolerances
You can set up a payment tolerance to close an invoice when the payment does not fully cover the amount on the invoice . You can set up a payment discount tolerance to grant a payment discount after the payment discount date has passed .
You can use payment discount tolerances so that if you accept a payment discount after the payment discount date , then it is always posted to either the payment discount account or a payment tolerance account .
# # Applying Payment Tolerance to Multiple Documents
A single document has the same payment tolerance whether it is applied on its own or with other documents . Acceptance of a late payment discount when you are applying payment tolerance to multiple documents automatically occurs for each document where the following rule is true :
* payment discount date &lt; payment date on the selected entry &lt; = payment tolerance date *
You can choose to display a warning that is based on different tolerance situations .
For more information , see the &quot; To enable or disable payment tolerance warning &quot; section .

The following table provides an overview of tasks that you typically perform to close a year and period .
The planning system takes all demand and supply data into account , nets the results , and creates suggestions for balancing the supply to meet the demand .
Planning has two elements : demand and supply . These must be held in balance to ensure that the demand is met in a timely and cost-efficient manner .
# # Planning with Manual Transfer Orders
The following planning parameters exist on the item or SKU card :
- Maximum Inventory
- Lot Accumulation Period
The following order modifiers exist on the item or SKU card :
- Minimum Order Quantity
- Maximum Order Quantity
Global planning setup fields on the * * Manufacturing Setup * * window include :
- Dynamic Low-Level Code
- Current Production Forecast
- Use Forecast on Locations
- Blank Overflow Level
- Combined MPS / MRP Calculation
- Components at Location
This specifies whether the supply represented by the production order line is considered by the planning system when calculating action messages .
The emergency warning is displayed in two situations :
- The inventory is negative on the planning starting date .
Any document lines with due dates before the planning starting date are consolidated into one emergency supply order for the item to arrive on the planning starting date .
The exception warning is displayed if the projected available inventory drops below the safety stock quantity .
The planning system will suggest a supply order to meet the demand on its due date . The warning text states the item ’ s safety stock quantity and the date on which it is violated .
Violating the safety stock level is considered an exception because it should not occur if the reorder point has been set correctly .
- The planning starting date is earlier than the work date .
- The planning line suggests to change a released purchase or production order .

title : Multiple Contracts
Depending on your service level agreements with a customer , you may have to handle a service item under more than one service contract .
By handling a service item under multiple contracts , you can do the following :
* Issue different contracts for the same service item .
* Service parts separately .
* Consider different skills that are required to service different aspects of a service item , such as mechanical components and software .
* Specify different response times and frequencies in servicing different parts of a service item .
* Address different kinds of activities to be performed on a service item when the service item requires different types of service in different time periods .
* Select and assign an appropriate contract number to a service item line when you are creating a service order .
* Handle relevant financial information about service items and service level agreements .
# # Creating Multiple Contracts per Service Item
When you add a service item on a contract line that is registered in other service contracts or contract quotes , a warning message is displayed stating that the service item already belongs to one or more service contracts or contract quotes . If you confirm this message , all relevant service item information is copied to a newly created contract line .
# # Creating Service Orders for Multiple Contracts
You can manually create a service order for a service item that is registered in multiple active contracts . A service contract is active when it is signed and not expired .
title : Create and Manage Nonstock Items
# How to : Work with Nonstock Items
* From a nonstock item card , create a new item card based on a template .
A nonstock item typically has the item number of the vendor who supplies it . To enable conversion of a nonstock item card to a normal item card , you must first set up how vendor item numbering is converted to your own item numbering .
# # To create a nonstock item
Nonstock item cards have much less information than normal item cards because you only use them to offer on quotes and in other ways . For that reason , they must be converted to normal item cards before you can post sales transactions for them .
# # To set up how nonstock item numbers are converted to your own numbering
To enable conversion of a nonstock item card to a normal item card , you must first set up how the vendor &apos;s item numbering is converted to your own item number format .

- It must exist in the bin that it was output to .
In addition , existing assembly orders can only be restored if the number of lines and the sequence of lines on the original assembly order are not changed .
# # To undo posting of an assembly order
If the posted assembly order that you want to undo relates to a fully posted assembly order that is now deleted , then you have the option to recreate it , typically because you want to reprocess it .
After goods are received and before goods are shipped , a series of internal warehouse activities take place to ensure an effective flow through the warehouse and to organize and maintain company inventories .
title : About Cost Accounting
Cost accounting can help you understand the costs of running a business . Cost accounting information is designed to analyze :
- What types of costs that you incur when you run a business ?
- Where do the costs occur ?
- Who bears the costs ?
In cost accounting , you allocate actual and budgeted costs of operations , departments , products , and projects to analyze the profitability of your company .
# # Workflow in Cost Accounting
Cost accounting has the following main components :
- Cost types , cost centers , and cost objects
- Cost entries and cost journals
- Cost reporting
The following diagram shows the workflow in cost accounting .
# # Cost Types , Cost Centers , and Cost Objects
You define a chart of cost types with a structure and functionality that resembles the general ledger chart of accounts . You can transfer the general ledger income statement accounts or create your own chart of cost types .
Cost objects are products , product groups , or services of a company . These are the finished goods of a company that carry the costs .
You can link cost centers to departments and cost objects to projects in your company . However , you can link cost centers and cost objects to any dimensions in the general ledger and supplement them with subtotals and titles .
# # Cost Entries and Cost Journals
Operational costs can be transferred from the general ledger . You can automatically transfer the cost entries from the general ledger to cost entries with each posting . You can also use a batch job to transfer the general ledger entries to cost entries based on daily or monthly summary posting .
The allocation base that is used and the accuracy of the allocation definition have an influence on the results of cost allocations . The allocation definition is used to allocate costs first from so-called pre-cost centers to main cost centers and then from cost centers to cost objects .
You can create as many cost budgets as you want . You can copy the cost budget to the general ledger budget and vice versa . You can transfer budgeted costs as actual costs .
title : Review a Test Report Before Posting a Sales or Purchase Document
# How to : View Test Reports Before Posting
&gt; The following procedure is about testing before posting a purchase document . The functionality works in the same way for sales documents .
# # To print a test report before posting a purchase invoice
2 . Open the purchase invoice that you want to test .
All parts of the purchase invoice are tested , and the result is presented in a report . If the report indicates any errors or missing information , then you must correct the problem before posting the purchase invoice .
You cannot change the contents of this window .
title : Execute Production
When demand is planned for and the materials have been issued according to production BOMs , then the actual production operations can start and be executed in the sequence defined by the production order routing .

title : Apply Entries in Different Currencies
# How to : Enable Application of Ledger Entries in Different Currencies
If you purchase from a vendor in one currency and submit payment in another currency , you can apply the payment to the purchase .
Likewise , if you sell to a customer in one currency and receive payment in another currency , you can apply the payment to the sales invoice .
# # To enable application of vendor ledger entries in different currencies
&#124; None &#124; Application between currencies is not allowed . &#124;

title : Date Calculation for Sales
If the customer has requested a specific delivery date , then the date on which the items must be available to pick to meet that delivery date is calculated .
If the customer does not request a specific delivery date , then the date on which the items can be delivered is calculated , starting from the date on which the items are available for picking .
If you specify a requested delivery date on the sales order line , then that date is used as the starting point for the following calculations .
If the items are available to pick on the shipment date , then the sales process can continue .
If the items are not available to be picked on the shipment date , then a stock-out warning is displayed .

title : Design Details - Transfers in Planning
# Design Details : Transfers in Planning
# # Why is Transfer a Special Case ?
A transfer order looks much like any other order in the program . However , behind the scene it is very different .
This means that when the system manipulates the supply side of the transfer , it must make a similar change on the demand side .
# # Transfers are Dependent Demand
The related demand and supply has some resemblance with components of a production order line , but the difference is that components will be on the next planning level and with a different item , whereas the two parts of the transfer is situated on the same level , for the same item .
An important similarity is that just as components are dependent demand , so is the transfer demand . The demand from a transfer line is dictated by the supply side of the transfer in the sense that if the supply is changed , the demand is directly affected .
Unless the planning flexibility is None , a transfer line should never be treated as independent demand in planning .
The following illustration shows what a string of transfers could look like .
In this example , a customer orders the item at location GREEN . Location GREEN is supplied through transfer from the central warehouse RED . The central warehouse RED is supplied by transfer from production on location BLUE .
In this example , the planning system will start at the customer demand and work its way backwards through the chain . The demands and supplies will be processed one location at a time .
# # Transfer Level Code
The sequence in which the locations are processed in the planning system is determined by the transfer level code of the SKU .
To support manual transfers , the planning will analyze existing transfer orders and then plan the order in which the locations should be processed . Internally , the planning system will operate with temporary SKUs carrying transfer level codes .
If more transfers to a given location exist , the first transfer order will define the planning direction . Transfers running in the opposite direction will be canceled .
When changing quantities on existing supply , the planning system takes reservations into account in the sense that the reserved quantity represents the lower limit for how much the supply can be reduced .
When changing the quantity on an existing transfer order line , keep in mind that the lower limit will be defined as the highest reserved quantity of the outbound and inbound transfer line .
# # Changing Quantity in a Transfer Chain
Now the planner at PINK location chooses to reserve against the purchase .
When the planning system runs again , it should get rid of excess supply . However , the reservation will lock the purchase and the transfer to a quantity of 27 .
# # Lead Time Calculation
When calculating the due date of a transfer order different kinds of lead time will be taken into account .
The lead times that are active when planning a transfer order are :
* Outbound Warehouse Handling Time
* Inbound Warehouse Handling Time
* On the planning line , the following fields are used to provide information about the calculation .
* Transfer Shipment Date
The shipment date of the transfer line will be shown in the Transfer Shipment Date field , and the receipt date of the transfer line will be shown in the Due Date field .
The starting and ending dates will be used to describe the actual transportation period .
The following illustration shows the interpretation of the starting date-time and ending date-time on planning lines related to transfer orders .
In this example , it means that :
* Shipment date + Outbound handling = Starting Date
* Ending Date + Inbound Handling = Receipt Date
# # Safety Lead Time
On the production order line , the Ending Date + Safety Lead Time + Inbound Warehouse Handling Time = Due Date .
On the purchase order line , the Planned Receipt Date + Safety Lead Time + Inbound Warehouse Handling Time = Expected Receipt Date .
Therefore , when changing the due date on a transfer line , the lead time must be calculated in order to update the outbound side of the transfer .

# Using Dynamics NAV without Outlook
* DB1 / SL
* DB2 / SL
* Half-Year Convention
&gt; When you use this method , a fixed asset is depreciated by the same amount each year .
When you use the straight-line method , you must specify one of the following options in the fixed asset depreciation book :
* The depreciation period ( years or months ) or a depreciation ending date
* A fixed yearly percentage
* A fixed yearly amount
Remaining depreciation days are calculated as the number of depreciation days minus the number of days between the depreciation starting date and the last fixed asset entry date .
# # # Fixed Yearly Percentage
If you enter a fixed yearly percentage , the program uses the following formula to calculate the depreciation amount :
# # # Fixed Yearly Amount
If you enter a fixed yearly amount , the program uses this formula to calculate the depreciation amount :
# # # Example - Straight-Line Depreciation
For this example , the fixed asset ledger entry looks like this :
* Depreciation starting date
This accelerated depreciation method allocates the largest portion of the cost of an asset to the early years of its useful lifetime . If you use this method , you must enter a fixed yearly percentage .
The following formula calculates depreciation amounts :
The depreciable basis is calculated as the book value less posted depreciation since the starting date of the current fiscal year .
The following table shows how the fixed asset ledger entries look .
The calculation continues until the book value equals the final rounding amount or the salvage value that you entered .
# # # Example - Declining-Balance 2 Depreciation
* ND = Number of depreciation days
The formula for calculating the depreciation amounts is :
The depreciation values are :
You can use various percentages to calculate declining-balance .
The fixed asset ledger entries look like this :
&quot; SL &quot; after the book value means that the straight-line method has been used .
1st year :
The declining-balance amount is used because it is the greater amount .
The straight-line amount is used because it is the greater amount .
The program has a facility that allows you to set up user-defined depreciation methods .
# # # Depreciation Based on Number of Units
# # # To set up user-defined depreciation methods
# # # Example - User-defined Depreciation
You use a depreciation method that allows you to depreciate assets in an accelerated manner for income tax purposes .
You would use the following depreciation rates for a fixed asset with a three-year lifetime for tax purposes :
The acquisition cost is LCY 100,000 , and the depreciable lifetime is five years . Depreciation is calculated annually .
# # # Example - Half-Year Convention Depreciation
# # Example - DB1 / SL Depreciation Using Half-Year Convention
* Straight-line amount = 28,800 / 1.5 = 11,520.00 *
# # Duplicating Entries to More Depreciation Books
&gt; You cannot duplicate in the same journal and journal batch as you are duplicating from . If you post entries in the fixed asset G / L journal , you can duplicate them in the fixed asset journal or in the fixed asset G / L journal using another batch .

# How to : Run Full Planning , MPS or MRP
Proper planning results depend on the set up done on item cards , assembly BOMs , production BOMs , and routings .
# # Methods for Generating a Plan
&gt; The Calculate Regenerative Plan function is the most common process . The Calculate Plan and Carry out Action Messages functions , however , can be used to run the Calculate Net Change Plan process .
&gt; The Get Action Messages Plan function can be run between regenerative and net change planning runs to obtain an immediate view of the effect of schedule changes , but it is not intended as a replacement of full regenerative or net change planning processes .
# # To calculate the planning worksheet
# # To perform action messages
The batch job deletes the lines in the planning worksheet after it has performed the action message . The other lines remain in the planning worksheet until they are either accepted at a later date or else deleted . You can also delete the lines manually .
Action messages are issued by the order tracking system when balance is unattainable in the existing order network . They can be viewed as a suggestion for you to process changes that reestablish equilibrium between supply and demand .
To avoid small , superfluous , or unimportant action messages , the user can establish dampeners , which serve to restrict the generation of action messages to only those changes that exceed the defined quantity or number of days .
In response to any supply / demand imbalances , the following action messages are generated .
title : Design Details - Planning Parameters
# Design Details : Planning Parameters
The way in which the planning system controls item supply is determined by various settings on the item card or SKU , and settings in manufacturing setup . The following table shows how these parameters are used for planning .
# # Define If the Item Will Be Planned
# # Define How Much to Reorder
If the planning system detects the need to reorder , the selected reordering policy is used to determine when and how much to order .
Independent of the reordering policy , the planning system usually follows this logic :
The following reordering policies affect the quantity that is being reordered .
# # Optimize When and How Much to Reorder
# # Modify the Supply Orders
When the quantity of the order proposal has been calculated , one or more of the order modifiers can adjust it . For example , the maximum order quantity is larger than or equal to the minimum order quantity , which is larger than or equal to the order multiple .
The * * Manufacturing Policy * * option defines which additional orders the MRP calculation will propose .

title : Walkthrough - Setting Up and Invoicing Sales Prepayments
# Walkthrough : Setting Up and Invoicing Sales Prepayments
This walkthrough will take you through the following scenarios :
- Setting up prepayments
- Creating an order that requires a prepayment
- Creating a prepayment invoice
- Correcting the prepayment requirements on an order
- Invoicing the final amount on an order with prepayment
Arnie works in the Accounts Receivable department , where he posts invoices and payments .
When the customer calls , Susan negotiates with the customer until they reach an agreement . She can then choose to calculate the prepayment in several different ways .
After Susan sends the prepayment invoice , the customer orders an extra item . Susan updates the order and creates a second prepayment invoice .
Arnie registers the customer &apos;s payment and applies it to the invoices , and then sends the final invoice .
Phyllis sets up the system to handle prepayments for customers .
- Phyllis decides to have the same number series for prepayments as the one used for sales invoicing .
- Phyllis sets the program to check if prepayments are required before final invoicing on an order .
- Phyllis sets up default values for a required prepayment percentage for particular items and customers .
The following procedures describe how to complete Phyllis &apos; tasks :
# # # # To set up number series for prepayments
# # # # To block shipments for unpaid prepayment
Now you cannot ship or invoice an order that has an unpaid prepayment amount .
# # # # To assign default prepayment percentages to customers and items
9 . Close all windows .
# # # # To specify an account for sales prepayments in general posting setup
# # Creating an Order that Requires a Prepayment
Susan creates the prepayment invoice and sends it to the customer .
5 . Accept the overdue balance warning that is displayed .
By default , the prepayment fields on the sales line are hidden , so you must display them .
In this scenario , Susan has been instructed to suggest a total prepayment of 2000 for the order .
The recalculation includes all lines that have a prepayment percentage that is greater than 0 .
Now the customer asks if the prepayment percent can be set to 35 % . Susan &apos;s supervisor approves the change .
14 . Verify that the lines have been updated accordingly .
# # Creating a Prepayment Invoice
After entering the correct prepayment values on the order , Susan creates the prepayment invoice and sends it to the customer .
# # Creating an Additional Prepayment Invoice
# # # # To create an additional prepayment invoice
The customer pays the prepayments amount and Arnie , who works in the accounts department , registers the payment and applies it to the prepayment invoices .
2 . Fill in a journal line with the following information .
5 . Repeat the previous step for the second prepayment .
The amount field has now been filled in with the sum of the two prepayment invoices .
# # Invoicing the Remaining Amount
Now Arnie has been informed that the items on the order have been shipped and that the order is ready for invoicing . Arnie creates the invoice for the order .
# # # # To invoice the remaining amount
1 . Open the sales order .
&gt; Normally , the shipping department would have already posted the shipment .
Arnie can view the history to verify that the sales invoice was created as intended .
title : Design Details - Item Tracking and Reservations
# Design Details : Item Tracking and Reservations
&gt; The Late Binding functionality relates only to items that are set up with specific item tracking , and it applies only to reservations against inventory , not against inbound supply orders .
Reservation of item tracking numbers falls into two categories , as shown in the following table .
The main difference between specific and nonspecific reservation is defined by the existence of serial or lot numbers on the demand side , as shown in the following table .
&gt; On a nonspecific reservation the lot number or serial number field is blank in the reservation entry that points at the demand , such as the sale .
When a user posts an outbound document after picking the wrong serial or lot number , other nonspecific reservations are reshuffled to reflect the actual serial or lot number that is picked . This satisfies the posting engine with a fixed application between supply and demand .
For all supported business scenarios , reshuffling is possible only against positive item ledger entries that carry reservation and serial or lot numbers but without defined serial or lot numbers on the demand side .
The Late Binding functionality supports the following business scenarios :
* Entering a specific serial or lot number on an outbound document with nonspecific reservation of a wrong serial or lot number .
* Reserving a specific serial or lot number .
* Posting an outbound document with nonspecific reservation of a serial or lot number .
# # # Entering Serial or Lot Numbers on an Outbound Document with Wrong Nonspecific Reservation

title : Set Up Special and Alternate Pricing and Discounts for Vendors &apos;
# How to : Record Special Purchase Prices and Discounts
The different price and discount agreements that apply when you buy from different vendors must be defined so that the agreed rules and values are applied to purchase documents that you create for the vendors .
Concerning discounts , you can set up and use two types of purchase discounts :
# # To set up a special purchase price for a vendor
# # To set up a line discount for a vendor
# # To set up an invoice discount for a vendor
When your vendors have informed you which invoice discounts they grant , enter the invoice discount code on the vendor cards and set up the terms for each code .
2 . Open the vendor card for a vendor that will be eligible for invoice discounts .
&gt; Invoice discount codes are represented by existing vendor cards . This enables you to quickly assign invoice discount terms to vendors by picking the name of another vendors who will have the same terms .
Proceed to set up new the purchase invoice discount terms .
8 . Repeat steps 5 through 7 for each currency that the vendor will receive a different invoice discount for .
# # To choose a principle for posting purchase discounts
When you post a purchase invoice that includes one or more discounts , you can choose between two principles for posting discount amounts . You can post discounts separately or you can subtract discounts from invoice discounts .
# # Purchase Invoice Discounts and Service Charges
If you have fixed terms for invoice discounts with any vendors , you can enter them for those vendors . Then the discount will be calculated when you fill in a purchase invoice .
Before you can use invoice discounts with purchases , you must specify the vendors that offer you the discounts .
In addition to a discount percentage , you can link a service charge amount to a specific invoice amount .
You can define the terms of the invoice discount in LCY for domestic vendors and in foreign currency for foreign vendors .
&gt; The following describes how the best price is calculated for sales . The calculation is the same for purchases .
- Does the customer have a price / discount agreement , or does the customer belong to a group that does ?
- Is the item or the item discount group on the line included in any of these price / discount agreements ?
- Is there a minimum quantity requirement in the price / discount agreement that is fulfilled ?
If no special price can be calculated for the item on the line , then either the last direct cost or the unit price from the item card is inserted .

title : Work with Bills of Material to Manage Components
You use bills of materials ( BOMs ) to structure parent items that must be assembled or produced by resources or machine centers from components . An assembly BOM can also be used to sell a parent item as a kit consisting of its components .
# # Assembly BOMs or Production BOMs
Assembly BOMs are described in this topic .
Both assembly orders and production orders may be linked directly to sales orders . However , you can only use assembly orders to customize the end item directly for a customer request with the sales order .
# # To create an assembly BOM
To define a parent item that consists of other items , and potentially of resources required to put the parent together , you must create an assembly BOM .
Assembly BOMs usually contain items but can also contain one or more resources that are required to put the assembly item together .
There are two parts to creating an assembly BOM :
- Setting up a new item
- Defining the BOM structure of the assembly item .
Proceed to enter components or resources on the assembly BOM .
# # To view the components of an assembly item indented according to the BOM structure
# # To replace the assembly item with its components on document lines
The following procedure is based on a sales invoice . The same steps apply to other sales documents and to all purchase documents .
2 . Open a sales invoice that contains a line for an assembly item .
# # To calculate the standard cost of an assembly item
You calculate the unit cost of an assembly item by rolling up the unit cost of each component and resource in the item ’ s assembly BOM .
The unit cost of an assembly BOM always equals the total of the unit costs of its components , including other assembly BOMs , and any resources .

# Design Details : Maximum Qty .
The Maximum Quantity policy is a way to maintain inventory using a reorder point .
Everything regarding the Fixed Reorder Qty. policy also applies to this policy . The only difference is the quantity of the suggested supply . When using the maximum quantity policy , the reorder quantity will be defined dynamically based on the projected inventory level and will therefore usually differ from order to order .
# # Calculated per Time Bucket
# # Combines with Order Modifiers
Depending on the setup , it may be best to combine the Maximum Quantity policy with order modifiers to ensure a minimum order quantity or round it to an integer number of purchase units of measure , or split it into more lots as defined by the maximum order quantity .
title : How to Cross-Dock Items
# How to : Cross-Dock Items
Cross-docking functionality is available to you if you have set up your location to require warehouse receive and put-away processing .
If you have calculated cross-dock quantities , put-away lines to the cross-dock bin for cross-dock calculations are created when you post the receipt . Other put-away lines are created as usual .
The program does not keep separate records about items that have been cross-docked , but registers them as ordinary put-away instructions .
# # To set up the warehouse for cross-docking
&gt; Cross-docking is only possible if your location is set up to require warehouse receive and put-away processing .
# # To cross-dock items without viewing the opportunities
If you have bins , the cross-docked items have been assigned to the default cross-dock bin defined on the location card .
# # To cross-dock items after viewing the opportunities
You want to view the source document lines that are requesting the item before you post the receipt .
# # To view cross-docked items in a shipment or pick worksheet
If you are not using bins , you must remember to check the cross-dock area from time to time , or rely on notifications from receipts that items for production have arrived .

If you have an intercompany partner that is not in the same database as your company , you can receive intercompany transactions from that partner in an .xml file . Then you must import the transactions into your inbox .
The transactions are imported into the inbox and you can now process them .
# # To process incoming intercompany transactions
When your intercompany partners send you intercompany transactions , the transactions end up in your intercompany inbox . You must evaluate each transaction in your inbox and act upon it .
# # To process outgoing intercompany transactions
When you post an intercompany journal or document , or send an intercompany order confirmation , the transactions are sent to your intercompany outbox . In order for them to be sent on to your intercompany partners , you must open the outbox and process them .
Lines that you processed with the * * Return to Inbox * * action will be moved to the inbox where you can then accept them to create documents or journal lines in your company .
# # To recreate intercompany inbox transactions
The following procedure describes to re-create inbox transactions , but the same steps also apply to the outbox .
title : Setting Up Workflow Notifications
You set up different aspects of workflow notifications in the following places :
title : How to Pick for Production in Basic Warehouse Configurations
# How to : Pick for Production or Assembly
&gt; The following important differences exist between inventory picks and inventory movements :
# # To pick components in basic warehouse configurations
# # # Handling Assemble-to-Order Items with Inventory Picks
Inventory pick lines for sales items are created in different ways depending on whether none , some , or all of the sales line quantities are assembled to order .
# # To pick components in advanced warehouse configurations
Warehouse pick documents are now created with pick lines for each component that is required in the internal operation .
title : Apply Payments to Unpaid Sales Documents
# How to : Reconcile Customer Payments Manually From a List of Unpaid Sales Documents
When your customers have made payments to your electronic bank account , you must apply each amount paid to the related sales document and then post the payment to update the customer , general ledger , and bank ledger entries .
# # To set up the payment registration journal
# # To reconcile payments individually
Payments entries are posted to general ledger , bank , and customer accounts . Each payment is applied to the related posted sales document .
# # To reconcile lump payments
&gt; This date must be the same on all lines that will be posted as a lump payment .
If you have agreed on a payment discount with your customer , then the payment amounts can be lower than the invoice amounts if payment occurs before the agreed discount date .
The following procedures explains four different ways to post discounted payments in the * * Payment Registration * * window .
* The payment amount is equal to the remaining discounted amount , and the payment date is before the discount date . You post the payment as is .
* The payment amount is lower than the remaining discounted amount . You post the payment as partial . The document remains open to collect / pay the remaining amount .
* The payment amount is more than the remaining discounted amount . You post the payments as is . Only the remaining amount is posted . The additional amount is credited to the customer .
# # # To process a payment amount that is equal to the discounted amount and where the payment date is before the discount date
# # # To process a payment amount that is equal to the discounted amount but where the payment date is after the discount date
&gt; If you want to make an exception and grant the discount even though the payment is late , follow these steps :
The error message and the red font disappear , and you can proceed to process the discounted payment .
The related document remains open .
# # # To process a payment that is lower than the remaining discounted amount
# # # To process a payment that is more than the remaining discounted amount
The related document is closed , and the customer is credited the excess payment amount .
# # To find a specific sales document that is not fully invoiced
* Document number
* Amount or amount range
The following procedure explains how to find a specific document by using both search criteria .
&gt; The value that you enter in this field is enclosed in hidden wildcard characters . This means that the function searches for all document numbers that contain the entered value .
The Search function searches among documents that are not fully invoiced based on the specified criteria .
Proceed to record an undocumented payment .
You can either post the journal line to update the total on the balancing account . Alternatively , you can leave the journal line unposted , and perhaps append it with a note that the payment needs more analysis .
title : How to Allocate Resources
# How to : Allocate Resources
# # To see an overview of service orders and service quotes
You may often need to see the list of service orders or service quotes that meet certain requirements to be able to perform specific actions with them one by one . For example , you may need to allocate resources to service orders that belong to a specific customer .
# # To allocate a resource using resource or resource group availability
3 . Choose the entry with the service task to which you want to allocate a resource .
7 . Specify a date on which the resource has enough available hours for the task , and which is close to the response date of the service order .
Repeat these steps for each date that you want to allocate the resource to the service task .
# # To allocate a resource using a service order
After you have created and filled in a service order or service quote , you can allocate resources , for example , technicians , to perform service tasks registered as service item lines in the document .
3 . Choose the service item line corresponding to the service task you want to allocate a resource to .
&gt; For a service item in a service order , there can only be active allocation entries with one resource or resource group at a time .
# # To reallocate resources on a service order
You can reallocate resources directly from a service order or service quote when you are working with it . The original entry will still exist , but its status is updated as follows :
2 . Open the relevant service order .
# # To reallocate a resource using the dispatch board
4 . Select the allocation entry with the service task you want to reallocate a resource to .
# # To register resource hours
If the same resource works on all the service items in the service order , you can register the total resource hours for one service item only and then split the resource line to assign the resource hours to the other service items .
# # To assign a resource to all service items in an order
The following procedure shows how to split resource lines in the * * Service Invoice Lines * * window .
Resource lines for the other service items in the order are created with the same resource number as the line you split . The quantity is the quantity for the line you split divided by the number of service items in the order .
# # To cancel an allocation
You can cancel resource allocations for service tasks without reallocating the tasks .
3 . Choose the allocation entry with the service task that you want to cancel allocation for .
title : Dimension Set Entries Overview
The following example shows a dimension set that has three dimension set entries . The dimension set is identified by a dimension set ID , which is 108 .
&#124; Dimension Set ID &#124; Dimension Code &#124; Dimension Value Code &#124; Dimension Value Name &#124;
# # Dimension Set Entries
Dimension sets are stored in the * * Dimension Set Entry * * table as dimension set entries with the same dimension set ID .
By storing dimension sets once in the database , database space is preserved , and overall performance is improved .

title : How to Work with Responsibility Centers
# How to : Work with Responsibility Centers
Using multiple locations together with responsibility centers provides the ability to manage business operations in the most flexible , yet optimal way .
# # To set up a responsibility center
If you are using responsibility centers to administer your company , it can be useful to have a default responsibility center for your company .
&gt; When you enter a responsibility center code on a document , it affects the address , dimensions , and prices on the document .
# # To assign responsibility centers to users
You can set up users so that in their daily routines the program retrieves only the documents relevant for their particular work areas . Users are usually associated with one responsibility center and work only with documents related to specific application areas at that particular center .
To set this up , you assign responsibility centers to users in three functional areas : Purchases , Sales , and Service Management .
title : Create a Sales Order Linked to a Purchase Order for a Direct Shipment
# How to : Make Drop Shipments
A drop shipment is the shipment of items from one of your vendors directly to one of your customers .
# # To create a sales order for drop shipment
To prepare a drop shipment , you create a sales order for an item as normal , except you must indicate on the sales line that the sale requires drop shipment .
# # To create the purchase order for drop shipment
To prepare a drop shipment for the item to be sold , you create a purchase order as normal , except you must indicate on the purchase order that it must be shipped to your customer , not to yourself .
The line information from the sales order is inserted on the purchase order line ( s ) .
You can now instruct the vendor to ship the items to your customer , for example , by mailing the purchase order as a PDF .
# # To view the linked purchase order from the sales order
# # To post a drop shipment
2 . Open the sales order that you created in the &quot; To create a sales order for a drop shipment &quot; section .

title : Date Calculation for Purchases
If you do not specify a requested receipt date , then the order date on the line is used as the starting point for calculating the date on which you can expect to receive the items and the date on which the items are available for picking .
# # Calculating with a Requested Receipt Date
If there is a requested receipt date on the purchase order line , then that date is used as the starting point for the following calculations .
- requested receipt date - lead time calculation = order date
- requested receipt date + inbound whse. handling time + safety lead time = expected receipt date
If you entered a requested receipt date on the purchase order header , then that date is copied to the corresponding field on all the lines . You can change this date on any of the lines , or you can remove the date on the line .
# # Calculating without a Requested Delivery Date
- order date + lead time calculation = planned receipt date
- planned receipt date + inbound whse. handling time + safety lead time = expected receipt date
If you change the order date on the line , such as when items are not available at your vendor until a later date , then the relevant dates on the line are automatically recalculated .

# Design Details : Item Tracking
title : How to Use Item Families in Manufacturing
A production family is a group of individual items whose relationship is based on the similarity of their manufacturing processes . By forming production families , some items can be manufactured twice or more in one production , which will optimize material consumption .
In punching processes , four pieces of the same item can be produced from one sheet and 10 pieces of another , different , item at the same time . The punching machine will punch all 14 pieces in one step .
Forming production families reduces the scrap quantity because what would normally be leftover scrap , when producing big pieces , will be used instead to produce small items .

title : Design Details - Assembly Order Posting
# Design Details : Assembly Order Posting
The following journal postings occur during assembly order posting :
- The item journal posts positive item ledger entries , representing output of the assembly item , from the assembly order header
- The resource journal posts usage of assembly resources ( time units ) , from the assembly order lines .
- The capacity journal posts value entries relating to the resource usage , from the assembly order lines .
The following diagram shows the structure of item and resource ledger entries that result from assembly order posting .
&gt; Machine and work centers are included to illustrate that capacity ledger entries are created from both production and assembly .
The following diagram shows how assembly data flows into ledger entries during posting :
The posting of an assembly order occurs in the following order :
1 . The assembly order lines are posted .
2 . The assembly order header is posted .
The following table outlines the sequence of actions .
&gt; Unlike for production output , which is posted at expected cost , assembly output is posted at actual cost .
# # # Detecting the Adjustment
The order Level detection function is used in conversion scenarios , production and assembly . The function works as follows :
- Cost adjustment is detected by marking the order whenever a material / resource is posted as consumed / used .
- Cost is forwarding by applying the costs from material / resource to the output entries associated with the same order .
The following graphic shows the adjustment entry structure and how assembly costs are adjusted .
# # # Performing the Adjustment
This is enabled by the following data structure .
In addition , posting group fields on the assembly order header and assembly order lines are populated by default as follows .
&#124; Assembly Order Header &#124; Item &#124; Inventory Posting Group &#124; Gen. Prod . Posting Group &#124;

# How to : Pick and Put Away Without a Source Document
After items have been put away and before they are picked to fulfill the needs of a production order or shipment , they are stored in the warehouse as part of available inventory .
&gt; If you are not using internal picks and internal put-aways , these adjustments can be performed using the methods to move items from bin to bin or to post quantity adjustments in a bin .
# # To create an internal pick

title : Design Details - Warehouse Setup
# Design Details : Warehouse Setup
The following warehouse-related granules exist :
- Internal Picks and Put-aways ( 4630 )
# # Bin and Bin Content
A bin content can be given a property of Fixed , Dedicated , or Default to define how the bin content can be used . Bins with none of these properties are referred to as floating bins .
There can only be one default bin per item per location .
In WMS installations , you can restrict the warehouse activities that are allowed for a bin by assigning a bin type to it . The following bin types exist :
&#124; RECEIVE &#124; Items posted as received but not yet put away . &#124;
&#124; SHIP &#124; Items picked for warehouse shipment lines but not yet posted as shipped . &#124;
In advanced warehousing , you can automate and optimize how items are collected in put-away and pick worksheets by ranking bins so that items are suggested taken or placed according to rank criteria to use warehouse space optimally .
Put-away processes are optimized according to bin ranking by suggesting higher-ranking bins before lower-ranking bins . Similarly , pick processes are optimized by first suggesting items from bin content with high bin ranking . Furthermore , bin replenishments are suggested from lower-ranking bins to higher-ranking bins .
Bin ranking together with bin content information are the basic properties that allow users to slot items in the warehouse .
In advanced warehousing , bins can be set up with capacity values , such as quantity , total cubage , and weight to control which and how items are stored in the bin .
Before you set capacity restrictions for bin contents on a bin , you must first make sure that the UOM and dimensions of the item have been set up on the item card .
In advanced warehousing , bins can be grouped in zones to manage how the workflow of warehouse activities is directed .
A zone could be a receiving zone or a stocking zone , and each zone can consist of one or several bins .
Most properties assigned to a zone will by default be assigned to the bin that is created from that zone .
When you work with warehouse classes and a default receiving / shipping bin , you must manually fill in the appropriate bins in the warehouse receipt and shipment lines .
In inbound flows , the class code is only highlighted on inbound lines where the item class code does not match the default receiving bin . If the correct default bins are not assigned , then the quantity cannot be received .

- Print the report to be used when counting .
- Enter and post the actual counted inventory .
# # # To calculate the expected inventory in basic warehouse configurations
# # # To calculate the expected inventory in advanced warehouse configurations
3 . Fill in the batch job request window with the numbers of the items you want to count and with your location .
If you do not do this before you perform the warehouse physical inventory , the results you post to the physical inventory journal and item ledger in the second part of the process will be the physical inventory results combined with other warehouse adjustments for the items that were counted .
9 . Open the report request page and print the lists on which you want employees to record the quantity of items that they count in each bin .
When you register the journal , the program creates two warehouse entries in the warehouse register for every line that was counted and registered :
# # # To print the report to be used when counting
Employees can now proceed to count inventory and record any discrepancies on the printed report .
# # # To enter and post the actual counted inventory in basic warehouse configurations
The related fields are updated accordingly .

title : How to Create Routings
# How to : Create Routings
Manufacturing companies use routings to visualize and direct the manufacturing process .
The routing is the basis of process scheduling , capacity scheduling , scheduled assignment of material needs , and manufacturing documents .
# # To create a routing
Proceed to fill in the routing lines .
&gt; Setup time is calculated per production order , whereas run time is calculated per produced item .
# # To create routing links
Another important benefit is that linked components and operations are displayed in a logical process structure when you use the * * Production Journal * * window for output and consumption posting .
2 . Open the routing that contains the operations that you want to link .
4 . Proceed to add different routing link codes to other operations in the routing , if relevant .
&gt; You should not use the same routing link code in different operations on a routing because you may incorrectly link a component to two different operations , so that it is consumed two times .
&gt; It is a good idea to name the routing link code after the operation in order to ensure operation-specific routing links .
Routing link codes are now assigned to operations . Next , you must create the actual link by assigning the same codes to specific components in the relevant production BOM .
9 . Proceed to add routing link codes to other components according to the unique operations where they are used .
# # To assign personnel , tools , and quality measures to routing operations .
# # To create a new versions of a routing
The version principle enables you to manage several versions of a routing . The structure of the routing version corresponds to the structure of the routing consisting of the routing version header and the routing version lines . The basic difference is defined by the starting date .

title : Planning With or Without Locations
# Planning With or Without Locations
Concerning planning with or without location codes on demand lines , the planning system operates in a straight forward way when :
- demand lines always carry location codes and the system fully uses stockkeeping units , including the relevant location setup .
However , if demand lines sometimes have location codes and other times do not , the planning system will follow certain rules depending on setup .
When the planning system detects demand at a location ( a line with a location code ) , it will behave in different ways depending on 3 critical setup values .
During a planning run , the system checks for the 3 setup values in sequence and plans accordingly :
If yes , then :
2 . Does SKU exist for the item ?
The item is planned according to planning parameters on the SKU card .
If no , then :
The item is planned according to planning parameters on the item card .
&gt; This minimal alternative only covers the exact demand . Any planning parameters defined are ignored .
See variations in the scenarios below .
# # Demand at &quot; Blank Location &quot;
See variations in the setup scenarios below .
# # # Setup 1 :
- SKU is set up for * RED *
- Component at Location = * BLUE *
The item is planned according to planning parameters on the SKU card ( including possible transfer ) .
The item is not planned because no location is defined on the demand line .
# # # Setup 2 :
- No SKU exists
# # # Setup 4 :
- Component at Location = * BLANK *
Therefore , if you often plan for demand at locations , it is strongly advised to use the Stockkeeping Units feature .

title : How to Set Up Bin Types
# How to : Set Up Bin Types
You can direct the flow of items through bins that you have defined for particular warehouse activities . You give each bin its basic flow activities , and thereby define the way the way a bin is used , by assigning it a bin type .
# # To set up the bin types you want to use
3 . Select the activities that can be performed with each bin type .
&gt; Bin types are only applicable if you are using directed put-away and pick for your location .
The bin type determines only how a bin is used when processing the flow of items through the warehouse . You can always override the suggestions for any warehouse document , and you can move items in or out of any bin by performing a warehouse movement .
The bin types that you can create are listed below .

title : Design Details - Staying Under the Overflow Level
# Design Details : Staying under the Overflow Level
# # Calculating the Overflow Level
The overflow level is calculated in different ways depending on planning setup .
# # # Maximum Qty. reordering policy
Overflow level = Maximum Inventory
&gt; If a minimum order quantity exists , then it will be added as follows : Overflow level = Maximum Inventory + Minimum Order Quantity .
# # # Fixed Reorder Qty. reordering policy
Overflow level = Reorder Quantity + Reorder Point
&gt; If the minimum order quantity is higher than the reorder point , then it will replace as follows : Overflow Level = Reorder Quantity + Minimum Order Quantity
If an order multiple exists , then it will adjust the overflow level for both Maximum Qty. and Fixed Reorder Qty. reordering policies .
# # Creating the Planning Line with Overflow Warning
# # # Calculating the Planning Line Quantity
Planning Line Quantity = Current Supply Quantity – ( Projected Inventory – Overflow Level )
&gt; As with all warning lines , any maximum / minimum order quantity or order multiple will be ignored .
# # # Defining the Action Message Type
- If the planning line quantity is higher than 0 , then the action message is Change Qty .
- If the planning line quantity is equal to or lower than 0 , then the action message is Cancel
In case of overflow , the * * Untracked Planning Elements * * window displays a warning message with the following information :
- The projected inventory level that triggered the warning
- The calculated overflow level
- The due date of the supply event .
Example : “ The projected inventory 120 is higher than the overflow level 60 on 28-01-11 ”
&#124; Reordering Policy &#124; Maximum Qty . &#124;
# # # Situation before sales decrease
&#124; Event &#124; Change Qty . &#124; Projected Inventory &#124;
# # # Situation after sales decrease
&#124; Change &#124; Change Qty . &#124; Projected Inventory &#124;
# # # Resulting Planning Lines
&gt; Without the Overflow feature , no warning is created if the projected inventory level is above maximum inventory . This could cause a superfluous supply of 30 .
title : Design Details - Fixed Reorder Qty .
# Design Details : Fixed Reorder Qty .
The bucketed reorder point concept reduces the number of supply suggestions . This reflects a manual process of frequently walking through the warehouse to check the actual contents in the various bins .
# # Creates only Necessary Supply
Before suggesting a new supply order to meet a reorder point , the planning system checks if supply has already been ordered to be received within the item ’ s lead time . If an existing supply order will solve the problem by bringing the projected inventory to or above the reorder point within the lead time , the system will not suggest a new supply order .

- Quality Controller
- To create new items and several business transactions by following the &quot; Prepare Sample Data &quot; section , later in this walkthrough .
- Which lot of racing frames was faulty .
- On which purchase order the faulty lot was received .
You must create the following new items :
- 1002 , Racing Bike : serial number-specific tracking
Then you must create various purchase , production , and sales transactions with the two items .
# # # To create the items
4 . All other fields have acceptable default data or do not have to be filled in .
Next , define the item &apos;s manufacturing setup .
# # # To purchase components
Next , purchase racing frames from Coolwood Technologies .
Next , produce two racing bikes , SN1 and SN2 .
# # # To produce end items
3 . Create a new released production order by filling in the following fields .
Next , post consumption of racing frames from LOT1 .
Next , produce two more racing bikes , SN3 and SN4 .
13 . Create a new released production order by filling in the following fields on the header .
Next , post more consumption of racing frames from LOT1 .
20 . Close the production journal and the production orders .
Next , sell racing bikes . First sell the racing bike with SN1 to Selangorian Ltd ..
# # # To sell the end items
Next , sell the racing bike with SN2 to The Cannon Group PLC .
Finally , sell some racing frames separately . The Cannon Group PLC. also orders four separate racing frames for their own assembly line .
&gt; Do not post the last sales order for five racing frames .
This completes the preparation of data to demonstrate the Item Tracing and Navigate features .
# # Tracing from Usage to Origin
# # # To determine which lot included the faulty frame and who supplied it
Note that one sales shipment header matches the search criteria . Before you continue the trace , verify that the shipment is the one that shipped the faulty racing bike to Selangorian Ltd .
6 . Choose the + icon on the trace lines to gradually expand and trace backward in the chain of transactions that the sales shipment originates from .
You can trace the following transaction history :
- The first posted document backward in the chain of transactions is the output posting of SN1 from the first released production order .
- The next posted document backward after that is the consumption posting from the first released production order . Here the quality controller sees that a racing frame from LOT1 was used .
- The lowest posted document in this chain is the posted purchase receipt on which racing frames with LOT1 entered inventory .
&gt; Do not make any additional modifications to the trace result , as you will use it in the next section .
# # Tracing from Origin to Usage
The quality controller has established that the faulty racing frames came from LOT1 . He must now find any other racing bikes that contain racing frames from the faulty lot so that those bikes can be stopped or recalled .
# # # To find all usage of the faulty lot
To obtain an overview of all usage of item 2000 with LOT1 , continue to expand all trace lines .
The quality controller immediately informs the sales department so that they can initiate a recall of the defective racing bike from the customer , Cannon Group PLC .

title : Design Details - Monitoring the Projected Inventory Level and the Reorder Point
Inventory is a type of supply , but for inventory planning , the planning system distinguishes between two inventory levels :
* Projected inventory
* Projected available inventory
The projected inventory is used by the planning system to monitor the reorder point and to determine the reorder quantity when using the Maximum Qty. reordering policy .
The projected available inventory is the part of the projected inventory that at a given point in time is available to fulfill demand . The projected available inventory is used by the planning engine when monitoring the safety stock level .
The projected available inventory is used by the planning system to monitor the safety stock level , since the safety stock must always be available to serve unexpected demand .
Having a tight control of the projected inventory is crucial to detect when the reorder point is reached or crossed and to calculate the right order quantity when using the Maximum Qty. reordering policy .
# # Determining the Projected Inventory Level
The following sequence describes how the projected inventory level is determined :
* When a supply event , such as a purchase order has been totally planned , it will increase the projected inventory on its due date .
* When a subsequent supply event is planned and placed on the time line , the posted decrease reminders are investigated one by one up until the planned date of the supply while updating the projected inventory . During this process , the reorder point level of the internal increase reminder may be reached or crossed .
The following shows a graphical illustration of this principle :
In case of B , the reorder point is reached and a new order is created .
title : Assign Item Charges to Sales and Purchases
# How to : Use Item Charges to Account for Additional Trade Costs
In addition to recording the added cost in you inventory value , you can use the Item Charges feature for the following :
- Identify the landed cost of an item for making more accurate decisions on how to optimize the distribution network .
- Break down the unit cost or unit price of an item for analysis purposes .
- include purchase allowances into the unit cost and sales allowances into the unit price .
- On the document where the items that the item charge relates to are listed . This you typically do for documents that are not yet fully posted .
- On a separate invoice by linking the item charge to a posted receipt or shipment where the items that the item charge relate to are listed .
# # To set up item charge numbers
You use item charge numbers to distinguish between the different kinds of item charges that are used in your company .
# # To assign an item charge directly to the purchase invoice for the item
If you know the item charge at the time when you post a purchase invoice for the item , follow this procedure .
3 . Make sure the purchase invoice has one or more lines of type Item .
10 . If there are more than one invoice lines of type Item , choose one of the four distribution options .
The item charge is now assigned to the purchase invoice . When you post the receipt of the purchase invoice , the items &apos; inventory values are updated with the cost of the item charge .
# # To assign an item charge from a separate invoice to the purchase invoice for the item
If you received an invoice for the item charge after you posted the original purchase receipt , follow this procedure .
The item charge on the separate purchase invoice is now assigned to the item on the posted purchase receipt , thereby updating the item &apos;s inventory value with the cost of the item charge .

The old architecture had the following features :
* There was extensive use of global variables , which increased the possibility of hidden errors due to use of variables with the wrong scope .
* Several procedures that were only used locally and were only meant to be used locally were not marked as local .
* Most procedures had no parameters and used global variables . Some used parameters and overrode global variables with locals .
* Code patterns for searching the general ledger accounts and creating general ledger and VAT entries was not standardized and varied from place to place . In addition , there was a lot of code duplication and broken symmetry between customer and vendor code .
* Standardized patterns for the search of general ledger accounts have been implemented by using helper functions from Posting Group tables .
* A Posting Engine Framework has been implemented to manage the start and finish of transactions and to isolate the creation to general ledger and VAT entries , the collection of VAT adjustment , and the calculation of additional currency amounts .
* Many helper functions have been transferred to corresponding customer and vendor ledger entry tables .
* The use of global variables has been minimized , so that each procedure uses parameters and encapsulates its own application logic .

# # To create new account schedules
You use account schedules to analyze figures in general ledger accounts or to compare general ledger entries with general ledger budget entries . For example , you can view the general ledger entries as percentages of the budget entries .
When you have created a new account schedule and set up the rows , you must set up columns . You can either set them up manually or assign a predefined column layout to your account schedule .
&gt; If you did not assign a default column layout to the account schedule , you must set the columns up manually .
# # # To create a column that calculates percentages
4 . Insert a line immediately above the first row for which you want to display a percentage .
# # To set up account schedules with overviews
You can use an account schedule to create a statement comparing general ledger figures and general leger budget figures .
The accounts are now inserted into your account schedule . If you want you can also change the column layout .
Now you can copy and paste your budget statement into a spreadsheet .

* How you record costs and other values in the general ledger .
title : Understanding Assemble to Order and Assemble to Stock
# Understanding Assemble to Order and Assemble to Stock
Assembly items can be supplied in the following two processes :
You typically use * assemble to order * for items that you do not want to stock because you expect to customize them to customer requests or because you want to minimize the inventory carrying cost . The supporting functionality includes :
- Ability to customize assembly items when taking a sales order .
- Overview of availability of the assembly item and its components .
- Ability to reserve assembly components immediately to guarantee order fulfillment .
- Function to determine profitability of the customized order by rolling up price and cost .
- Integration to the warehouse to make assembly and shipping easier .
- Ability to assemble to order at the point of making a sales quote or a blanket sales order .
- Ability to combine inventory quantities with assemble-to-order quantities .
A general principle in Assembly Management is that when combined on a sales order line , assemble-to-order quantities must be shipped before inventory quantities .
An example why you would want to modify the quantity to assemble is that you want to partially post shipment of inventory quantities before the assembly output can be shipped .
&#124; &#124; Sales Order Line &#124; Assembly Order Hheader &#124;
- The maximum quantity that you can enter is 4 . This is to ensure that you do not assemble more of this assemble-to-order item than what is needed on the sale .

title : Revalue Fixed Assets
# How to : Revalue Fixed Assets
Revaluation of fixed assets can consist of appreciations , write-downs , or general value adjustments .
When the value of a fixed asset has decreased , you post a journal line with a lower amount , a write-down , to the depreciation book . The new amount is recorded as a write-down according to the fixed asset posting setup .
# # To post an appreciation from the fixed asset G / L journal
# # To post a write-down from the fixed asset G / L journal
# # To perform general revaluation of fixed assets
&gt; If the index figures are for simulation purposes only , you can create a special depreciation book to store them in . Then these entries will not affect any of the other depreciation books .
# # To post additional acquisition costs
The depreciation percentage is calculated as :
# # # Example - Posting Additional Acquisition Costs
A machine is purchased on August 1 , 2000 . The acquisition cost is 4,800 . The depreciation method is straight-line over four years .
On September 15 , 2000 , an invoice is posted for painting the machine . The invoice amount is 480 .
15 days of depreciation ( from 09 / 01 / 00 to 09 / 15 / 00 ) is calculated as :
title : Design Details - Loading the Inventory Profiles
# Design Details : Loading the Inventory Profiles
To sort out the many sources of demand and supply , the planning system organizes them on two timelines called inventory profiles .
- Released production orders where consumption or output has been posted .
- Assembly orders where consumption or output has been posted .
- Transfer orders where shipment has been posted .
- Purchase orders where receipt has been posted .
Apart from loading demand and supply types , certain types are loaded with attention to special rules and dependencies that are described in the following .
# # Serial / Lot Numbers are Loaded by Specification Level
Attributes in the form of serial / lot numbers are loaded into the inventory profiles along with the demand and supply that they are assigned to .
Another reason that serial / lot numbered supply is inflexible is that serial / lot numbers are generally assigned so late in the process that it would be confusing if changes are suggested .
# # Order-to-Order Links are Never Broken
# # Component Need is Loaded according to Production Order Changes
The safety stock quantity is primarily a demand type and is therefore loaded into the inventory profile on the planning starting date .
# # Forecast Demand is Reduced by Sales Orders
The production forecast expresses anticipated future demand . While actual demand is entered , typically as sales orders for produced items , it consumes the forecast .
A user is required to define a valid forecast period . The date on the forecasted quantity defines the start of the period , and the date on the next forecast defines the end of the period .
The forecast for periods prior to the planning period is not used , regardless of whether it was consumed or not . The first forecast figure of interest is either the date on or the closest date prior to the planning starting date .
# # Blanket Order Demand is Reduced by Sales Orders
The planning calculation considers open sales orders linked to the specific blanket order line , but it does not consider any valid time period . Nor does it consider posted orders , since the posting procedure has already reduced the outstanding blanket order quantity .
title : Set Up Resource Costs , Prices , and Capacity
# How to : Set Up Resources
When resources are used or sold in a job , the prices and costs associated with them are retrieved from the information that you set up .
You specify the default amount per hour when the resource is created . For example , if you use a specific machine on a job for five hours , the job would be calculated based on the amount per hour .
# # To set up a resource

The execution unit , level in the execution unit , and sequence of an entity help control the order that the data is exported or imported in .
- Entities in different execution units are processed in parallel .
- In each execution unit , entities are processed in parallel if they have the same level .
- In each level , entities are processed according to their sequence number in that level .
- After one level has been processed , the next level is processed .
You might want to resequence your entities in the following situations :
Use can use the * * Sort by * * option to view the entity list in sequential order .
For import projects , you can choose to truncate records in the entities prior to import . This is useful if your records must be imported into a clean set of tables . This setting is off by default .
# # Validate that the source data and target data are mapped correctly
Mapping is a function that applies to both import and export jobs .
# # Verify the security for your import or export job
A job can be secured by roles , users , and legal entity at the same time .
# # Run the import or export job
The job history is available for troubleshooting and investigation on both import and export jobs . Historical job runs are organized by time ranges .
Each job run provides the following details :
- Execution details
Execution details show the state of each data entity that the job processed . Therefore , you can quickly find the following information :
- Which entities were processed
- For an entity , how many records were successfully processed , and how many failed

title : Absence registration in Time and attendance
# Absence registration in Time and attendance
This topic describes the concepts for absence and explains how to handle absence in Time and attendance .
# # Absence that is based on regular work hours
Workers are considered absent for any hours that they don &apos;t work during their regular work hours . Regular work hours are defined in a worker &apos;s standard time profile .
For example , a worker is working on a day profile that has clock-in at 7 : 00 AM and clock-out at 3 : 00 PM . If the worker clocks in at 9 : 00 AM , he is considered absent from 7 : 00 AM to 9 : 00 AM on that day .
In this case , workers are prompted to enter a reason for their absence . They can specify a reason by selecting an absence code .
Various rules can be applied to absence codes . For example , an absence code can be configured to deduct or grant pay .
You can set up automatic absence codes . These absence codes can be used to calculate a worker &apos;s time when no absence is registered . The worker &apos;s time profile determines whether the absence code for standard time or flex time is used .
# # # Set up standard time and flex time
# # # Set up planned absence
# # # Set up a planned absence for interruption
# # Examples of the use of absence in a flex profile
The following three examples show how absence is calculated in a profile that has flex periods .
The examples use the following profile .
# # # Example 2 : Signing out in during Standard time period
# # Absence in the calculation and approval process
Worker time registrations must be calculated and approved before they can be transferred to a payroll system as pay items .

This topic describes the various elements that make up a workflow .
A workflow consists of elements . The sections that follow describe each type of element .
A * task * is a unit of work that must be performed . Two types of tasks can be added to a workflow : manual tasks and automated tasks .
- Call an employee &apos;s manager .
- Perform a credit check .
- Create a customer record for the customer , if a record doesn &apos;t already exist .
- Approve the document .
- Reject the document .
- Request a change to the document .
- Assign the document to another user for approval .
In this scenario , you might want to create the following line-item workflows :
The following elements let you design workflows that have alternate branches or branches that run at the same time .

title : Improvements to statement posting functionality
Finance and Operations includes the following validations that are related to these configuration keys :
- Both configuration keys can &apos;t be turned on at the same time .
The following sections describe some of the major improvements for the statement posting feature that appear in the user interface for retail statements and posted statements .
A new state model has been introduced in the statement posting routine across the calculation and posting processes .
The following table describes the various states and their order during the calculation process .
- The user has complete visibility into the state where the error occurred .
- The first section shows the current status of the statement , together with the error code and a detailed error message , if an error occurred .
Additionally , the header of the second and third sections shows the overall status of the relevant process .
The * * Sales order detail * * tab of an aggregated transaction shows the following information :
The aggregated transaction view provides the following benefits :
- The user has visibility into the aggregated transactions that failed during sales order creation and the sales orders that failed during invoicing .
- The user has visibility into how transactions are aggregated .
- The user has a complete audit trail , from retail transactions , to sales orders , to sales invoices . This audit trail wasn &apos;t available in the legacy statement posting feature .
- Aggregated XML file make it easier to identify issues during sales order creation and invoicing .
Currently , the program shows this data only for posted statements .
Other , back-end improvements that users can see have been made to the statement posting feature . Here are some examples :
- The occurrence of deadlock on retail transaction tables is reduced by introducing additional extension tables and by doing insert operations instead of update operations on the retail transaction tables .
- Statements are efficiently queued for processing by prioritizing the statements that have the maximum number of transactions .
# # General guidance about the statement posting process
- We recommend that you use aggregation while you calculate and post statements . Therefore , the following settings are recommended for some of the aggregation parameters :

title : Vendor invoice automation
This topic explains the features that are available for end-to-end automation of vendor invoices , even invoices that include attachments .
The solution footprint consists of the following components :
+ Data entities for the invoice header , invoice lines , and invoice attachments
+ Exception processing for invoices
+ A side-by-side attachment viewer in invoices
The rest of this topic provides detailed descriptions of these solution components .
Vendor invoice document attachment is a new data entity that is introduced as part of this feature . The Vendor invoice header entity has been modified so that it supports attachments . The Vendor invoice line entity hasn ’ t been modified for this feature .
To quickly generate test data that includes invoices and attachments , follow these steps .
1 . Create invoices that have lines and attachments .
&gt; The attachments must be header attachments . Currently , the Vendor invoice document attachment entity doesn ’ t support line attachments .
1 . Create an export job that includes the Vendor invoice header , Vendor invoice line , and Vendor invoice document attachment entities .
# # # Determining the legal entity for an invoice
Invoices that are imported via data packages can be associated with the legal entity that they belong to in two ways :
&gt; This behavior is standard data management behavior . It ’ s explained here , in the context of invoices , just for the sake of completeness .
# # # Exceptions list page
This list page includes the following fields that come in via the feed :
&gt; The line reference isn ’ t the invoice ID .
This list page also has a preview pane that you can used in the following ways :
+ View the whole list of attachments for the invoice , if any attachments came with the invoice .
The list page supports the following actions :
# # # Exception details page
The exception details page supports the following operation :
# # # Shared service vs. organization-based exception processing
+ By user role
+ By user
If security is configured for the invoice import job , the exceptions list page honors those settings . Users will be able to see only the invoice exception records that this setup allows them to see .
To help you easily view the attachments for vendor invoices , the following pages that are used in the invoicing process now provide an attachment viewer :
Here is the main functionality that the attachment viewer provides :
+ View multi-page TIFF files .
+ Perform the following actions on image files :
+ Highlight parts of the image .
+ Block parts of the image .
+ Add annotations to the image .
+ Zoom in and out on the image .
+ Pan the image .
+ Undo and redo actions .
+ Fit the image to size .
# # # Show / hide invoice attachments
The following actions in the attachment viewer are controlled via role-based security :
# # # Pending vendor invoices page
The following privileges provide ready-only access or read / write access to the attachment viewer for the highlighting , block , and annotation actions :
The following duties provide read-only access or read / write access to the attachment viewer for those actions :

title : Quality management processes
This article provides information about the quality management process for nonconforming products . It describes how you can use quality control functionality , how to define and maintain nonconformances , and how to handle corrections .
# # Controlling the quality management process
Here are some of the ways that you can control the quality management process :
- Create quality orders that are based on trigger points such as “ at product receipt ” for inbound operations or “ at product pick-up ” for outbound operations .
- Document test results , and determine whether the results meet the established test criteria and acceptable quality levels .
- Use document management for detailed product specifications and user-specific notes as part of reporting during the inspection process .
- Schedule error correction processes by using correction handling that is linked to quality orders .
# # Product testing and quality orders
Product testing is typically referred to as quality control and uses quality orders . By using the quality control functionality , you can do the following :
- Record the test results in a quality order , validate the test results against the AQL , and print a certificate of analysis that displays the test results .
The following table lists the six default nonconformance types and describes the information that must be recorded for each type .
&#124; Nonconformance type &#124; Source information &#124;
&#124; Co-product production &#124; A co-product production order nonconformance that is related to batch production orders . &#124;
You can optionally link one nonconformance to another and create a new nonconformance from an existing one . For example , the link can reflect the interconnection between quality problems .

title : Movement of inventory with associated work in Warehouse management
The flexibility to manage the daily operations of warehouse workers can be useful in scenarios such as these :
A company has a relatively small receiving area , and it ’ s congested with pallets and boxes awaiting put away . A large shipment is expected on the current day , so the receiving clerk decides to clear up the receiving area by moving some of the pallets to a secondary inbound staging area .
An experienced warehouse worker notices an opportunity in a warehouse to consolidate items in one location instead of having them divided across 3 nearby locations with little quantity on each . The worker wants to consolidate the quantity by moving items from each of these locations into the same location and onto the same license plate .
Only the ad hoc movement is currently supported . That means that you will not be able to move reserved inventory through the movement by template mobile device menu items .

title : Immediate replenishment
Immediate replenishment lets you replenish inventory immediately after a location directive line fails to allocate inventory . The replenishment is based on a single line in the setup of the location directive . If inventory isn &apos;t on hand in the unit of measure that is specified by that line , replenishment of that unit of measure occurs immediately .
Immediate replenishment provides an alternative to the method where the allocation of inventory is based on more lines in the location directive , and where the demand is summed at the end of the allocation and replenished in the unit of measure that is specified by the last line in the location directive .
The benefits of using immediate replenishment are that replenishment can be limited by specific units and the quantity can be directed to specific locations .
Immediate replenishment is used during wave execution if allocation fails for a location directive line that a replenishment template is set for .
# # Set up immediate replenishment
- Make sure that there is enough on-hand inventory at the locations where the demand replenishment template searches for on-hand inventory for replenishment .

title : Packing slip updates for returns
The packing slip update can be processed in either the item arrival journal or the return order .
As part of the process for posting packing slips , the packing slip reference number from the customer ’ s shipping documents can be associated with the order lines . This association is optional and for reference only . It does not create any transactional updates .
If not all of the expected return items have arrived , you should include only the quantity that has been received in the packing slip update . Leave the remaining items on the order until the rest of the return shipment has arrived .
If an item is sent back from quarantine to the Shipping and Receiving department , such as when the quarantine inspector does not know where to store the item in inventory , the corresponding packing slip must be updated to correctly register and act on the disposition code that is specified as a result of the quarantine .
When you update a packing slip for a returned item that is from a sales agreement , the sales agreement commitment for that item is automatically updated to reflect the change in the quantity or the amount .

# # Set up contact information for a customer
This article provides information about purchasing policies . A purchasing policy is a collection of rules that control the requisition process . Purchasing policies help procurement administrators implement their procurement strategy by creating a policy structure that is aligned with the organization ’ s strategic purchasing requirements .
# # Determining which rule to apply
Depending on how you configure your purchasing policies , multiple rules can affect the users in an organization . The following examples illustrate different ways that you can configure purchasing policies and specify how policies are applied when a transaction occurs .
# # # Example 1 : Simple purchasing policy configuration
Organizations that are small and less complex can set up purchasing policies by legal entity , and can use only the Companies organization hierarchy .
When an employee in legal entity 2222 creates a purchase requisition , the policy rules are derived from policy B .
# # # Example 2 : Complex purchasing policy configuration
In the previous example , all purchasing rules were defined in a single organization hierarchy , the Companies organization hierarchy . However , a complex organization might define policies for multiple organization hierarchies .
# # # Catalog policy rule
# # # Category access policy rule
The category access policy rule determines which categories users have access to when they create purchase requisitions . If no rule is specified , all the procurement categories can be added to the purchase requisition .
# # # Category policy rule
The category policy rule defines how users can select vendors for each category . It also defines requirements for the receiving and invoicing processes .
# # # Re-approval rule for purchase orders
# # # Purchase requisition RFQ rule
The purchase requisition control rule is an optional rule . When you create rules of this type , you can set options on various tabs :
# # # Requisition purpose rule
# # # Replenishment category access policy rule
# # # Replenishment control rule
# # # Purchase order creation and demand consolidation rule
The purchase order creation and demand consolidation rule defines the policy rules to use when a purchase order is generated from an approved purchase requisition . When you create rules of this type , you can set options on various tabs :
# # Data flow in Prospect to cash

# Organize your workforce by using departments , jobs , and positions
Departments , jobs , and positions are organizational elements that are maintained within Human resources . This topic describes conceptual information about these elements .
The following example is used to illustrate the concepts described in this topic .
&#124; Sales manager &#124; Mng-people – Manage people who report to you . &#124;
# # # Position creation and maintenance
- You can view a history of position-related system changes in an easy-to-access list page .
- You can create reason codes that your users can select when they create or modify positions .
- You can create personnel action types and assign a number sequence to personnel actions .
- You can set up workflow so that position additions and changes can require approval .
When you assign a worker to a position , you fill that position . You can assign workers to multiple positions , but only one worker can be assigned to a position at the same time .
For the previous example , you would complete the following tasks to set up the working relationship between Sanjay Patel and Lori Penor :
1 . Create a custom position hierarchy type called “ Widget ” to create a hierarchy that includes positions responsible for working on the widget cleaner product .
2 . Assign the General Manager position to be the position that the Accountant-A position reports to in the Widget hierarchy .
For some records , you can specify future changes to the record . The following information is date effective .

This article provides an overview of the bonus depreciation functionality .
You can calculate bonus depreciation by using the proposal process , or you can create manual bonus depreciation transactions . You can &apos;t create bonus depreciation transactions if depreciation transactions or depreciation adjustment transactions exist for that asset book .
When you use the proposal process to calculate bonus depreciation , all existing bonus transactions are included in the calculation of the basis . The calculation also includes any previous bonus depreciations that you manually entered for the asset .
The following bonus depreciations are associated with an asset book :
The next bonus depreciation amount , for the Liberty Zone depreciation , is calculated as follows :
If the remaining acquisition cost is 0 ( zero ) or less , bonus depreciation transactions isn &apos;t generated .
When bonus depreciation is calculated by using the proposal process , a bonus depreciation transaction is created for all applicable bonus depreciation records that are associated with the asset book .
You can create an unlimited number of bonus depreciation records . After you assign those records to the asset group book , they are applied to the asset book .
Bonus depreciation is entered as either a percentage or a fixed amount . When you post depreciation proposals , bonus depreciation transactions are posted to the book as separate transactions from the depreciation transactions .

title : Set up interest rates for an interest code
# Set up interest rates for an interest code
Interest codes contain settings that determine when interest is charged and how it is calculated on overdue accounts .
- Rates for interest earnings − These represent revenue that is earned by charging interest on invoices or interest notes .
- Rates for interest payments − These represent a cost that is paid for interest on credit notes .
Both of these rate types can exist at the same time and in the same interest code . Interest rates can be based on three calculation types :
- Interest by percentage .
- Interest by amount .
- Interest by range , which results in a single percentage or amount .
You can set up interest rates that calculate a specified percentage .
- Interest amount applies to all currencies .
- Optional interest amount limits can be entered .
# # Interest rates based on amounts
You can set up interest rates that calculate a specified amount per currency .
- An interest amount is specified for each currency in the interest code .
# # Interest rates based on ranges

This article describes , at a high level , how purchasing professionals can set up and maintain procurement catalogs . Procurement catalogs define the items and services that company employees can order for internal use .
- Configure your procurement category hierarchy before you create the catalog .
- Determine how many procurement catalogs you require . Access to a procurement catalog is determined by the catalog policy rule that you configure for the legal entity and operating unit that an employee is assigned to .
Several factors determine the products that employees can order and the procurement categories that they can use when they create purchase requisitions :
- The category access policy rule in the purchasing policy determines which procurement categories are available in the purchase requisition . If no rule is defined , all procurement categories are available .
- The catalog policy rule specifies the catalog that is used . If no catalog policy rule is defined , the category access rule alone determines the products that an employee can order on the requisition .
The following table describes the tasks that must be completed before a purchasing professional can create a procurement catalog .
# # Setting up a catalog
title : Sales tax calculation methods in the Origin field
# Sales tax calculation methods in the Origin field
This article explains the options in the Origin field on the sales tax codes page and how sales tax is calculated based on the selected option for a sales tax code .
For each sales tax code that you create in the Sales tax codes page , you must select the method of calculation to apply to the tax base amount in the Origin field .
The Percentage of net amount calculation method is the default value in the Origin field . The sales tax is calculated as a percentage of the purchase or sales amount , excluding any other sales taxes .
# # Percentage of gross amount
The tax authority has imposed special duties on an item . The duty amounts are added to the net amount before sales tax is calculated . Given the following sales tax codes :
- DUTY 1 = 10 % , using the Percentage of net amount calculation method
- DUTY 2 = 20 % , using the Percentage of net amount calculation method
- SALESTAX = 25 % , using the Percentage of gross amount calculation method
Given the following sales tax codes :
- DUTY 1 = 10 % , using the Percentage of net amount method
- SALESTAX = 25 % , using the Percentage of gross amount method
&#124; Multilevel tax on tax calculations are not possible . A tax cannot be calculated based on a tax which already is calculated based on another tax . Multiple single level tax on tax codes can be calculated on a transaction . &#124;
When you select Amount per unit in the Origin field , sales tax is calculated as a fixed amount per unit multiplied with the quantity entered on the document line . A unit has to be selected in the Unit field . The amount per unit is specified in the Sales tax code values page .
&#124; If the transaction is entered in different unit than the unit specified on the sales tax code , it is converted automatically based on the unit conversions that are set up in the Unit conversions page . &#124;
# # # Amount per unit , additional option
On the Calculation tab , you can select whether an amount per unit calculated tax is calculated before other tax codes and added to the net amount before other tax codes with Origin = Percentage of net amount are calculated .
Assume we calculate 2 tax codes on a transaction :
- DUTY : Origin = Amount per unit and a sales tax , the value is set to 5.00 per unit = pcs
We sell 1 piece of an item at a unit price of 10.00
# # # # Example 1
# # # # Example 2
# # # # Example 4
# # Calculated percentage of net amount
The Calculated percentage of net amount handles tax calculation differently depending on the setting of the Amounts include sales tax parameter for the document or journal .

- Receipts into inventory are represented by vertical arrows above the timeline .
- Issues out of inventory are represented by vertical arrows below the timeline .
- Above ( or below ) each vertical arrow , the value of the inventory transaction is specified in the format Quantity @ Unitprice .
- An inventory transaction value that is enclosed in parentheses indicates that the inventory transaction is physically posted into inventory .
- An inventory transaction value that isn &apos;t enclosed in parentheses indicates that the inventory transaction is financially posted into inventory .
- Each new receipt or issue transaction is designated by a new label .
- Inventory closings are represented by a red vertical dashed line and the label * Inventory Close * .
- Settlements that are performed by inventory close are represented by red diagonal dashed arrows that go from a receipt to an issue .
# # LIFO Date with the Include physical value option

title : Pay based on registrations
- Time and attendance calculation parameters
# # The use of flex time
# # # Flex profile for one workday
The worker &apos;s registrations for the day looks like this .
To understand this scenario , see the following fields .
# # # # Calculation of Flex +
# # # # Calculation of Flex-
# # # # Calculation of Time
# # # # Calculation of Pay time
# # # Scenario 2 : A worker works during the whole Flex- period and also works overtime
# # # # Calculation of Pay overtime
# # # Generation of pay items
The pay items are the basis for a worker &apos;s pay . You can generate a file that includes the information from the pay items and transfer that file to a payroll system .
For example , for scenario 2 , the following pay items are generated .
# # # Exclude overtime from the standard time
After you adjust the calculation parameters , the following pay items are generated .
# # # Allow a deviation from the standard pay profiles
Consider the following flex profile that represents a workday .
Here are the worker &apos;s registrations for the day .
The following pay items are generated after the transfer .
# # # # Planned breaks
# # # # Paid and unpaid breaks
# # # Example of a planned break
Consider the following time profile that includes an unpaid break for lunch .
&gt; The system calculated 0.5 hours of unpaid break time , and that time isn &apos;t part of the pay time .
# # # Example of a registered break
Consider the following time profile that doesn &apos;t include planned breaks .
When the registrations are calculated , the time for the activities is calculated .
If the planned break had been paid instead of unpaid , the calculation result would look like this .
# # # Pay items and paid breaks
Consider the following time profile .
&#124; Wage type &#124; Pay type &#124; Pay units &#124; Rate &#124;
# # How the cost of paid breaks is allocated to projects and production orders
The hourly cost on project activities and production jobs can be set up so that it &apos;s determined either by the pay rates that are calculated in Time and attendance or by the cost categories that are defined for the activities .
# # # Cost calculation based on pay rates that are calculated in Time and attendance
The following example shows how the hourly cost is calculated when the cost is set up so that it &apos;s calculated based on pay rates .
Consider the following registrations that use the same time profile as the previous example .
After the registrations are transferred , the following transferred registrations are generated .
&#124; Registration type &#124; Time &#124; Cost price per hour &#124;
# # Scenarios based on various combinations of work hour registrations
# # # Scenario 1 : The worker clocks in later than planned
Here is the resulting pay item after the registrations are transferred .
# # # Scenario 4 : The worker clocks in late and clocks out after the planned clock-out time during an overtime period
The following example shows how a worker &apos;s flex account can be reduced by converting the absence period to a Flex- period .
If the worker selects an absence code for illegal absence , here is how the resulting pay item will look after the registration is transferred .
If the worker selects an absence code for legal absence , and the absence code is set up to reduce her flex account , here is how the resulting pay items will look after the registrations are transferred .
- Auto insert Flex-
- Auto insert absence

title : Modeling a lean organization
The article provides information about the key concepts in modeling a lean organization .
Typically , a lean manufacturing scenario is more than just a collection of unrelated kanban rules or material supply policies . The flow of material and products throughout work cells and locations for a specific production or supply scenario can be described as a sequence or small network of process or transfer activities . This sequence or network is known as a production flow .
# # Production flows in lean manufacturing
# # Semi-finished products ( non-BOM levels )
# # Products and material in work in progress
The value stream itself is modeled as an operating unit . Therefore , the value stream can be used as a financial dimension .
# # Costing for lean manufacturing based on the production flow
The periodic consolidation of the cost for a production flow corrects the related WIP account and enables variances to be determined for the products that are supplied by the production flow .

title : Calculations for product configuration models FAQ
# Calculations for product configuration models FAQ
This topic describes calculations for product configuration models and explains how to use calculations together with constraints .
# # What is a calculation ?
A calculation consists of a target attribute and a calculation expression .
# # What is a target attribute ?
A target attribute is an attribute that receives the result of the calculation expression .
In the following expression , the target attribute is a tablecloth measurement :
# # What attribute types can be set to target attributes ?
# # Can the value of a target attribute restrict the values of the input attributes in a calculation ?
In the following expression , the target for the calculation is the length of a power cord , and the input value is a color :
# # When do calculations occur ?
Calculations occur when a value has been provided for all input attributes .
# # Can I overwrite the value that is calculated for the target attribute ?
You can overwrite the value that is calculated for the target attribute , unless the target attribute is set as hidden or read-only .
# # How do I set a target attribute as hidden or read-only ?
To set an attribute as hidden or read-only , follow these steps .
# # Can a calculation overwrite the values that I set ?
No . The values that you set when you configure a product are the values that are used . The calculation that occurs when the input values in a calculation are changed can ’ t overwrite the values that you provide for a specific attribute .
# # What happens if I remove an input value in a calculation ?
If you remove an input value in a calculation , the value of the target attribute is also removed .
# # Why do I receive an error message that says that my model is in contradiction ?
- A value is divided by 0 ( zero ) .
- A conflict exists between the following two elements :
- The values that are available for an attribute and are limited by a constraint
- A value that is generated by a calculation
# # Why do I receive an error message even though I successfully validated my product model ?
Calculations aren &apos;t included in the validation . You must test the product configuration model to find errors in calculations . To test a product configuration model , follow these steps .

title : Transportation management overview
# # Planning transportation in Finance and Operations
title : Manage warehouse workers
# # Monitoring and controlling warehouse work
Analysis of the time that is used to process work items can help drive improvements in the warehouse workers ’ efficiency . The following reports are available to help with this analysis :
title : Dual currency
The posting logic has been changed for all transactions that generate an accounting entry to general ledger . Here is how the reporting currency was previously calculated :
Transaction currency amount \ &gt; Accounting currency amount \ &gt; Reporting currency amount
Here is the new calculation :
Transaction currency amount \ &gt; Accounting currency amount
Transaction currency amount \ &gt; Reporting currency amount
Because of this change , exchange rates must now exist between CAD and USD , and between CAD and EUR .
The changes follow one of two patterns :
- If the report or inquiry had enough space to show amounts in both the accounting currency and the reporting currency , the reporting currency amounts were added .
- If the report or inquiry didn &apos;t have enough space to show amounts in both currencies , an option was added so that users can select which currency is shown .
For various reports and inquiries , logic was also added to suppress the reporting currency amounts if the reporting currency is the same as the accounting currency , or if the reporting currency wasn &apos;t defined on the ledger for the legal entity .
The following modules use the reporting currency as a second accounting currency :
If a reporting currency was defined on the ledger , the general ledger already tracked reporting currency amounts on every accounting entry . However , those amounts are now translated from the transaction currency amounts .
The following additional changes were made in the * * General ledger * * module :
# # # Accounts payable and Accounts receivable
- Reporting currency amounts are now shown on transactions for both customers and vendors . Reporting currency amounts are also shown for the open balance of each transaction .
- The aging process has been updated so that an organization can view the aging buckets in either the accounting currency or the reporting currency .
# # # Cash and bank management
- The way that the depreciation process determines the reporting currency amount has changed . The following scenario compares how depreciation previously determined the reporting currency amount and how it determines the reporting currency amount now .
An asset is acquired and posted with the following amounts . Note that the reporting currency amount is posted in the general ledger , but it isn &apos;t stored in the Fixed asset subledger tables .
At the end of the year , the depreciation proposal is run and calculates the following amounts .
The depreciation process has been changed so that the reporting currency amount is also calculated by using the depreciation method . Here are the results when depreciation is run on the asset .
When the depreciation proposal is run , it calculates both the accounting currency amount and the reporting currency amount by using the depreciation method . The amounts are then used in the accounting entry in the general ledger . No translation is done to determine the reporting currency amount .
- The exchange rate and reporting currency amounts can be changed . If the exchange rate is changed , the reporting currency amount is recalculated by using the new rate .
- If a deprecation transaction type is entered in the Fixed asset journal , the reporting currency amounts will appear in the new columns . Those amounts can be changed .

title : Accounts payable invoice matching
When matching documents , differences among these documents are called matching discrepancies . Matching discrepancies are compared with the tolerances that are specified . If a matching discrepancy exceeds the tolerance percentage or amount , match variance icons are displayed on the Vendor invoice page and on the Invoice history and matching details page .
You can use the following types of Accounts payable invoice matching :
- Two-way matching – Match the price information on the invoice to the price information on the purchase order .
- Three-way matching – Match the price information on the invoice to the price information on the purchase order . Also match the quantity information on the invoice to the quantity information on the product receipts that are selected for the invoice .
&gt; Other forms of invoice validation can be done using vendor invoice policies .
Two-way matching and three-way matching always match price information by the unit price . You can also configure these matching policies to match price information by the price total .
# # Two-way , price totals matching
Price totals matching can be based on a percentage , an amount , or a percentage and amount .
If a purchase price total tolerance amount is specified , five fields are compared , as shown in the following table . Because the purchase price total tolerance amount is 100.00 , the price total variance amount of 105.00 represents a matching discrepancy .
# # Two-way , net unit price matching
# # Two-way , price totals matching and net unit price matching
You can use price totals matching and net unit price matching together . This example assumes the following configuration :
The purchase order contains the following line .
&#124; Item number &#124; Quantity &#124; Unit price &#124; Net amount &#124;
Use three-way matching to help make sure that the variance between the price information on the purchase order and the invoice is within acceptable tolerances , and to make sure that the quantity on the invoice matches the quantity on the corresponding product receipts .
The same line amounts are compared on the Invoice matching details page as for two-way matching . In addition , the quantity on the invoice is matched to product receipt quantities that have been received . If the invoice quantity differs from the matched product receipt quantity , a quantity matching error exists .
&#124; Line field &#124; Invoice value &#124; Match status &#124;
&#124; Total product receipts matched &#124; 0.00 &#124; Failed &#124;
&gt; A variance percentage of 99,999,999,999.99 % means that the expected amount based on the purchase order is zero and the actual amount on the invoice is a positive value .
&gt; Charges matching is performed only on charges codes for which the Compare purchase order and invoice values toggle is selected on the Charges code page .
Vendor invoices are often based on product receipts that represent actual shipments , instead of on purchase orders . Sometimes the invoiced amounts do not match the purchase order amounts , and sometimes the shipped quantities do not match the invoiced quantities . You can help manage this information in the following ways :
- View and approve quantity differences between the invoiced quantity on the invoice and the received quantity on the product receipt . If there is a difference , you can save the invoice and later match it to a different product receipt , or change the invoiced quantity to match the received quantity .
title : Address books FAQ
How do I check for duplicate records ?
# # Can I bulk add or delete party records from an address book ?
Yes , you can add multiple party records to an address book and also remove multiple party records .
You can update the name of a party record , and the addresses that are associated with that record , at any time .
# # Can I merge two or more party records into one record ?

The purpose of Quick import export is to let you import and export with fewer steps .
We added the Quick Import Export feature to let users import or export simple jobs that they want to execute quickly . Ideally this feature is used in scenarios in which a file automatically maps to the system and user does not need to go through advanced mapping or create repeated import or export jobs .
- This feature supports working with both out-of-the-box and custom entities .
- You can import from files , and if you are using an ODBC data source , you can select a query to use to define your import .
Note that Quick import export assumes that you are familiar with the concepts of DIXF .

title : Depreciation effects with reversals
This article discusses potential implications of reversing a fixed asset transaction .
You can reverse fixed asset transactions , and the transactions that are associated with a fixed asset . You can also revoke a reversed transaction .
The following examples show the calculations that occur if you continue beyond the message without first reversing the depreciation transactions .
# # Example 1 : Depreciation is overstated
An asset is set up with a 5-year useful life and straight line depreciation ( 60 depreciation periods ) . In this example , depreciation is overstated .
&#124; January 1 &#124; Acquisition &#124; 59,000.00 &#124;
&#124; January 1 &#124; Acquisition adjustment &#124; 1,000.00 &#124;
# # # # Reversal action
&#124; January 1 &#124; Acquisition adjustment reversal &#124; – 1,000.00 &#124;
Depreciation is overstated by 16.95 ( 1,000 - 983.05 ) .
# # Example 2 : Depreciation is understated
An asset is set up with a 5-year useful life and straight line depreciation ( 60 depreciation periods ) . In this example , depreciation is understated .

title : Inventory close
As part of the process to settle issue transactions with receipt transactions , you can also choose to have the general ledger updated to reflect the adjustments that have been made .
How often the inventory close process is run varies by company . However , transaction volume should help determine how often you decide to run inventory close . In general , most companies run inventory close as part of their month-end close and reconciliation procedures .
# # Inventory recalculation and the general ledger
If adjustments to inventory and the general ledger are required during a month or other inventory period , you can run inventory recalculation instead of inventory close . Inventory recalculation makes adjustments but doesn &apos;t make settlements to inventory transactions .
During inventory recalculation , on-hand inventory is adjusted , inventory transactions are adjusted , and inventory recalculations and inventory closes are run . These tasks affect any ledger account that is linked to the original inventory transaction .
After the update is completed , you can review the ledger voucher that is posted because of one of these tasks .
# # Effects of the inventory close process on the general ledger
- Inventory close isn &apos;t required if you use the Standard cost valuation method .
- Before you run the closing procedure , you can view a list of items that can &apos;t be settled during the update .
- We recommend that you run inventory close during off-peak hours , to distribute computing resources more evenly .
After the inventory close process has been completed , a message in the message center might inform you that a unit cost price might be incorrect because a transaction could not be fully settled .
If you receive many warnings in the message , we recommend that you perform the following actions :
- Update receipts financially .
- Advance the closing date .
- Reevaluate the business procedures .

# # Quickly navigate to a particular page
The search results list displays the page title as well as the navigation path . This shows the location of the page in the application . It also helps you differentiate between two or more similar pages in the results .
# # Quickly navigate to a page based on the technical form name
From an administration and security perspective , the navigation search functionality only surfaces two types of results :
- Pages that are enabled in the current configuration ( via configuration keys ) .
The list of search results is limited to 10 items . If you do not find what you &apos;re looking for in the results , you should try refining or updating the input .
From a development perspective , the navigation search functionality is easy to leverage because there is virtually no delay between the deployment of menu items and their ability to show up in search results . As long as the menu items are linked to from either the navigation pane or the dashboard , they will automatically become searchable .
To set up standard costs , follow these steps .
Customers who want to change their existing items to a standard cost inventory model must use the * * Standard cost conversions * * page .

title : Routes and operations
A simple route is sequential , and there is only one starting point for the route .
If you enable the more complex route networks in the Production control parameters , you can define routes that have multiple starting points and operations that can be run in parallel .
# # # Approval of routes
The following operational properties of an operation are maintained on the operation relation :
- Notes and instructions
# # # Maintaining operation relations per route
# # # Maintaining operation relations per operation
Route versions are used to accommodate variations in the production of products or provide greater control over the production process . They define which route should be used when a specific released product or released product variant is produced . You can use the following constraints to define which route is used for a released product :
In the Production control parameters , you can require that the validity period of a route version always be specified .
# # # Approval of route versions
# # # Activating the default route version
# # # Product change that uses case management
The product change case for the approval and activation of new or changed routes and route versions gives you an easy way to see an overview of the route version constraints . You can also approve and activate all routes that are related to a specific change in one operation and document the results in the product change case .
Depending on your business requirements , you might be able to reduce the effort that is required in order to maintain your process definitions .
# # # Making routes independent of resources
# # # Standard operation relations
If you also express resource requirements in terms of skills and capabilities , and make your routes site-independent , you can help keep the ongoing maintenance of your business processes to a minimum .

title : Determine the BOM version
# Determine the BOM version
During a demand explosion , if an item has a default order type of Production , the planning engine finds a valid BOM version based on the site .
The site dimension is always known and is stated on the demand transaction . The following process is used to determine the BOM version to use :
- If there is a BOM version defined for the item at the demand site , the site-specific BOM is used .
- If there is no general BOM version to use , the demand explosion stops at this point .
A valid BOM version , whether site-specific or general , must meet the required criteria for date and quantity .

title : Retail sales price management
The following terms are used in this topic .
When you create price groups , you should not use a single price group for multiple types of retail entities . Otherwise , it can be difficult to determine why a specific price or discount is being applied to a transaction .
Loyalty programs have additional functionality besides prices and discounts . However , from the perspective of pricing and discounts , they are the same as affiliations .
# # # Best practices for price groups
Avoid setting price groups directly on a customer . Instead , use an affiliation . In this way , you can assign all types of prices and discounts to customers , not just sales price trade agreements .
To use pricing priority for prices , you must assign a pricing priority to a price group and then create a sales price trade agreement for that price group .
Let &apos;s look at an example where store prices override other prices .
# # Types of prices
In Microsoft Dynamics 365 , you can set the price of a product in three places :
- Directly on the product ( base price )
- In a sales price trade agreement
- In a price adjustment
If a retail channel &apos;s currency differs from the company currency , the base price in that retail channel is determined by using currency conversion on the price that is set on the product .
# # # Sales price trade agreement
&gt; A trade agreement price is always used before the base price .
# # Determining price for a product in a transaction
The retail pricing engine returns three prices for every product : the base price , the trade agreement price , and the active price .
The base price is just the property on the product and is the same for everyone everywhere .
To easily update the prices of various products from different product categories , you can use the supplemental product categories together with the category price rules .
# # Prices that include tax vs. prices that exclude tax
# # Differences between retail pricing and non-retail pricing
A single pricing engine is used to calculate retail prices across all channels : Call center , Retail store , and Online stores . This helps in enabling the unified commerce scenarios .
Retail pricing is designed to work with retail entities instead of non-retail entities . Specifically , it &apos;s designed to set prices by store , not by warehouse .
The retail pricing engine doesn &apos;t support the following pricing features :
- Attribute-based pricing
- Vendor discount pass-through
In addition , * * only * * the retail pricing engine supports the following pricing features :
- The same price group can be used to control pricing and discounts .

Job scheduling schedules all productions that are referenced by the current production . If a production has one or more subproductions , the subproductions should be scheduled at the same time as the main production , because the main production can &apos;t be started until the related subproductions are completed .

title : Straight line service life depreciation
# Straight line service life depreciation
This article gives an overview of the Straight line service life method of depreciation .
When you set up a fixed asset depreciation profile and select Straight line service life in the Method field in the Depreciation profiles page , the assets that have this depreciation profile assigned to them are depreciated based on the total service life of the asset . This generally is the same depreciation amount in each depreciation period .
The difference in the depreciation amount that is calculated between straight line service life remaining and straight line service life is when there is an adjustment posted to the asset .
To set up straight line service life depreciation , you must also select options in the Depreciation year and Period frequency fields in the Depreciation profiles page .
You can select either Calendar or Fiscal in the Depreciation year field in the Depreciation profiles page . The selection defines the options that are available in the Period frequency field . The default option is Calendar .
If you select Calendar , a year of January 1 to December 31 is assumed , even if you have defined the fiscal calendar differently .
The Calendar option updates the depreciation base , which is typically the net book value minus the salvage value , on January 1 of each year . In the examples later in this topic , the depreciation base is the numerator in the first expression in the calculations column .
If you select Calendar , the following options are available in the Period frequency field , which defines the depreciation accrual posting dates and amounts throughout the calendar year :
- Yearly posts an amount on December 31 .
- Monthly posts a monthly amount at the end of each calendar month .
- Half-Yearly posts a half-yearly amount at the end of each calendar half year ( June 30 and December 31 ) .
- Daily posts the depreciation amount for the daily depreciation method using one transaction for each day .
- Yearly posts the total amount of the depreciation that is calculated for the fiscal year as one amount on the last day of the fiscal year .
# # Example : Straight line depreciation of an unchanged fixed asset
Suppose that a fixed asset has the following characteristics .
&#124; Yearly depreciation &#124; 2,000 &#124;
You get the same depreciation amount each year . ( Acquisition cost - Salvage value ) / Service life years
&#124; Period &#124; Calculation of yearly depreciation amount &#124; Net book value at the end of the year &#124;
# # Example : Straight line depreciation of a modified fixed asset
Suppose that you add an acquisition adjustment of 4,000 in year 2 to the same fixed asset .
The service life of the acquisition adjustment is the same as that of the fixed asset and starts at the time of its acquisition . A net book value remains at the end of year 5 , corresponding to the net book value of the acquisition adjustment . The depreciation by period is calculated as shown in the following table .
\ * Because the remaining amount is less than the depreciation amount , only the remaining amount minus the salvage value is taken .

In an omni-channel retail world , many retailers provide the option of customer orders , or special orders , to meet various product and fulfillment requirements . Here are some typical scenarios :
- A customer wants products to be delivered to a specific address on a specific date .
- A customer wants to pick up products from a store or location that differs from the store or location where the customer purchased those products .
- A customer wants someone else to pick up products that the customer purchased .
# # Set up customer orders
Here are some of the parameters that can be set on the * * Retail parameters * * page to define how customer orders are fulfilled :
# # Transaction flow for customer orders
1 . Add a customer to the transaction .
2 . Add products to the cart .
6 . Collect the deposit amount , if a deposit is required .
# # # Edit an existing customer order
# # # Pick up an order
# # # Cancel an order
# # Asynchronous transaction flow for customer orders
Customer orders can be created from the point of sale ( POS ) client in either synchronous mode or asynchronous mode .
# # # Enable customer orders to be created in asynchronous mode
title : Simulate cost changes by using a costing version for planned costs
# Simulate cost changes by using a costing version for planned costs
This article explains how you can simulate the effects of cost changes on a manufactured item ’ s calculated costs by using a separate costing version for planned costs .
# # Guidelines for defining the simulation costing version
Use the following guidelines when you define the costing version for simulations :
- Allow the entry of cost records . Don &apos;t block the entry of pending costs .
- Prevent the activation of pending costs . Only pending costs must be entered for cost records in the simulation costing version .
# Track running average cost per inventory dimension
An inventory dimension group is attached to every inventory item . Therefore , the running average cost price of an item is calculated based on the selected inventory dimensions that are being tracked financially .
If the storage dimension group that is attached to the item is financially tracked by warehouse , the running average cost price is calculated per warehouse . The following purchase orders have been invoiced :
- A purchase order for a quantity of 2 at a cost price of USD 10.00 has been invoiced for warehouse GW .
- A purchase order for a quantity of 3 at a cost price of USD 12.00 has been invoiced for warehouse GW .
- A purchase order for a quantity of 5 at a cost price of USD 15.00 has been invoiced for warehouse MW .
title : Retail peripherals
This topic explains the concepts that are related to retail peripherals . It describes the various ways that peripherals can be connected to the point of sale ( POS ) and the components that are responsible for managing the connection with the POS .
POS peripherals are devices that are explicitly supported for POS functions . These peripherals are typically divided into specific classes . For more information about these classes , see the “ Device classes ” section of this topic .
POS peripherals are typically divided into classes . This section describes and gives an overview of the devices that Modern POS supports .
Personal identification number ( PIN ) pads are supported through OPOS , but they must be managed via a payment connector .
- OPOS also supports a more extensive set of variables that are specific to retail receipt printers , such as paper cutting or slip printing .
# # # Universal Windows Platform
# # Hardware station deployment options
# # # Hardware station installation
# # # OPOS device setup and configuration
Within the ServiceOPOS registry location , configured devices are organized according to the OPOS device class . Multiple device drivers are saved .
# # Supported scenarios by hardware station type
# # # Client support – IPC hardware station vs. IIS hardware station
&#124; Client &#124; IPC hardware station &#124; IIS hardware station &#124;
Network peripherals can be supported directly through the hardware station that is built into the Modern POS for Windows application . For all other clients , you must deploy an IIS hardware station .
# # Supported device types by hardware station type
# # Configuration for supported scenarios
1 . Create a hardware profile where all the required peripherals are configured .
2 . Map the hardware profile to the POS register .
3 . On the dedicated hardware station , set the following properties :
12 . On the hardware station management page , set the option to turn on the hardware station .
15 . On the hardware station selection page , click the recently selected hardware station to make it active .
This configuration can be used for all Modern POS clients that share hardware stations with other devices . To set up this configuration , follow these steps .
1 . Create a hardware profile where the required peripherals are configured .
3 . On the shared hardware station , set the following properties :
13 . On the hardware station management page , set the option to turn on the hardware station .
- No additional network ports should be open , unless they are required for known , specified reasons .
- Cross-origin resource sharing must be disabled and must specify the allowed origins that are accepted .
- Only trusted certificate authorities should be used to obtain certificates that will be used on computers that run the hardware station .
# # # IPC ( built-in ) hardware station
The following peripherals were tested by using the IPC hardware station that is built into Modern POS for Windows .
# # # # Bar code scanner
# # # # Payment terminal
# # # # Cash drawer
# # # # Line display
# # # # Signature capture
# # # Dedicated IIS hardware station
# # # Shared IIS hardware station
- The hardware station has correctly installed merchant account information through the Install merchant information tool that runs at the end of the hardware station installer .
# # # Modern POS can ’ t detect the hardware station in its list for selection
- The hardware station hasn ’ t been set up correctly in headquarters . Use the steps earlier in this topic to verify that the hardware station profile and the hardware station are correctly entered .
- The jobs haven ’ t been run to update the channel configuration . In this case , run the 1070 job for channel configuration .
# # # Modern POS doesn &apos;t reflect new cash drawer settings
- If the retail peripheral is shared with multiple POS devices , make sure that it belongs to one of the following categories :
- Receipt printer
If the peripheral doesn &apos;t belong to one of these categories , the hardware station isn &apos;t designed to enable the peripheral to be shared among multiple POS devices .

# Electronic reporting ( ER )
The ER engine has the following capabilities :
# # # # Data model components
- A data model , as a set of domain-specific business entities and a hierarchically structured definition of relations between those entities .
- Customer \ &gt; Company \ &gt; Payment transactions of the AR domain
Note that business entities such as company and payment transactions are designed one time . Different mappings then reuse them .
A model mapping that supports outgoing electronic documents has the following capabilities :
- It supports user input parameters that can be defined as data sources for a data model when some data must be specified at run time .
A model mapping that supports incoming electronic documents has the following capabilities :
A data model component is designed for each business domain that should be used as a unified data source for reporting that isolates reporting from the physical implementation of data sources . It represents domain-specific business concepts and functionalities in a form that makes a reporting format &apos;s initial design and further maintenance more efficient .
# # # # Format components for outgoing electronic documents
A format component is the scheme of the reporting output that will be generated at run time . A scheme consists of the following elements :
- A format that defines the structure and content of the outgoing electronic document that is generated at run time .
- Data sources , as a set of user input parameters and a domain-specific data model that uses a selected model mapping .
A format component supports the following functions :
- Creation of multiple files separately and encapsulation of those files into zip files .
A format component lets you attach specific files that can be used in the reporting output :
- Excel workbooks that contain a worksheet that can be used as a template for output in the OPENXML worksheet format
- Word files that contain a document that can be used as a template for output in the Microsoft Word document format
- Other files that can be incorporated into the format &apos;s output as predefined files
The following illustration shows how the data flows for these formats .
To run a single ER format configuration and generate an outgoing electronic document , you must identify the mapping of the format configuration .
# # # # Format components for incoming electronic documents
# # # # Component versioning
Versioning is supported for ER components . The following workflow is provided to manage changes in ER components :
- The component can be serialized in XML format and exported as a file in XML format .
# # # # Component date effectivity
# # # # Component access
Each model configuration contains a data model component . A new format configuration can be derived from a specific data model configuration . In the configuration tree , the format configuration that is created appears as a child of the original data model configuration .
The format configuration that is created contains a format component . The data model component of the original model configuration is automatically inserted into the format component of the child format configuration as a default data source .
An ER configuration is shared for Finance and Operations companies .

There are three types of allocation bases in Cost accounting :
- Predefined dimension member allocation bases
- Hierarchy allocation bases
- Formula allocation bases
# # Predefined dimension member allocation bases
The predefined dimension member allocation bases are created automatically when a dimension member of one the following types is created :
- Statistical dimension members
- Cost element dimension members
&gt; The predefined dimension member allocation bases that are based on a cost element dimension member consider the values only from the data source provider , such as the general ledger or budget .
In the general ledger , the chart of account is defined as follows .
&#124; Chart of account &#124; Main account &#124; Description &#124; Main account type &#124;
Define a cost element dimension , and configure the data connector . After the data is imported , the following entries are created in Cost accounting .
* * Predefined dimension member allocation bases * *
&#124; Name &#124; Description &#124; Cost element dimension &#124;
In the general ledger , the following entries have been posted :
- The expense for employee insurance is manually posted to a default cost center .
After the general ledger source data is processed , the following entries are created in Cost accounting .
&#124; Cost object dimension hierarchy node &#124; Cost element dimension hierarchy node &#124; Cost behavior &#124; Allocation base &#124;
* * Perform overhead calculation * *
After cost element 10001 ( Salaries ) is applied as the allocation base , the result of the overhead calculation is as follows .
* * Cost object balance journal entries * *
Statistical dimension members can be used as allocation bases to define policies or report non-monetary consumption by cost objects . You can manually create statistical dimension members or import them from a file by using the Data management import / export tool .
&#124; Statistical elements &#124; FTE &#124; Full time employees &#124; Ea &#124;
When a statistical dimension member is saved , a corresponding record is created in the predefined dimension member allocation bases .
&#124; FTE &#124; Full time employees &#124; Statistical elements &#124;
&#124; Electricity &#124; Electricity consumption &#124; Statistical elements &#124;
Statistical measures can come from various sources :
- Electricity consumption can be measured by meters that are installed in different areas of the company .
- Tables hold statistical measures . For example , the HcmEmployment table holds a list of all employees and the cost centers that they work for .
&#124; Name &#124; Cost center &#124; Description &#124; Worker type &#124;
&gt; All the tables that contain financial dimensions can be used as sources for statistical measures .
Cost accounting supports a collection of statistical measures by using the following data connections :
- Data management import / export tool
- Statistical measures
After the statistical measure source data is processed , the following entries will be created in Cost accounting .
Here is an example of a cost distribution rule if the FTE ’ s predefined dimension member allocation basis is assigned as the allocation base in it .
&#124; Cost object &#124; Description &#124; Magnitude &#124; Allocation factor &#124;
&#124; Accounting date &#124; Dimension member &#124; Magnitude &#124; Source identifier &#124;
Here is an example of a cost distribution rule if the Electricity predefined dimension member allocation basis is assigned as the allocation base in it .
Cost accountants can manually create the hierarchy allocation bases by applying a cost object dimension hierarchy node to an existing allocation base . In this way , you can limit the range of the original predefined dimension member allocation basis . One predefined dimension member allocation basis can be used to create several hierarchy allocation bases . Ranges can be maintained in the cost object dimension hierarchy that is associated with the hierarchy allocation bases .
# # # Example : Hierarchy allocation bases that are based on full-time employees in the organization
Here is an example of a cost object dimension hierarchy that can be created to describe a simplified organization .
The FTE ’ s predefined dimension member allocation basis that was created in the previous section holds the following entries .
A cost must be distributed between cost centers that report to the organization &apos;s chief financial officer ( CFO ) . It &apos;s acknowledged that the correct allocation ratio is the number of full-time employees ( FTEs ) by cost center .
&#124; Name &#124; Allocation base &#124; Cost object dimension hierarchy &#124; Cost object dimension hierarchy node &#124;
&#124; Number of FTEs in CFO &#124; FTE ’ s &#124; Organization &#124; CFO &#124;
A Preview function lets you validate the hierarchy allocation basis that is created , based on statistical entries in the system .
Here is an example of a cost distribution rule if the Number of FTEs in CFO hierarchy allocation basis is assigned as the allocation base in it .
Formula allocation bases let you define advanced formulas to achieve the correct allocation basis . You can manually create formula allocation bases .
&gt; Previously defined formula allocation bases can be used to define a new formula allocation base .
In formula allocation base factors , you create an alias , and associate it with either an allocation base or a constant . The aliases are then used to define the formula .
You can use the following operators to define your formula .
# # # Example 1 : A simple formula
- A fixed fee for being connected to grid
- A cost that is associated with consumption per kWh
The Electricity predefined dimension member allocation basis has already been defined and holds these values .
If the fixed fee must now be evenly spread over cost objects that consume electricity , you have two options for allocating the costs :
&#124; Electricity fixed &#124; &#124; Statistical elements &#124; &#124;
Note that 0 ( zero ) isn &apos;t supported as a constant .
A Preview function lets you validate the formula allocation base that is created , based on statistical entries in the system .
Here is an example of a cost distribution rule if the Electricity formula allocation base is assigned as the allocation base in it .
* * Cost object magnitude allocation factor * *
&#124; Cost object &#124; Name &#124; Magnitude &#124; Allocation factor &#124;
# # # Example 2 : An advanced formula
For this example , the cost of electricity should not just follow the actual electricity that is consumed in kWh . Management wants to incorporate incentive for lowering electricity usage .
A new formula allocation base , Electricity usage , is created .
Here is a closer look at the formula for CC003 ( IT ) :
Here is an example of a cost distribution rule if the Electricity fixed formula allocation base is assigned as the allocation base in it .

title : Generate printable FTI forms
# # Create customized configurations for FTI printable forms
As part of your customized solution for printable FTI forms , you must create a set of ER configurations .
# # # Configure the ER data model
# # # Configure the ER model mapping
The mapping must contain the following data sources :
- It must refer to the CustInvoiceJour application table .
- It &apos;s used at runtime to pass from the application to the ER model mapping the list of invoices that have been selected for printing .
- It &apos;s used at runtime to pass from the application to the ER model mapping details of the print management settings for the ER format that is running .
# # # Configure the ER format
In your application instance , you must have the ER format configuration that will be used to generate FTI forms .
3 . Select the document level to specify the scope of invoices for processing .
4 . Select the ER format for the specified document level .
FTI forms are generated in the ER framework in the same way that SSRS reports are generated .
To generate FTI forms , you can select invoices either by range or by selection .
The ER framework currently supports the following destinations for generated documents :
# # Download sample ER configurations to generate printable FTI forms
&gt; These configurations have been created as samples to help clarify possible scenarios . The future of these configurations depends on the results of this evaluation and any feedback that is received .
In the sample ER format configuration , an Excel file is used as a template to generate FTI forms .
Currently , this sample ER format supports the following features to generate FTI forms :
- FTI forms are generated for both original invoices that have been posted and original invoices that haven &apos;t yet been posted . Corrected invoices and credit notes aren &apos;t supported .
- FTI forms are generated in the invoice language . The format of values and dates in the generated forms is based on the settings of the user &apos;s client locale .
- Generated invoices show data unavailability notifications if there are no lines in the invoices that are processed .
- The generated invoice lines and invoice totals sections show the default invoice &apos;s monetary details in the invoice registration currency .
- Generated invoice forms include notes for the customer FTI form and the processing invoice language when they have been configured in the AR form notes list .
- The totals section of generated invoice forms includes any cash discount information that is available .
- The payment schedule section of generated invoice forms includes any payment schedule details that are available .
- The markup section of generated invoice forms includes any charges transactions that are available .
- Generated invoices show any prepayment details that are available for posted invoices .
- Generated invoice forms can be sent to an invoice customer as an email attachment . The appropriate ER file destination should be configured for the ER format that is being used .
The Enterprise register term is put on the header of the generated invoice form when the invoice is processed for a legal entity that is configured in the following manner :
- The special regime for the cash accounting method is enabled on the invoice processing date .
In addition to the generated invoice form , Giro money transfer slips can be generated as follows :
&gt; The sample ER format has been configured to optionally generate the Giro money transfer slips in the separate worksheet .
&gt; You must first install the font that is used to generate the bar code on the local machine where the generated invoice form in Excel format will be previewed .

title : Bills of materials and formulas
# Bills of materials and formulas
When it &apos;s combined with a route or production flow that describes the operations and resources that are required in order to build a product , the BOM forms the foundation for calculating the estimated cost of the product .
A BOM is an individual entity that is described by the following information :
- BOM name
- The BOM lines that describe the components and ingredients
- The BOM versions , which define the product and period that the BOM can be used for
A single BOM describes a single level that is identified by a unique ID . Components might have their own BOMs that are referenced by BOM versions . You can display and edit the complete hierarchy of BOMs for a specific product in the BOM designer .
# # # Formulas , co-products , and by-products
# # # BOMs in the product lifecycle
In the product lifecycle , many types of BOM might be created for various reasons :
# # # Approval of BOMs and formulas
Note that , if a BOM is unapproved , all related BOM versions are also unapproved .
# # BOM and formula versions
# # # Approval of BOM and formula versions
# # # Activation of the default BOM or formula version
# # # Product change with case management
The product change case for approval and activation of new or changed BOMs and BOM versions provides an easy way to see an overview of the BOM version constraints . You can also approve and activate all BOMs and formulas that are related to a specific change for one activation date .

The following table shows an example of the changes in status and version that a PO might go through when change management is turned on .
# # # POS platform and form factor considerations
Retail supports the following POS options :
- The user interface ( UI ) is consistent , regardless of the platform or form factor .
- Customizations and extensions can easily be used across platforms and form factors . Because the core application code is shared , most customizations can be implemented one time instead of multiple times .
Although MPOS and CPOS are largely the same , there are some important differences that you must understand .
In addition to a platform and form factor , retailers must also choose a deployment option at the store . The following table shows the configurations that are available for each POS option .
# # # # Retail server
# # # # Offline mode
# # # POS peripheral / hardware considerations

title : Reason codes for inventory counting
# Reason codes for inventory counting
Reason codes let you analyze the results of a counting process and any discrepancies that occur during that process . You can specify the reason for doing the count , such as a broken pallet or a stock adjustment that is based on inventory samples .
Before you set up the system , we recommend that you define a strategy for working with reason codes . For example , try to answer the following questions :
- Should reason codes be mandatory on warehouses ?
- Should reason codes be mandatory or optional on some items ?
- How many reason codes do you require ?
- How should users of barcode scanners use reason codes ? Should the reason codes be preselected , mandatory , or not editable ?
- Do warehouse workers require different reason code behavior on mobile scanners ? If the answer is yes , you can create more menu items and assign them to different people .
# # Where reason codes apply
You can create multiple reason code policies , and each reason code policy can have two counting reason code policies . The counting reason code policies can be used at the warehouse level or the item level .
# # Set up reason code policies
- Spot Count ( mobile device )
- Threshold Count ( mobile device )
- Adjustment In ( mobile device )
- Adjustment Out ( mobile device )
- Counting Journal ( rich client )
# # # Set up reason codes for warehouses
# # # Set up reason codes for products
# # # Use reason codes in counting journals
In a counting journal , you can add reason codes for counts of the following types :
- Adjustment In
- Adjustment Out
Reason codes are added to the journal lines in counting journals of the * * Counting journal * * type .
# # # View the counting history as it &apos;s recorded by reason codes
# # # Use a reason code for a quantity adjustment
# # # Configure reason codes for mobile device menu items
You can configure reason codes for any type of count on a mobile device menu item . The configuration of the mobile device menu item includes the following information :
- Whether the reason code is shown to the mobile device worker during counting .
- The default reason code that is shown on a mobile device menu item .
- Whether the user can edit the reason code .
Before a count is approved , the user can change the reason code that is associated with the count . When the count is approved , the reason code is entered on the counting journal lines .
# # # Modify cycle count approvals
# # # Modify the mobile device menu item for Adjustment in and Adjustment out
- Default counting reason code
- Display counting reason code
- Edit counting reason code

title : Information used in BOM calculations with standard costs
# Information used in BOM calculations with standard costs
The purchased item information that is used in a standard cost BOM calculation includes the following :
- Cost group − The cost group that is assigned to a purchased item provides the basis for cost segmentation in the calculated costs of a manufactured item .
The manufactured item information that is used in a standard cost BOM calculation includes the following :
- Warning conditions that are embedded in the item ’ s BOM calculation group enable the BOM calculation to identify potential problems . One example could be that the manufactured item does not have a BOM or route . The applicable warning conditions can be overridden when initiating a BOM calculation .
The bill of material information that is used in a standard cost BOM calculation includes the following :
- BOM line item valid dates − A component can have valid from and to dates .
- BOM line item type of production − The costing lot size for amortizing constant costs will reflect the BOM calculation quantity and a make-to-order explosion mode , because the BOM calculation assumes that the manufactured component will be produced to the exact quantity instead of its standard order quantity .
- Ignore BOM line item in cost calculations − A component can be ignored for BOM calculation purposes .
The operations resource information that is used in a standard cost BOM calculation includes :
- Overriding operations resource information on routing operations − The resource information about cost categories will be inherited by operations , where it can be overridden . BOM calculations will use the cost category information that is specified on the routing operations .
The route information that is used in a standard cost BOM calculation includes :
The manufacturing overhead information that is used in a standard cost BOM calculation includes :
- Time-based versus material-based overhead − The manufacturing overhead can be tied to routing operations or material components .
The costing version information that is used in a standard cost BOM calculation includes :
- Blocking flag for pending costs − A blocking flag can prevent BOM calculations of the pending cost for manufactured items .
- Specified site − A specified site will limit BOM calculations to the single site .
- Content of the costing version must include costs − The content must include costs . It can optionally include sales prices in order to calculate suggested sales prices for manufactured items .
Several sources of information can be specified when initiating a BOM calculation . This includes the site , the calculation date , and the costing version .

title : Credit and collections in Accounts receivable
# Credit and collections in Accounts receivable
Before you begin to set up or work with collections , you should understand the following concepts :
- Customer aging snapshots contain aged balance information at a point in time
- Collections customer pools help you organize your work
- Collections agents can have their own customer pools
- List pages organize collections customers , activities , and cases
- All collections information for a customer is on one page and you can take action from that page
- Waive , reinstate , or reverse interest and fees can be done in one step
- Create write-off transactions can be done in one step
- Process not sufficient funds ( NSF ) payments can be done in one step
The following sections describe each concept .
An aging snapshot contains the calculated aged balances for a customer at a point in time . This information is displayed on the Aged balances list page and on the Collections page . An aging snapshot must be created before you can view information on the Collections list pages .
For each customer , an aging snapshot contains an aging snapshot header and detail records that correspond to each aging period in the aging period definition .
The following list pages help you organize collections information .
- Collections activities – The columns on the list page display activities that are identified as collections activities . These activities are created by using the Collections page . Use activities to track the work that you do related to collections .
Use the Collections page to view , manage , and take action on collections information , activities , and cases for a customer .
FactBoxes display aged balances and credit limit information for the selected customer . This information is stored in the aging snapshot . If necessary , you can update the aging snapshot with current information .
# # Waive , reinstate , or reverse interest and fees
These adjustments affect only interest notes , and the interest and fees that they include . Use the steps in the “ Create write-off transactions in one step ” section to write off all of the charges that a customer owes .
You can write off bad debts by clicking Write off in the Collections form , and on the Aged balances , Customers , and Open customer invoices list pages .

title : Statistical dimension members and statistical measure provider templates
# Statistical dimension members and statistical measure provider templates
A statistical dimension and its members are used to register and control non-monetary entries in Cost accounting . Statistical dimension members can be used for two purposes :
- As an allocation base in policies such as cost distribution or cost allocation
- For reporting of non-monetary consumption
&gt; A statistical dimension can be assigned to more than one Cost accounting ledger .
Here is an example of a statistical dimension .
&#124; Name &#124; Data connector for dimension members &#124;
&#124; Shared Statistical elements &#124; Imported dimension members &#124;
A statistical dimension member represents an entity that you want to register non-monetary measures for . These measures can be used either as an allocation base or just to report non-monetary values .
Statistical dimension members can be created manually . Alternatively , they can be imported from a file by using the Data management import / export tool .
A statistical dimension member automatically becomes a predefined allocation base . It can be used as an allocation base in policies or as input in other types of allocation bases .
Here are some examples of typical statistical dimension members .
&#124; Shared Statistical elements &#124; FTE &#124; Full time employees &#124; Ea . &#124;
&#124; Shared Statistical elements &#124; Pack CC &#124; Packaging Cost center &#124; Hrs . &#124;
The definition of a statistical measure provider template is generic and can be reused in multiple statistical dimension members .
&gt; All tables that contain financial dimensions can be used as sources for statistical measures .
* * Example : Count of employees per cost center * *
The count of employees per cost center is a statistical measure that can be used for various purposes that provide managerial insight :
- A statistical reporting measure by cost center
- An allocation base for various types of expenses
- Internal cost rates by cost center :
- Cost by employee
- Revenue by employee
The HcmEmployment table holds a list of all employees in the instance . This table is a global table . Therefore , the records aren &apos;t related to a specific data area ID .
Here is an example of employees in the HcmEmployment table .
# # Using the Count function
For example , a statistical measure provider template can be set up as follows .
&#124; Name &#124; Data connector &#124; Statistical dimension member &#124;
&#124; Statistical template name &#124;
After the source data for the statistical measure is processed , the following statistical entries are created in Cost accounting .
* * Statistical entry transfer journal entries * *
If the FTEs predefined dimension member allocation basis is assigned as an allocation base in a cost distribution rule , the cost will be distributed by using the following allocation factor .
# # Using the Sum function
The ProdRouteTrans table holds all production labor transactions per legal entity DataAreadID .
Here is an example of the ProdRouteTrans table .
The statistical measure provider template can be set up as follows .
You can also add ranges to narrow the measures from the source table .
The system recognizes that ProdRouteTrans is a table where each record belongs to a separate legal entity . Therefore , you will be asked to select the legal entity that transactions should be imported from .
&#124; Statistical template name &#124; Legal entity &#124;
If the Pack CC predefined dimension member allocation basis is assigned as an allocation base in a cost distribution rule , the cost will be distributed by using the following allocation factor .
&#124; Cost object &#124; Magnitude &#124; Allocation factor &#124;
You can import statistical measures into Cost accounting by using the Data management import / export tool .
The data entity that is used for the import is named Imported statistical measures .
&gt; This data entity is designed to allow a maximum of five unique dimension values per entry .
The consumption of electricity is recorded in Microsoft Excel by using the predefined format of the data entity . Here is an example .
&#124; Electricity &#124; Imported statistical measures &#124; Electricity &#124;
title : Financial dimensions
This topic explains the various types of financial dimensions and how they are set up .
Before you set up financial dimensions as legal entities , evaluate your business processes in the following areas to determine whether this setup will work for your organization :
- Sales and purchases between financial dimensions and legal entities
- Sales tax calculation and reporting
Here are some of the limitations :
- You can use sales tax functionality only with legal entities , not with financial dimensions .
To help maintain referential integrity of the data , financial dimensions can rarely be deleted . If you try to delete a financial dimension , the following criteria are evaluated :
- Has the financial dimension been used on any posted or unposted transactions , or in any type of dimension value combination ?
- Is the financial dimension used in any active account structure , advanced rule structure , or financial dimension set ?
- Is the financial dimension part of a default financial dimension integration format ?
- Has the financial dimension been set up as a default dimension ?
If any of the criteria are met , you can &apos;t delete the financial dimension .
# # Default dimension values
If records already exist for the dimension , the master records are updated when you turn the feature on . However , existing documents and transactions aren &apos;t updated .
You can set up derived values on the dimensions page .
2 . Add the segments that should be derived . Each segment appears as a column .
# # # Overriding existing values with derived dimensions
# # # Preventing changes with derived dimensions
You can set up the derived dimensions segments and values by using entities .
- The Derived dimensions entity sets up the driving dimensions and the segments that are used for those dimensions .
- The Derived dimensions value entity lets you import the values that should be derived for each driving dimension .
When you use an entity to import data , if that entity imports dimensions , the derived dimension rules are applied during the import unless the entity specifically overrides those dimensions .

# 125 percent reducing balance depreciation
This article gives an overview of the 125 percent reducing balance method of depreciation .
# # Example of 125 % reducing balance depreciation
title : Reverse charge VAT
To apply the reverse charge , you must complete the following setup .
# # Set up sales tax codes
We recommend that you use separate sales tax codes for sales operations and purchase operations .
# # Set up sales tax groups and item sales tax groups
We recommend that you use separate sales tax groups for sales operations and purchase operations .
# # Set up reverse charge groups
# # Set up reverse charge rules
# # Set up default parameters
# # Reverse charge on a sales invoice
For sales under the Reverse Charge schema , the seller doesn &apos;t charge VAT . Instead , the invoice indicates both the items that are subject to the reverse charge VAT and the total amount of the reverse charge VAT .
For purchases under the Reverse Charge schema , the purchaser who receives the invoice that has the reverse charge acts as a buyer and a seller for VAT accounting purposes .

# # Opening the Dimension based matrix view to show all variants
You can also change the pivot for dimensions by selecting the new dimension to use .
- Sell an individual product variant to a customer by using cash and carry , in-store pickup , or shipment to an address .
The following table provides more information about the additional actions that are available .
The cost roll-up and sales price calculations are known as bill of materials ( BOM ) calculations , and you initiate them from the Calculations page . This topic provides information about BOM calculations .
- Calculate the cost of a manufactured item , and generate an associated item cost record within a costing version .
- Calculate the sales price of a manufactured item , and generate an associated item sales price record within a costing version .
- By default , the calculation quantity is set to the item &apos;s standard order quantity . However , you can override the default value .
- The calculation date or site can be mandated by the costing version , or user-specified values can be set when the date or site isn &apos;t mandated in the costing version .
Other variations in BOM calculations reflect the costing type and restrictions of the costing version :
# # # BOM calculations that use standard costs
- To help guarantee accurate and consistent calculation of standard costs , the explosion mode must be single-level .
# # # BOM calculations that use planned costs
# # BOM calculations that use the fallback principle
The following situations illustrate two uses of the fallback principle :
# # BOM calculation of a suggested sales price
- An order-specific BOM calculation doesn &apos;t generate an item cost record within a costing version . Therefore , the BOM calculation policies aren &apos;t applied when an item cost record is created , or when a cost record is overwritten .
- An order-specific BOM calculation always uses the active cost records for components , cost categories , and indirect cost calculation formulas .

Every project that will be invoiced must be associated with a project contract . The settings for a project contract apply to all projects and subprojects that are associated with that project contract .
# # Funding for project contracts
Some project contracts specify that multiple parties share the responsibility for funding the project costs . Here are some examples :
- A large customer that has multiple divisions requests that funding of a project be split by division .
- Your company shares the costs of a large project with an external organization .
- A road project is co-funded by two municipalities .
- A bridge project is funded by a government grant and a private corporation .
Here are some steps that you can take to make it easier to split the billing among multiple funding sources :
- Specify that all transactions that are entered for a project use the same sales currency as the project contract .
- Set up funding limits , so that a funding source isn &apos;t invoiced more than a specified amount toward a project .
- Select optional start and end dates to define the period when each funding rule is valid .
- Specify the percentage that each funding source is responsible for .
- Specify which funding source is responsible for rounding differences that are caused by funding allocation calculations .
- Set up rules that determine how project costs are invoiced to external customers and charged to internal organizations .
- Record transactions in an on-hold funding account until additional funding can be obtained , or until you decide to bear the costs internally .
To determine which tax group to associate with a transaction , the project is searched for a tax group assignment . If no tax group assignment has been made at the project level , the project contract is searched .
The following table provides scenarios for managing funding allocation among multiple funding sources . These scenarios are based on the following assumptions :
- Priority settings are factored into the allocation of funds before other funding rule criteria are applied .
- No date range has been specified to define the period d when the funding rule is valid .
2 . Continue to use funding source 3 until it is exhausted .
3 . Use funding source 1 after funding source 3 is exhausted .
To accomplish this goal , you must do the following :
- Create the following funding rules :
This setup works because transactions are checked against rules and limits to determine whether any of them apply to the transaction . If no specific rules or limits apply to the transaction , the All transactions rule applies . The All transactions rule matches all transactions .
The following table examines this scenario in more detail .
You can set up the following types of billing rules :
When you are ready to invoice the customer , the amount to invoice for the project is calculated based on the billing rules , and a project invoice proposal is generated .
The following sections provide examples that show how to set up and manage billing rules for a project .
Your organization enters into an agreement to provide a total of five training sessions to a customer ’ s employees at a cost of 10,000 per training session . You invoice the customer after each training session .
When you set up the billing rules for the contract , you use the following values :
- The unit of delivery is one training session .
- The unit price is 10,000 per training session .
- The total number of units is five training sessions .
- You create an invoice for 15,000 ( 15 percent of 100,000 ) and send it to the customer .
When you create a customer invoice for the first time , the invoice amount is automatically calculated based on the following information :
- You create an invoice for 8,667 and send it to the customer .
- Milestone 1 : Collect consumer data – March 31
- Milestone 2 : Analyze consumer data – April 30
The customer agrees to pay your organization 10,000 for the first milestone , 20,000 for the second milestone , and 20,000 for the third milestone .
When you set up the project contract , you agree to bill the customer based on the milestone that has been completed . The billing rule setup includes the following steps :
- Define the project milestones .
- Define the amount to invoice the customer when each milestone is completed .
When you set up the project contract , create a billing rule to add a 10 percent management fee to the consulting hours that are charged to the project .
- 200 hours at 100 per hour = 20,000
- Total invoice amount = 22,000
If fees are taxable to a customer , and you select a sales tax group in the project contract , the sales tax group is automatically entered in a billing rule for fees .
When you set up the project contract , you agree to bill the customer each month for time and materials on the project . You create a billing rule that includes the following information :
- The contract period is six months .
- Consulting time is calculated at a rate of 150 per hour .
- Office supplies are invoiced at cost , and the total cost for the project must not exceed 10,000 .
- You create a customer invoice at the end of each calendar month during the project .

title : Acquire assets through procurement
This topic describes how to set up the integration between Fixed assets and Accounts payable to automatically create fixed assets from purchase orders or vendor invoices , or automatically post acquisition and acquisition adjustment transactions for fixed assets .
The following methods are available for integrating Fixed assets and Accounts payable , and you must use the same method for all fixed assets :
- You manually create a fixed asset before you add the fixed asset number to the line on the purchase order or vendor invoice . No acquisition transaction is posted for the asset when you post the vendor invoice .
- A fixed asset automatically is created when you post a product receipt or vendor invoice that has the Create a new fixed asset check box selected . An acquisition transaction automatically is posted for the asset when you post the vendor invoice .
- A fixed asset automatically is created when you post a product receipt or vendor invoice that has the Create a new fixed asset check box selected . No acquisition transaction is posted for the asset when you post the vendor invoice .
This topic discusses the details of each method .
# # Methods for manually creating fixed assets
If an acquisition cannot be posted , you can either manually enter an acquisition transaction in Fixed assets , or use an acquisition proposal in the Fixed assets journal to create multiple acquisition transactions at the same time .
&gt; If Fixed assets is set up to limit acquisition transaction posting to a specific user group , you must be a member of that user group to post acquisition transactions from invoices .
# # Methods for automatically creating fixed assets
You can set up the capitalization threshold in the Fixed asset groups page .
The following scenario discusses a full cycle of a Fixed assets and Accounts payable integration . A sample setup is shown and the use of acquisition proposals is also described .
In this scenario , the system is set up as follows :
- Assets are automatically created during product receipt or vendor invoice posting , but Fixed assets is set up to prevent posting acquisition transactions from Accounts payable .
- Accounts are specified in the Account type field for the Fixed asset receipt and Fixed asset issue account types in the Item groups page .
The following transactions occurred .
The following are variations for this scenario :
- If the laptop cost is 1,400 instead of 1,600 , the capitalization threshold is not reached . Therefore , the asset is created and the Depreciation option is cleared .

title : Reporting tree definitions in financial reports
This article provides information about reporting tree definitions . A reporting tree definition is a report component , or building block , that helps define the structure and hierarchy of your organization .
# # Reporting tree best practices
Before you create a reporting tree , consider the following best practices :
- First determine which reporting dimensions your legal entity or company requires .
- Consider how you &apos;ve set up your structure , and then draw an organizational chart of your company . The organizational chart will help you visualize how to group the reporting units into one or more reporting trees .
- You can use the reporting units that are defined in your financial data system to add reporting units to the reporting tree definition .
# # Create multiple reporting trees
# # Create a reporting tree definition
A reporting tree definition contains the columns that are described in the following table .
&#124; Reporting tree column &#124; Description &#124;
&#124; External file &#124; The file path of the financial reporting worksheet to pull data from . &#124;
&#124; Page Options &#124; This column controls whether the details for the reporting unit are suppressed when the report is viewed or printed . &#124;
&#124; Additional Text &#124; Text that is included on the report . &#124;
# # # Open an existing reporting tree definition
2 . Double-click a name in the reporting tree list to open it .
- In a reporting tree , child units must contain dimensions , unless the reporting tree is a single-level tree . Parent units usually don &apos;t contain dimensions in a reporting tree .
&gt; If you specify dimensions for both child units and parent units , you might cause duplication of data in the report .
# # # Manage reporting units
# # # Reporting unit structure
The following types of reporting units are used in financial reporting :
- A detail unit draws information directly from the financial data , from an Excel worksheet , or from another financial reporting worksheet .
- A summary unit summarizes data from lower-level units .
# # # Organize reporting units
You can rearrange the organizational structure of a reporting tree definition by moving reporting units in the graphical view . You can also promote reporting units to a higher level in the reporting tree or demote them to a lower level .

title : Posting definitions in the public sector
# Posting definitions in the public sector
This article describes the posting definitions functionality available for the public sector . Before you read this topic , you should be familiar with posting definitions .
# # How do I use these examples of public sector posting definitions ?
- Posting definition – Match criteria
- Posting definition – Generated entries
- Transactions with the accounts , dimension values , and amounts
- Ledger entries generated from the posting definition
# # Example : Budget appropriations
&#124; Account structure &#124; Generated account number &#124; Generated debit / credit &#124;
# # # Transactions with the accounts , dimension values , and amounts
# # # Ledger entries generated from the posting definition
Generated ledger entries are created to record the original budget in each dimension .
# # Examples : Pooled cash settlements
You can use posting definitions for the following settlement transaction types :
- Vendor payment journals , which include vendor payments against invoices , reimbursements , and general ledger credit vouchers and credit memos against invoices
You can specify a different posting definition for a specific bank and method of payment for vendor and customer payment journals .
Before posting definitions are applied on settlements , you should complete the following tasks :
- Associate the Treasurer ’ s fund with each bank account that is used in settlements . The posted bank account can then be in balance , by fund , with the vendor or customer payment .
You should also complete one of the following tasks :
# # # # Settlement posting definition – Match criteria
The following vouchers are representative of a typical invoice , payment , and settlement scenario .
# # # Accounts payable invoice voucher
# # # Accounts payable payment voucher
# # # Accounts payable settlement voucher
The accounts payable settlement voucher is accessed through the related vouchers on the vendor payment voucher .
# # # Summarizing the entries across the invoice , payment , and settlement vouchers
The following table shows how the final ledger accounts are affected .
# # # Accounts receivable invoice voucher
# # # Accounts receivable payment voucher
# # # Accounts receivable settlement voucher
The accounts receivable settlement voucher is accessed through the related vouchers on the customer payment voucher .
In addition to the example earlier in this section , posting definitions for settlements that are associated with the customer payment journal transaction type can also be applied in the following scenarios :
- Accounts receivable write-offs
- Accounts receivable free text invoice cash-on-delivery ( cash payment ) settlements
# # # Posting definition – Generated entries for match criteria
# # Accounts receivable writeoff example
# # # Accounts receivable write-off – General ledger credit voucher
In this example , the posting definition for write-off is set to reverse the revenue account .
# # # Accounts receivable write-off – Settlement voucher
# # # Summarizing the entries across the invoice , write-off credit , and settlement vouchers
There is no net effect on the ledger accounts after an invoice is written off in full .
# # Accounts receivable free text invoice cash-on-delivery ( cash payment ) settlement example
To use posting definitions for settlement in this scenario , complete the following additional setup tasks :
- Create a distinct method of payment for free text invoices that will be settled through this method .
- Create a new posting definition for the free text invoice cash-on-delivery settlement .
Then , in the posting definition , enter the following match criteria and generated entries for the Treasurer ’ s fund ( 999 ) .
# # Accounts receivable cashondelivery ( cash payment ) settlement example
This includes additional credit entries in the voucher .
# # Example : Advanced ledger entries
# # Examples : General ledger year-end close
&gt; To use posting definitions for year-end closing and opening , you need to complete the following setup tasks :
The following posting definition examples show the year-end close for governmental funds and proprietary funds .
The ledger accounts balance through the selected period appears on the * * Opening transactions * * page .
Generated ledger entries are created to record the closing entry .

title : Fixed assets integration
In the inventory journal for fixed assets , you can enter the acquisition of fixed assets that the legal entity has produced or constructed for itself . You can then transfer inventory items to fixed assets either as an acquisition or as part of an acquisition .
If you use specific receipt and issue accounts on item groups for fixed assets , you can use the same inventory item both for internal purchases and as stock for resale .
- The invoice line contains an existing fixed asset for internal purposes .
The accounts that fixed asset transactions are posted to depend on two factors : whether the assets are purchased or constructed by the legal entity , and the transaction type of the asset .
If the book includes a derived book , the derived book transaction is created when you post the customer invoice .
If the book includes a derived book , the derived book transaction is created when you post the vendor invoice .
# # Project management and accounting
You can also designate a fixed asset that you ’ re creating or manufacturing as part of an estimate project . At the end of an estimate project , you can automatically post an asset acquisition transaction .

Vendor rebates help companies better manage their supplier rebate programs by automating tasks that are required in order to administer , track , and claim rebates that are earned .
This topic provides an overview of the most common tasks that you might want to perform when you work with vendor rebates . The overview covers the following tasks :
- Identify orders that qualify for rebates , and generate rebate claims .
- Review and approve claims .
- Negotiate vendor price , discount , and rebate agreements .
- Manage staff that processes rebate claims and collects payments .
- Order inventory at the best possible prices .
People in these positions are looking for ways to achieve various goals . Here are some examples :
- Flexibly accommodate different types of vendor promotion programs and rebate conditions .
- Reduce the administrative burden and errors that are associated with monitoring promotion performance and processing claims .
- Improve cash flow forecasts by accruing for future receivables .
- Have a quantified basis for ongoing and future negotiations with vendors about rebates .
# # Review details of a vendor rebate agreement
On the agreement lines , you can specify the vendor rebate agreement in more detail .
# # Identify orders that qualify for rebates , and generate rebate claims
# # # View details of rebates that are applied to a purchase order line per the vendor rebate agreement
# # Review and approve claims
# # # The status of claims and the effect on the approval process
# # # Approve claims , and view postings and invoice details
2 . Close the rebate claim .
A Rebate accrual journal is posted for the claim amount . This posting debits the Accrued Vendor Rebates Receivable account for the expected vendor credit and credits the interim Accrued Vendor Rebates Received account for the expected gain .
- A Rebate accrual journal posting has reversed the previous interim amounts on the accrual receivable and expense accounts .
- A vendor invoice ( credit note ) for the rebate amount has been created .
- When the vendor invoice is posted , either automatically or manually , the vendor ’ s Payable account has been debited , and the Discounts and Allowances Received account has been credited .
The process for handling vendor rebates involves multiple manual tracking tasks that are often tedious . By automating these tasks , the vendor rebate management feature can help you move through the following processes :
- Generating accurate rebate claims
- Accruing the expected receivable and interim gain in the general ledger
- Updating the vendor balance and the income statement with the allowance that is due

This topic describes the statuses that a purchase order ( PO ) goes through after it has been created , and the effect of enabling change management on POs .
# # Approval of purchase orders
&#124; Approval status &#124; Description &#124; Request change is enabled &#124;
&#124; Rejected &#124; The PO was rejected during the approval process . &#124; No &#124;
&#124; Approved &#124; The PO was approved . &#124; Yes &#124;
There is also an option to generate a pro-forma confirmation for an order before the actual confirmation has been processed . This option just creates a report that you can share with the vendor . It doesn ’ t create any journal information .
After an order has been confirmed , you can no longer delete it . However , you can cancel the total quantity or any remaining quantity on an order , provided that the quantity hasn ’ t been received or invoiced .
This article provides information about different types of postings in the production process .
Production posting activities follow production processes that are described in the sections below .
# # Reporting finished goods and error quantities
# # Ending the production order

# Configure call center delivery modes and charges
# # Validate delivery modes for a call center order
# # Define charges for delivery services
# # Apply delivery modes during order entry in a call center
# # Calculation of delivery charges during entry of order
# # Use expedited delivery modes on call center orders
title : Project cost accrual on purchase receipts
# Project cost accrual on purchase receipts
The following example scenario illustrates this .
Using this same scenario , let &apos;s see how posting a product receipt will impact General ledger and Project information .
When the purchase order is confirmed , transactions for the committed cost are created for the project .
Posting a product receipt will generate and post a voucher to the ledger . The voucher will debit the purchase expenditure , un-invoiced account , and credit purchase accrual account .
&gt; Posting a product receipt will use the posting setup for procurement categories and products , and not the posting setup for the project categories . In order to correctly reflect financial impact of purchase accruals , this setup needs to be aligned .
It is possible to map procurement categories to project categories on the * * Procurement category * * page .
Creating a draft vendor invoice will generate pending project transactions .
The vendor invoice will remain in a pending state until the actual vendor invoice arrives .

# Change the service order stage
Follow these steps to move a service order to the next stage in the service workflow or revert it to a previous stage .
Purchase agreements can apply to a specific quantity of a product , a specific currency amount of a product , or a specific currency amount of the products in a procurement category . The prices and discounts of the purchase agreement override the prices and discounts that are specified in any trade agreements that exist .
Each line in a purchase agreement is a commitment to buy something . You can use lines from multiple purchase orders ( POs ) to fulfill the commitment . There are four types of commitments :
# # Pricing terms for purchase agreements
# # Policies for purchase agreements
The following policies affect the way that the link between a purchase agreement commitment and the corresponding PO lines works :
# # Fulfillment calculations for purchase agreements
The * * Fulfillment * * area shows the remaining amount or quantity that is required to fulfill the commitment .
You can access the PO lines and the invoice lines that contribute to the fulfillment calculation by selecting the * * Related information * * action on the lines or on the header of a purchase agreement .
# # Confirmations and version history for purchase agreements
# # Applying purchase agreements in the ordering process
You can select a purchase agreement only when you &apos;re creating a PO . You can &apos;t select a purchase agreement after the PO has been created .
# # Purchase agreements and intercompany trade
You can create a purchase agreement or sales agreement for one of the intercompany trading parties . You can then generate the corresponding sales agreement or purchase agreement for the other intercompany trading party in the other legal entity .
If you create an intercompany PO that uses the intercompany purchase agreement in one legal entity , the corresponding intercompany sales order uses the corresponding intercompany sales agreement in the other legal entity . The fulfillment of the sales agreement commitments and the fulfillment of the purchase agreements are synchronized , just as the intercompany sales order and the intercompany PO are synchronized .

title : Accruing subscriptions
With service subscriptions , you manually accrue revenue in the periods following the date when you invoiced a fee transaction .
Accrual periods are created for the invoice period that you set up for the subscription fee , and the accrual periods are based on the period code of the subscription .
You can accrue and reverse accrued revenue .
# # Reverse accruals of credit amounts
If you credit invoiced subscription amounts , you can use two methods to reverse the accrual amounts :
- You can have the accrued amounts reversed on the date where the credit note is posted or on the original posting date of the accrual .
# # Set up accounts for accrual of subscription revenue
# # Enable revenue accrual on a subscription group
You must set up an invoicing period code . Unless you want to accrue revenue in the same time intervals as you use for invoicing , you must also set up an accrual period .

title : Trade allowance management
This article will provide a broad overview of the Trade allowance management feature and will familiarize you with the typical set of tasks that are involved in managing a sales promotion program . Several types of users who have operational and decision making responsibilities are expected to use this functionality to achieve their respective goals :
- Running the negotiated promotion contracts through ongoing sales and generating bill-back claims
- Calculating , approving , and processing the generated claims , and passing them on to Accounts receivable ( A / R ) as deductions for payment settlement
- Reconciling the customer ’ s short-pay with the deduction that is due
- High-level budgets and fund allocation
- Planning and analyzing sales promotions
- Managing staff that processes bill-back claims , runs payments based on merchandizing events , and settles short-pays and deductions
People in these roles are looking for ways to achieve these goals :
- Better use marketing promotional funds .
- Flexibly accommodate different types of promotion programs and allowances .
- Improve cash flow forecasts by accruing for future liability .
- Have a quantified basis for ongoing and future negotiations with customers about promotions .

# # Perform sales under the planned merchandising event and generate bill-back claims
When the sales invoice is posted , a corresponding bill-back claim is generated for each invoice line .
# # Process claims and pass them as deductions to A / R
The next steps in the process for handling bill-backs are to review , calculate , and approve claims , and then convert them into deductions .
# # # Process claims and pass them to A / R
- The rebate accrual account has been credited to represent the future liability for the customer .
- The rebate expense account has been debited to recognize the cost that was incurred in connection with the sales .
To complete the process , the A / R clerk must now handle the accrual deductions by transferring them to the customers balance as a credit note ( liability ) .
- The customer &apos;s receivable account has been credited .
- The rebate accrual account has been debited .
# # Settle the deduction that is due and the customer short-pay by using the Deduction workbench
The collection manager is now responsible for settling the open credit note transaction and the short-pay transaction against each other in the Deduction workbench .
The status of the originating claims is now set to * * Completed * * .
# # Analyze the effectiveness of the promotion and fund consumption
To get an overview of the program &apos;s key statistics and fund use , you can use several reports and analytical views that are available in Trade allowance management .

This topic provides information about dimension hierarchies . You use a dimension hierarchy to define the reporting structure , cost policies , and security setup in Cost accounting .
Dimension hierarchies are used in various places in Cost accounting . A dimension hierarchy lets you define the following information :
- The reporting structure that fits into the organization &apos;s requirements
Here is an example of a dimension hierarchy .
A dimension hierarchy can be created for the following types of dimensions :
- Cost element dimensions
- Cost object dimensions
&gt; - A dimension hierarchy can be associated with only one dimension .
# # Dimension hierarchy type
# # # Dimension categorization hierarchy
- You can put a cost element dimension member in different nodes by assigning a cost behavior to the leaf node .
# # # Dimension classification hierarchy
# # Create and maintain a dimension hierarchy
A dimension hierarchy is created as a tree structure that has node and leaf node relationships .
- A node can ’ t have both subnodes and leaf nodes assigned to it .
- A leaf node can be assigned only at the lowest level in the hierarchy .
A small company has the following organization structure , where Finance and Human resources are departments under Admin , and Assembly and Packaging are departments under Production .
A cost object dimension represents all the cost centers in the organization .
- Cost object dimension
The cost object dimension that represents all the cost centers can be set up as shown here .
A cost element dimension represents all the cost elements in the organization .
- Cost element dimension
The cost element dimension that represents all the cost elements can be set up as shown here .
A dimension hierarchy that meets the organizational reporting requirements can be set up as shown here .
&#124; Organization &#124; Cost centers &#124; Dimension classification hierarchy &#124; No &#124;
The dimension hierarchy for reporting can be set up as shown here .
A dimension hierarchy that meets the policy requirement can be set up as shown here .
&#124; Cost behavior &#124; Cost elements &#124; Dimension classification hierarchy &#124;
The dimension hierarchy for the policy can be set up as shown here .
You can copy a current dimension hierarchy as the starting point for a new dimension hierarchy . This approach can be useful if you want to compare the previous dimension hierarchy to the new dimension hierarchy .
# # # Rearrange nodes in a hierarchy
# # Define dimension hierarchies for reporting
Dimension hierarchies are available in the following reporting tools . This approach helps guarantee consistency in the reporting structure .
- Controlled by configuration .
- Provides the option to select specific dimension hierarchies per export definition :
- One cost element dimension hierarchy ( mandatory )
- One cost object dimension hierarchy ( optional )
- One statistical dimension hierarchy ( optional )
- All dimension hierarchies are available .
The following example shows what a dimension hierarchy might look like in the reporting structure .
# # # Update the dimension hierarchies that are used for reporting
Over time , the dimension hierarchies that are used in the previously mentioned reporting tools will have to be updated . You can update dimension hierarchies by refreshing the client .
# # Define dimension hierarchies for cost policies
Cost accounting consists of multiple policies where detailed rules are defined . You must define one or more dimension hierarchies for the following policies :
- Cost behavior
A new cost behavior policy is created , and appropriate dimension hierarchies are assigned to the policy , as shown here .
* * Cost behavior policy * *
&#124; Policy name &#124; Cost element dimension hierarchy &#124; Cost object dimension hierarchy &#124; Accounting currency &#124;
If the dimension hierarchies that are used in rules are updated , the system automatically brings the updates forward .
If a level of granularity in the rules is no longer required , the rule can be expired .
Any overhead calculation that is run after January 20 , 2017 , no longer considers this rule .
# # Define dimension hierarchies for security setup
Cost accounting data should be made available to all managers who are responsible for a reporting unit . In Cost accounting terminology , a reporting unit is represented as a cost object or a set of cost objects .
- The use of dimension hierarchies applies only when the dimension value that is selected in the dimension hierarchy reference is a cost object dimension .
- Only one dimension hierarchy can be enabled per cost object dimension in the access list hierarchy .
&gt; Cost accountants should be assigned to the top level of the hierarchy , so that they can see all entries in Cost accounting .
The settings for the access list hierarchy are used to control the data that is shown in the following areas :
- Data in forms that are used to drill through scenarios
- Balances in cards
- Data that is shown in Power BI visualizations

&#124; Month &#124; Number of pieces ordered &#124;
# # Example 3 : Transactions dynamic period forecast reduction principle
1 . Create a demand forecast for the following dates and quantities .
&#124; January 1 &#124; 1,000 &#124;
&#124; January 12 &#124; 1,000 &#124;
In this forecast , there isn &apos;t a clear period between the forecast dates : between the first and second dates there is a four-day span , and between the second and third dates there is a seven-day span . These various spans are the dynamic periods .
2 . Create sales order lines as follows .
&#124; Date &#124; Sales order quantity &#124;
&#124; December 15 in the previous year &#124; 500 &#124;
The forecast will be reduced as follows :
- The first sales order isn &apos;t within any period , so it won &apos;t reduce any forecast .
The following planned order will be created to fulfill the forecast .
&#124; Demand forecast date &#124; Reduced quantity &#124;
- Forecast requirements are reduced by the actual order transactions that occur during the dynamic period . The dynamic period covers the current forecast dates and ends at the start of the next forecast .
- This method doesn &apos;t use or require a reduction key .
- When this option is used , the following behavior occurs :
- If there is no future forecast , forecast requirements from the last forecast that was entered are reduced .
- Time fences are included in the forecast reduction calculation .
- Positive days are included in the forecast reduction calculation .
- If actual order transactions exceed the forecasted requirements , the remaining transactions aren &apos;t forwarded to the next forecast period .

title : Moving average
When you use moving average , inventory settlements and inventory marking are not supported . Inventory close does not affect products that have moving average as the inventory model group , and it does not generate any settlements between the transactions .
The following are prerequisites when you use moving average cost as a costing method .
# # Convert to the moving average costing method
If you are changing your costing method from a standard costing method to a moving average method , you have to complete the following tasks :
3 . Make adjustments to get the quantity and value back into inventory .
* * Note : * * Converting from standard cost to moving weighted average is a manual process .
The following examples illustrate the effect of using the moving average costing method . There are four configurations :
- Purchase order and proportionally expensed cost difference
- Moving average product and inventory adjustment
- Moving average with production
- Moving average with a backdated transaction
# # Purchase order and proportionally expensed cost difference
In this example , a purchase order is created and received at one cost , and the purchase invoice is posted with a different cost .
2 . Create a purchase receipt of the product .
3 . Create a sales order for a quantity of 1 and a unit price of 10.00 .
4 . Create a purchase invoice for a quantity of 2 and a unit price of 12.00 .
# # Moving average product and inventory adjustment
If you need to adjust the moving average cost of a product , inventory adjustments are allowed as of today ’ s date . You cannot backdate an inventory adjustment to correct the moving average cost of a product . You cannot have the cost flow through subsequent transactions .
In this example , the moving average cost is adjusted for a product .
3 . The adjustment is posted .
* * Note : * * You can only adjust the moving average cost as of today ’ s date .
# # Moving average with production
# # Moving average with a backdated transaction

- First ordered , first delivered , which means that customers get available items in the same order in which they place their orders .
- Shortage of items due to a long or unknown delivery time from the vendor . You might want to make sure that certain customers or orders get delivery of the first-available items .
- Certain customers and certain types of orders have first priority for delivery .
- Items with serial or batch numbers . You can mark certain items that have been or will be delivered to specific orders .
- Specially ordered items that are reserved for certain orders .
- Production orders . For example , you can mark items that are produced for and adjusted to specific orders .

- Make main account first or as close to the front of the account structure as possible , so users get the best guided experience they can during account entry .
- Reuse account structures as much as possible to reduce maintenance across your legal entities .
- For variations across legal entities , consider using advanced rules so that account structures can be reused .
- When defining allowed values , use ranges and wildcards as much as possible . This not only allows you to grow and change without maintenance , but the system also performs more ideally with this configuration .
- Do not just put an asterisk for every segment in the account structure and then solely rely on the advanced rules . This can be difficult to manage and often leads to user error during maintenance that can make the system unable to post .

title : Shift and cash drawer management
# Shift and cash drawer management
This topic explains how to set up and use shifts in retail point of sale ( POS ) .
&gt; Only one shared shift can be open at a time in each store . Shared shifts and stand-alone shifts can be used in the same store .
# # Shift and drawer operations
The POS requires that users have an active , open shift in order to perform any operations that will produce a financial transaction , such as a sale , return , or customer order .
# # # Declare start amount
* Float entries * are non-sales transactions that are performed in an active shift to increase the amount of cash in the cash drawer . A typical example of a float entry is a transaction to add additional change to the drawer when it &apos;s running low .
Suspension of a shift prevents any new transactions or changes to the shift until it &apos;s resumed .
This operation lets users resume a previously suspended shift on any register that doesn &apos;t already have an active shift .
This operation is performed to specify the total amount of money that is currently in the cash drawer . Users most often perform this operation before they close a shift . The specified amount is compared against the expected shift amount to calculate the overage / shortage amount .
Like safe drops , bank drops are done on active shifts . This operation removes money from the shift to prepare for the bank deposit .
Blind-closed shifts are often used to free up a register for a new user or shift without first having to fully count , reconcile , and close the shift .
This operation generates and prints an X report for the current active shift .
This operation reprints the last Z report that the system generated when a shift was closed .
The following POS permissions affect what a user can and can &apos;t do in various scenarios :
Although every retailer has different business requirements , we recommend that you set up your system in the following way to avoid situations where differences of this type occur :

title : Service level agreements
A service level agreement ( SLA ) is an agreement between a service company and a service customer . In a SLA , the customer agrees to a minimum response time based on when the service company records the issue and when the issue is resolved .
A SLA enforces a standard level of service that is offered to customers , and also makes it transparent to a service company when a service job should be completed .
Any number of SLAs can be created to offer service customers different levels of service .

You can use flex groups to set the following rules and principles for a worker &apos;s flexible hours :
- Rules for flex regulations
- Principle for calculating the worker &apos;s flex balance
# # Set up flexible working hours in flex groups
# # Associate workers with flex groups
# # Rules for flex regulations
If the worker &apos;s allowed flex maximum is exceeded , you can use these methods to adjust the worker &apos;s flex balance by making a flex regulation :
- The worker &apos;s flex account can be adjusted back to the specified allowed maximum , but without compensating the worker &apos;s pay for the number of hours that the worker worked above the allowed maximum .
- The number of hours that the worker worked above the allowed maximum can be converted to pay . This conversion is done by generating pay items for a specific pay type .
You can adjust a flex balance at the following times :
# # Principle for calculating a worker &apos;s flex balance
The following two principles can be used :
A worker who can work flexible hours has a negative flex account .
The worker is associated with a flex group that has the following configuration :
As the difference between the worker &apos;s flex account and his allowed flex minimum indicates , the worker has exceeded his allowed flex minimum by 3.5 hours .
- The worker &apos;s flex account is adjusted by 3.5 hours . Therefore , the flex balance of -4.0 hours becomes adjusted to the worker &apos;s allowed flex minimum of -0.5 hours .
A worker who can work flexible hours has a positive flex account .
As the difference between the worker &apos;s flex account and her allowed flex maximum indicates , the worker has exceeded her allowed flex maximum by 4.0 hours .
- The worker &apos;s flex account is adjusted by -4.0 hours . Therefore , the flex balance of 6.0 hours becomes adjusted to the worker &apos;s allowed flex maximum of 2.0 hours .
Next , follow these steps to set up a pay type and add lines of the new type to a pay profile .
The worker enters the following registrations for the day .
When you transfer the registrations , you will notice that the amount of Flex + time is changed from 6.0 hours to 8.0 hours .
This change occurs after the transfer because the flexible hours have been calculated based on pay types instead of time . The following table shows how the eight hours are calculated .
title : Sales tax overview
This topic provides an overview of the sales tax system . It explains the elements of the sales tax setup and how they work together .
The following diagram shows the entities of the tax setup and how they are related .
Every sales tax code must also be linked to a ledger posting group . A ledger posting group specifies the main accounts that amounts for the sales tax codes will be posted to .
The following table describes the entities and the sequence for the tax setup .
&#124; Setup activity &#124; Required / Optional and description &#124;
# # Sales tax on transactions
# # Sales tax settlement and reporting
After the sales tax has been paid , the balance on the sales tax settlement account should be balanced against the bank account . If the sales tax authority that is specified on the sales tax settlement period is related to a vendor account , the sales tax balance is posted as an open vendor invoice and can be included in the regular payment proposal .
&gt; When you select the Conditional sales tax check box , you must set up sales tax codes and sales tax groups , and also create ledger posting groups , to support the functionality . &#124;
You settle sales taxes each month . On June 15 , you create a customer invoice of 10,000 , plus sales tax .
- The sales tax is 25 percent , or 2,500 .
- The invoice payment is due July 30 .
You typically would have to settle and pay 2,500 to the tax authority when the invoice is posted in June , even though you have not received the payment from the customer .
However , if you are using a conditional sales tax , you settle with the tax authority when you receive the payment from the customer on July 30 .

Budget planning workflows are used together with Budgeting workflows to manage the creation and evolution of budget plans .
The workflow includes elements for allocation to sales departments and aggregation of their submissions , review by the budget manager , approval by the CFO , and stage transitions between each stage .
# # # Parameters , scenarios , and stages
The initial settings on the * * Budget planning configuration * * page let you create some building blocks for later configuration steps :
In budget planning , you can allocate the amounts or quantities on budget plan lines from one scenario to another scenario , or even to the same scenario . For example , you might allocate to the same scenario if you want to apply changes to the financial dimensions or the dates of the amounts in that scenario . An allocation can be done within a budget plan or from one budget plan to another .
Stage allocations are used to automatically allocate budget plan lines during workflow processing . When stage allocations are used , budget plan lines in the destination scenario can be created and modified without the intervention of the budget plan preparer or reviewer .
In the example schema that appears earlier in this article , an allocation is performed to transfer amounts from a budget plan and scenarios in the headquarters Baseline stage to another budget plan and scenarios in the Sales department Estimate stage . The following illustration shows the relevant section of the example schema .
Additionally , in the example schema , an aggregation is done from budget plans and scenarios in the Sales department Submitted stage to a parent plan in the HQ Rollup stage . The following illustration shows the relevant section of the example schema .
# # # Columns and layouts
Budget figures appear on a budget plan in rows and columns . You must first define the columns , and then you can create a layout to define the presentation of the columns .

title : Sales tax payments and rounding rules
# Sales tax payments and rounding rules
This article explains how the rounding rule setup on the Sales tax authorities works and rounding the sales tax balance during the Settle and post sales tax job .
The below example illustrates how the rounding rule on Sales tax authority works .
The total sales tax for a period shows a credit balance of -98,765.43 . The legal entity collected more sales taxes than it paid . Therefore , the legal entity owes money to the tax authority .
The legal entity wants to use a rounding method that rounds the balance to the nearest 1.00 . The user who is responsible for sales tax accounting performs the following steps .
2 . On the General FastTab , select Normal in the Rounding form field .
3 . In the Round-off field , enter 1.00 .
5 . On the sales tax settlement account , the tax liability amount of 98,765.43 is rounded to 98,765 .
The following table shows how an amount of 98,765.43 is rounded by using each rounding method that is available in the Rounding form field in the Sales tax authorities page .
&gt; If you select Own advantage , the rounding is always to the advantage of the legal entity .
Delivery schedules allow you to track order line quantity when you are using multiple deliveries for a single sales order , sales quotation , or purchase order .
* * Example of a delivery schedule * *
&#124; Requested delivery schedule &#124; 100 chairs per month &#124;
Orders that have a delivery schedule are processed against the delivery lines . Processing includes the posting of packing slips , product receipts , and invoicing .

There are three ways to attach Time and material projects and Fixed-price projects to the invoice projects :
# # # Creating invoice proposals
You can create invoice proposals for the following transactions :
- Hours , expenses , and other project transactions
- Amounts that are withheld by customers on previous project invoices
# # # Creating customer invoices from invoice proposals
After you create and post an invoice proposal , a customer invoice is automatically created for the transactions that are included in the invoice proposal .
Before you post an invoice proposal , you can add transactions to it or delete transactions from it . For example , you can remove expense transactions that were posted to a project , but that are not chargeable to the customer .
# # # Time and material projects
To invoice a Fixed-price project , you must define a billing schedule and complete the invoicing procedure .
For example , you can set up the following billing schedule :
- 20 percent when the project contract is signed
- 30 percent on first delivery
- 15 percent on second delivery
- 35 percent on final delivery
When the milestone payments are ready to be invoiced , you use the procedure for invoicing on-account amounts .
To credit an invoiced amount , you first select the invoiced amount to credit and then create a credit note . You create a credit note by following the same procedure that you would use to generate a customer invoice .

title : Batch processing of alerts
Finance and Operations supports two types of events :
- Events that are triggered by change-based events . These events are also referred to as create / delete and update events .
- Events that are triggered by due dates .
You can set up batch processes for each type of event .

title : Weighted average date
The following formula is used to calculate the weighted average date costing method :
During inventory close , the calculation is performed every day through the closing period , as shown in the following illustration .
- Direct settlement
- Summarized settlement
Settlements are inventory close postings that adjust the issues to the correct weighted average as of the closing date .
- Weighted average date direct settlement when the * * Include physical value * * option isn &apos;t used
- Weighted average date summarized settlement when the * * Include physical value * * option isn &apos;t used
- Weighted average date direct settlement when the * * Include physical value * * option is used
- Weighted average date summarized settlement when the * * Include physical value * * option is used
- Weighted average date when marking is used
# # Weighted average date direct settlement when the Include physical value option isn &apos;t used
The current version uses the same direct settlement principle that was used for weighted average in earlier versions . The system settles directly between receipts and issues . The system uses this direct settlement principle in specific situations :
- One receipt and one or several issues have been posted in the period .
In the following scenario , a financially updated receipt and issue have been posted . During inventory close , the system settles the receipt directly against the issue , and no adjustment to the cost price is required on issue .
The following illustration shows these transactions :
- 3 . Inventory close is performed by using the direct settlement method to settle the inventory financial receipt to the inventory financial issue .
- If an inventory transaction value is enclosed in parentheses , the inventory transaction is physically posted into inventory .
- If an inventory transaction value isn &apos;t enclosed in parentheses , the inventory transaction is financially posted into inventory .
- Settlements that are performed by inventory close are represented by dashed red arrows that go diagonally from a receipt to an issue .
# # Weighted average date summarized settlement when the Include physical value option isn &apos;t used
In the following scenario , several financially updated receipts and issues have been posted during the period . During inventory close , the system evaluates every day to determine how each day should be treated by closing .
The system will use the direct settlement approach for day 1 .
The system will use the direct settlement approach for day 2 .
Inventory close is performed . The direct settlement must be used , because there are multiple receipts that cross multiple days .
- 7b . A weighted average inventory close transaction financial receipt is created as the offset to 7a .
- Solid red diagonal arrows show the receipt transactions being settled to the issue transaction that is created by the system .
- The solid green diagonal arrow represents the offsetting system-generated receipt transaction that the originally posted issue transaction is settled to .
# # Weighted average date direct settlement when the Include physical value option is used
The current version uses the same direct settlement principle for weighted average date that is used in earlier versions . The system settles directly between receipts and issues . The system uses this direct settlement principle in specific situations :
- Only issues have been posted in the period , and the inventory contains on-hand inventory from a previous closing .

title : Overhead calculation
This topic describes the typical processes for calculating and allocating overhead costs .
- Date and time
- Cost accounting ledger
# # Calculate and allocate the Electricity overhead cost
# # # Step 1 : Process the cost behavior calculation
# # # # Define the cost behavior rule
- Fixed amount 1,000.00
# # # # # Journal
# # # # # Cost entries
# # # Step 2 : Process the cost distribution calculation
Cost distribution is used to redistribute cost from one cost object to one or more other cost objects by applying a relevant allocation base . Cost distribution and cost allocation differ in that cost distribution always occurs at the level of the primary cost element of the original cost .
# # # # Define the cost distribution rule
# # # Step 3 : Process the overhead rate calculation
The overhead rate is used to charge one or more specific cost objects . The charge is based on a predetermined cost rate and the magnitude from the assigned allocation base .
# # # # Define the overhead rate
Cost object CC001 HR contributes to a set of internal projects . A statistical dimension member that is named HR projects is created to measure the consumed magnitude .
A predetermined cost rate for the cost projects contribution has been defined .
The following table shows the result when the HR projects are applied as an allocation base .
# # # Step 4 : Process the cost allocation calculation
# # # # Define the cost allocation
Here is a simple example that explains how you can trace the flow of cost . Cost object CC001 HR contributes to several cost objects . A statistical dimension member that is named HR services is created to measure the consumed magnitude .
Cost object CC002 Finance contributes to several cost objects . A statistical dimension member that is named Finance services is created to measure the consumed magnitude .
Cost object CC003 Assembly contributes to several cost objects . A statistical dimension member that is named Assembly services is created to measure the consumed magnitude .
Cost object CC004 Packaging contributes to several cost objects . A statistical dimension member that is named Packaging services is created to measure the consumed magnitude .
The following table shows the result when the Finance services are applied as an allocation base for total cost ( fixed cost and variable cost ) .
The following table shows the result when the Assembly services are applied as an allocation base for total cost ( fixed cost and variable cost ) .
The following table shows the result when the Packaging services are applied as an allocation base for total cost ( fixed cost and variable cost ) .

This topic provides information about operations scheduling . You can use operations scheduling to provide a general estimate of the production process over time .
# # Components of operations scheduling
The main components of operations scheduling are the scheduling direction , the capacity of resources , and materials optimization . By using operations scheduling , you can achieve the following goals :
- Control the planning method by scheduling forward or backward from a given date .
- Optimize the use of resources by scheduling productions based on the capacity of the resources . This approach also helps identify when alternative resources should be used .
- Optimize the use of materials by scheduling productions based on the availability of the required materials .
- Schedule and synchronize reference productions . The dates of the reference productions are adjusted when the production order ’ s schedule is changed .
You must estimate the cost of a production order before you can run operations scheduling . If you haven &apos;t run an estimate , it &apos;s automatically run before operations scheduling is started . An operations schedule specifies the following information :
- The product that is planned for production
- The configuration of the product
- The quantities that are involved in the production
- The dates when the production will start and end
- The capacity reservations for the resources that perform the production activities
# # Scheduling direction and date
# # Operations scheduling and master planning
The operations schedule also drives master planning and determines calculations for material requirements . Operations scheduling considers the following information :
- IT admins or developers can easily design mobile workspaces by using the point-and-click workspace designer that is included with the web client .
4 . After you &apos;re on a page , you can perform several actions . Here are some examples :
- Navigate to other pages for related data , such as entity details or lines .
The following illustration shows the process for implementing both mobile workspaces that are provided by Microsoft and custom mobile workspaces .
The following table includes links to resources that can help you implement both mobile workspaces that are provided by Microsoft and custom mobile workspaces . The numbers in the first column correspond to the numbered steps in the previous illustration .

This topic describes , in detail , how to use subcontracted activities in a production flow for lean manufacturing .
# # Production flows that involve subcontractors
The basic principle of a production flow doesn &apos;t change when activities are subcontracted . Material still flows between locations , process activities convert material to products , and transfer activities move material or products from one location to another . You can model locations and work cells as vendor-managed by assigning the vendor account to a warehouse or to a resource of a resource group .
1 . Create a purchase agreement . The purchase agreement is created for the service and connected to the activity of the production flow .
6 . Generate an invoice .
The following sections describe how to configure activities for subcontracting .

title : Warehouse configuration
This article explains how to configure a warehouse . It includes information about how to enable a warehouse layout and warehouse processes .
- You can establish high-priority and low-priority storages areas for optimum placement of goods .
- You can group locations by using physical capacity constraint settings .
- You can control how items are stored and picked , based on query-defined rules .
As part of the process for enabling a warehouse layout , you must define warehouse zone groups , and zones , location profiles , location types , and locations .
# # # Location stocking limits , location profiles , and fixed picking locations
You must consider the physical layout of the warehouse , both to determine storage capacities ( location stocking limits and location profiles ) and as part of your attempts to achieve optimal warehouse processes .
If more advanced calculations are required to control the location capacity constraints , the location profile settings can be used . In this case , the weight and volume are considered when capacity calculations are done .
You can create three types of wave templates :
You must specify the wave process methods in each wave template . The methods that are available vary , depending on the wave template type .
- Cycle count work by location
- Cycle count work by item
When you use work templates to create work , the work pool is automatically assigned to the work .
Work pool IDs can also be used to limit the type of work that is directed to a particular warehouse worker , provided that this functionality is configured on the relevant mobile device menu item .
As the name suggests , location directives are used to direct the work transactions to the appropriate locations in the warehouse . In other words , they define where to pick and put .

title : Reduce balance depreciation
This article gives an overview of the Reducing balance method of depreciation .
When you set up a fixed asset depreciation profile and select Reducing balance in the Method field in the Depreciation profiles page , the assets that have this depreciation profile assigned to them are depreciated by the same percentage in each depreciation period .
Because an asset will never be fully depreciated based on a percentage calculation , you must select the Full depreciation option to fully depreciate an asset .
The Calendar option updates the depreciation base , which is typically the net book value minus the scrap value , on January 1 of each year . In the reducing balance depreciation example later in this topic , the depreciation base is the numerator in the first expression in the calculations column .
- Half-Yearly posts a half-yearly amount at the end of each calendar half-year ( June 30 and December 31 ) .
- Yearly posts the total amount of the depreciation calculated for the fiscal year as one amount on the last day of the fiscal year .
# # Example of reducing balance depreciation
Suppose that the fixed asset acquisition price is 11,000 , the scrap value is 1,000 , and the depreciation percentage factor is 30 .

title : Generate consolidated financial statements
# # Single-level and multilevel consolidations across legal entities
The simplest method for consolidating by using Financial reporting is to use reporting trees to aggregate data across companies that have the same chart of accounts and fiscal periods . Here are the high-level steps to consolidate by using a reporting tree .
1 . Create a row definition , and make sure that all appropriate accounts in all companies are included in the rows .
2 . Create a column definition that includes all the columns that are required for the report that you &apos;re creating .
3 . Create a reporting tree that includes a reporting node for each company that you &apos;re using on consolidated reports .
The following illustration shows how you can use a reporting tree definition in Financial reporting to identify each company that you will consolidate .
As the consolidated report in the following illustration shows , when you use the reporting tree together with a report definition , you can view each company separately . The consolidated amounts are shown at the summary level .
You can also create a multilevel reporting tree that includes as many levels as you require . The following illustration shows a multilevel reporting tree definition that has roll-ups by worldwide region .
The following illustration shows a multilevel reporting tree definition that has roll-ups by function .
# # # Viewing companies side by side
3 . Optional : Add headers and total columns .
The following illustration shows a column definition in a side-by-side format .
# # Consolidations that use organization structures that are created from legal entities
The following illustration shows the consolidated report .
Whether you use accounts , dimensions , or both , Financial reporting lets you filter out the elimination entries by using the dimension filtering capabilities .
# # # Using the reporting tree definition
&gt; You can apply this ownership percentage to any reporting unit , not just at the company level .
# # # Showing ownership as a separate row on the consolidated report
Another option for minority interest is to show 100 percent of the subsidiary for every line on the report but subtract the non-controlling interest from the net income .
2 . Use the reporting unit restriction in the column definition to assign each company to the appropriate column .
# # Different fiscal calendars across multiple legal entities
Different legal entities might have different fiscal calendars but still be required to produce consolidated financial statements . There are two ways to consolidate when different fiscal periods exist across legal entities :
- Create a column definition , and use the period and year to map the appropriate periods for each company .
The following illustration shows the options in the report definition that let you select whether the period number or the period end date is used for the consolidation .
# # Consolidations that involve multiple reporting currencies
# # # Currency translation methods
There are four options for calculating exchange rates in Financial reporting :
( Exchange rate × Days in effect ) ÷ Days in period
Total of exchange rates ÷ Number of exchange rates
# # # Report designer options for currency translation
In Financial reporting , any report can be shown in any number of reporting currencies . The following fields in the report definition support this capability :
# # # Currency translation adjustment
# # # Balance calculation approach
To get correctly translated amounts when currencies are used , Financial reporting uses the following calculation methods for the balances :
title : Reuse product configurations
title : Call center catalogs
# # Use catalogs to drive sales order pricing and promotions
# # Use the source ID to track costs and response rates
# # Configure catalog-specific up-sell and cross-sell items
Up-sell / cross-sell items can also take advantage of the script features to show specific messages that a user will see when the up-sell / cross-sell item is displayed during order entry . Scripts tied to up-sell / cross-sell products configured specifically for a catalog product will only appear when that catalog &apos;s source code is applied in call center order entry .

title : Manage subcontracting work in production
# Manage subcontracting work in production
- Subcontracting of route operations in production orders or batch orders
- The service product must be a stocked product , and it must be part of the BOM .
- This method supports first in , first out ( FIFO ) or standard cost .
- Semi-finished products are represented by the service product in the process .
- Cost control allocates the costs that are associated with subcontracted work to the material costs .
- Subcontracting of production flow activities in a lean production flow
- The service is a non-stocked service product , and it isn &apos;t part of the BOM .
- This method uses purchase agreements as service agreements .
- This method uses backflush costing .
- Cost control allocates subcontracted work in its own cost breakdown block .
A production order can have many operations , and each operation can be allocated to a different vendor . Therefore , an end-to-end production order might trigger multiple purchase orders .
# # Subcontracting of production flow activities
# # # Modeling subcontracting in a production flow
# # Material supply for subcontracted operations
To replenish material at this warehouse , you can use multiple strategies :
- Direct purchase to the vendor location
Semi-finished products are the exception to this rule . To transfer semi-finished products , you &apos;re limited to these options :
Typically , the output warehouse and location of a subcontracted resource group are directly allocated to the warehouse and location of the next step of the operation in the route or production flow . This setup helps reduce the amount of job reporting that occurs or the number additional transfer operations that must be modeled .
The overall product mix of a channel is determined by the published assortments that are assigned to the channel . Therefore , you can configure multiple active assortments per channel .
# # # Basic assortment setup
To make product 2 available at store 1 , you can add the product to assortment 1 .
Alternatively , you can add store 1 to assortment 2 .
Similarly , on the product side , you can include groups of products by using product category hierarchies . You can configure assortments by including one or more category hierarchy nodes . In this case , the assortment will include all products in that category node and its child nodes .
# # # Excluded products or categories
&gt; If a product is both included and excluded in one or more assortments by definition , the product will always be considered excluded .
# # # Global and released products
# # # Dynamic and static assortments
# # # Process assortments batch job
Assortments that are defined in Retail must be processed before they take effect . This processing is done for the following reasons :
Consider the following implementation requirements as you plan and manage assortments for your retail implementation :
title : Info codes and info code groups
# Info codes and info code groups
This article provides an overview about info codes , info code groups , and how to use them .
- Capture additional information at transaction time , such as a flight number or the reason for a return .
- Prompt the register cashier to select from a list of prices for specific products .
- Sell a product as a regular sale , discounted sale , or free product .
- Prompt the cashier to enter a value or select from a list of subcodes when the register drawer is opened without performing a sales operation .
# # Info codes group
- Define fewer info codes and easily re-use them . Info codes that are included in info code groups have no predefined dependencies on other info codes . You can include the same info code in multiple info code groups and then use prioritization to present the same info codes in the order that makes sense in any particular situation .
- Link info codes to other info codes or info code groups to gather information about a product or transaction without having to define a separate info code or linked info code for each scenario .

This topic provides an overview of depreciation for fixed assets .
Depreciation is a periodic transaction that typically reduces the value of the fixed asset on the balance sheet , and is charged as an expenditure to a profit and loss account . Therefore , a main account is typically used to credit the periodic depreciation on the balance sheet . An offset account is an account in the profit and loss part of the chart of accounts .
Extraordinary depreciation works independently of basic depreciation . By having extraordinary depreciation as a separate transaction type , you can post and report the extraordinary depreciation separately from the basic depreciation .
You can create an unlimited number of special depreciation allowance records . After you assign those records to an asset group book , they are applied to the asset book .
A special depreciation allowance is entered as either a percentage or a fixed amount . When you post depreciation proposals , special depreciation allowance transactions are posted to the book as transactions that are separate from the depreciation transactions .
You can create shared calendars by using the * * Fiscal calendars * * page in General ledger .

title : Backflush costing
This topic introduces the concept of backflush costing that is used for Lean manufacturing .
To enable costing , you must complete the following setup :
# # Cost calculation for Lean manufacturing
# # # Calculation that is based on the production flow
# # # Calculation that is based on the route
When material is consumed from inventory to WIP , the cost of material is added to WIP at its actual standard cost for a cost group . This operation occurs under the following conditions :
- Kanban issues are posted for kanban picking lines that update inventory .
- Transfer jobs are completed that update inventory on pick but not receipt ( Transfer of material from inventory to WIP ) .
# # Receiving products from the production flow
Products are received from the production flow under the following conditions :
Products that are received from the production flow are deducted from WIP .
Note that material in WIP isn &apos;t visible in inventory on-hand overviews . However , it &apos;s visible in the kanban quantity overviews .
# # # Automatic empty registration
Scheduled or event kanbans can be set to automatic empty registration in the kanban rule :
3 . Clear the WIP from the realized resource consumption and products .
- Transactions are financially split to map the exact consumed quantities .
- Unused quantities in the production flow WIP remain in physically updated status .
- Financially update the inventory transactions for the completed quantities for the period .
- The applied conversion cost transactions ( route transactions ) that were recorded for the period are financially updated .
- All direct manufacturing cost is financially updated . All kanban process jobs that are completed during the period are accumulated .
- All indirect cost calculated for the consumed material within the period is calculated and deducted from WIP . The remaining indirect cost is posted as a variance .
5 . Calculate the production variances to standard cost . The variance is calculated per cost group .

title : Weighted average with physical value and marking
# Weighted average with physical value and marking
Weighted average is an inventory model based on the weighted average principle , where issues from inventory are valued at the average value of the items that are received into inventory during the inventory closing period , plus any on-hand inventory from the previous period .
If there is only one receipt , all issues can be settled from it and the virtual transfer will not be created .
When using weighted average , you can mark inventory transactions so that a specific item receipt is settled against a specific issue , instead of using the weighted average rule .
We recommend a monthly inventory closing when you use the weighted average inventory model .
The weighted average inventory costing method is calculated by the following formula :
Settlements are inventory close postings that adjust the issues to the correct weighted average as of the closing date . The following examples illustrate the effect of using weighted average with five different configurations :
- Weighted average direct settlement without the Include physical value option
- Weighted average summarized settlement without the Include physical value option
- Weighted average direct settlement with the Include physical value option
- Weighted average summarized settlement with the Include physical value option
- Weighted average with marking
# # Weighted average direct settlement without Include physical value
The direct settlement principle is the same used for weighted average in earlier versions . The system will settle directly between receipts and issues . The system uses this direct settlement principle in certain specific situations :
- Only issues have been posted in the period and the inventory contains on-hand items from a previous closing
In the scenario in the following sections , a financially updated receipt and issue have been posted . During inventory close , the system will settle the receipt directly against the issue , and no adjustment to the cost price is needed on issue . The following transactions are illustrated in the graphic .
The following diagram illustrates this series of transactions with the effects of choosing the Weighted average inventory model and the direct settlement principle without the Include physical value option .
- An inventory transaction value enclosed in brackets indicates that the inventory transaction is physically posted into inventory .
- An inventory transaction value without brackets indicates that the inventory transaction is financially posted into inventory .
- Each new receipt or issue transaction is designated with a new label .
- Inventory closings are represented by a red vertical dashed line and the label Inventory Close .
# # Weighted average summarized settlement without the Include physical value option
The following transactions are illustrated in the graphic below :
- 6a . “ Weighted average inventory close transaction ” financial issue is created to sum the settlements of all the inventory financial receipts .
- 6b . “ Weighted average inventory close transaction ” financial receipt is created as the offset to 5a .
The following diagram illustrates this series of transactions with the effects of choosing the Weighted average inventory model and the summarized settlement principle without the Include physical value option .
- Red arrows illustrate the receipt transactions being settled to the issue transaction created by the system .
- The green arrow represents the offsetting system-generated receipt transaction to which the originally posted issue transaction is settled
# # Weighted average direct settlement with the Include physical value option
The following diagram illustrates this series of transactions with the effects of choosing the Weighted average inventory model and the direct settlement principle with the Include physical value option .
# # Weighted average summarized settlement with the Include physical value option
- 7a . “ Weighted average inventory close transaction ” financial issue is created to sum the settlements of all the inventory financial receipts .
- 7b . “ Weighted average inventory close transaction ” financial receipt is created as the offset to 5a .
# # Weighted average with marking
A receipt transaction is marked to an issue transaction . Then , the valuation method selected for the item ’ s item model group will be disregarded and the system will settle these transactions to each other .
You can mark an issue transaction to a receipt before the transaction is posted . You can do this from a sales order line in the Sales order details page . The open receipt transactions are viewed in the Marking page .
You can mark an issue transaction to a receipt after the transaction has been posted . You can match or mark an issue transaction for an open receipt transaction for an inventoried item from a posted inventory adjustment journal .
- 7 Inventory close is performed . Since the financially updated transaction is marked to an existing receipt these transactions are settled to each other and no adjustment is made .
The following diagram illustrates this series of transactions with the effects of choosing the Weighted average inventory model with marking .
title : Release production orders

Depending on the setup of your organization , you can create purchase requisitions for products that your organization uses . A purchase requisition is an internal document that authorizes the Purchasing department to buy items or services .
After a purchase requisition is approved , it can be used to generate a purchase order . Purchase orders are the external documents that the Purchasing department submits to vendors .
# # # Purchase requisition statuses
# # # Purchase requisition workflow
The following diagram shows the statuses that are assigned to a purchase requisition and a purchase requisition line as they move through the workflow process .
# # # Purchase requisition header and line status relationships
&lt; td &gt; All purchase requisition lines have completed the review process , and there are no more review steps for the purchase requisition .
# # Distributing costs to multiple financial accounts
In the procurement policies , you can control the requisition purposes that are available when a requisition is created for your organization .
# # # Requisitions that have a purpose of consumption
# # # Requisitions that have a purpose of replenishment
# # Purchase requisitions and requests for quotation
By consolidating purchase requisition lines from multiple purchase requisitions , you can increase your negotiating power with your vendors to achieve better pricing , lower shipping and handling costs , and reduced overhead costs .
Purchase requisition lines are eligible for demand consolidation only if the following statements are true :
- The purchase requisition has been approved .
- The purchase requisition meets the purchasing policy rule criteria for manual processing and demand consolidation .
After you add requisition lines to a consolidation opportunity and make any changes that you require , you can create a purchase order for the consolidated purchase requisition lines .
To create a purchase order for purchase requisition lines that aren &apos;t eligible for demand consolidation or aren &apos;t selected for a consolidation opportunity , you must process the lines manually .
# # # Consolidating purchase requisition lines
To consolidate approved purchase requisition lines , follow these steps :
1 . Review approved requisition lines that have been held for manual processing , and that are eligible for demand consolidation .
2 . Select lines to add to a consolidation opportunity .
3 . Create a new consolidation opportunity , or add requisition lines to an existing consolidation opportunity .
4 . Make any required changes to the requisition lines , and remove requisition line items that you no longer want to include in the consolidation opportunity .
5 . Create purchase orders for consolidated requisition lines or for purchase requisition lines in a consolidation opportunity .

title : Project management and accounting
The project management and accounting functionality can be used in multiple industries to provide a service , produce a product , or achieve a result .
The project management and accounting functionality can be used in multiple industries , as shown in the following illustration .
# # # Create project quotations
# # # Create project contracts
# # # Create work breakdown structures
# # # Create project forecasts and budgets
# # # Assign workers , categories , and resources
Here are some of the ways that you can use the resource scheduling functionality :
- Use information about a worker ’ s calendar and availability to match the worker ’ s schedule to the project calendar .
- Review a worker &apos;s availability to make sure that there are no calendar conflicts with the worker &apos;s assignments .
# # # Manage work breakdown structures
# # # Manage project forecasts and budgets
# # # Create production orders
Based on the combinations of these factors , use one of the following methods :
# # # Procure products and services
The purchase and sale of items are prevalent activities in many project-focused businesses .
# # # # Purchase orders for projects
The purpose of the purchase order determines when the purchase order is consumed and , therefore , when items are charged on a project .
&lt; td &gt; Purchase items from an external vendor for consumption on a project . You can create the purchase order in the following ways :
# # # # Sales orders for projects
In Project management and accounting , you can register the consumption of items in several ways . You can sell items or purchase items from a project , or reserve items for a project .
The way that you order items depends on where you &apos;re ordering them from :
&gt; The packing slip for a project-related sales order can ’ t be canceled if the items have already been marked for packing .
The following table lists the methods for ordering items and describes how the items are consumed .
&#124; Method &#124; Purpose &#124; Consumption of item transactions &#124;
# # # Process project invoices
# # # Calculate the cost to complete a project
The following table describes the methods for calculating the cost to complete a project .
At its most basic level , a project is used to group transactions that record costs , and then post these costs to the general ledger .
# # # Analyze cash flow
Use cash flow monitoring to review both the forecasted cash flows and the actual cash flows for a project . You can review cash flows while a project is in progress , or you can view the cash flows of a completed project .
By monitoring cash flows , you can evaluate a single project , use the reports to view multiple projects , and transfer project cash flows to the cash flow forecasts in the general ledger .
# # # # Cash inflow forecasting
The general buffer days can either replace the individual buffer days or be added to the individual buffer days :
- To use the general buffer days as a replacement for the individual buffer days , enter the average number of days between the due date and the actual payment date for customers .
Set up individual buffer days in the project ’ s contract . The days are calculated based on both the sales invoice due date and your organization ’ s experience with a customer &apos;s payment pattern .
# # # # Actual cash inflow
Actual cash inflow resembles forecasting , but you can begin your calculations from the first invoice date . Here is an example :
# # # # Cost forecasting
Based on the days that are defined , the cost payment date can differ from the project date . In this case , the cost payment date is calculated by adding the number of days from the project date to the number of days in the terms of payment .
Based on these settings , here is the cost payment date for each transaction type :
&gt; The due date for the purchase order is based on the vendor transaction when the project purchase order is created . The due date isn &apos;t determined by any default settings .
The cost payment date isn &apos;t calculated on buffer days . After a project is completed , when all costing and invoicing is completed , both the cost and the sales are posted to the profit and loss accounts .
# # # # Viewing the remaining budgeted amounts
# # # # Viewing the total budgeted amounts
The utilization rate is the percentage of time that a worker performs billable or productive work in a specific working period . Billable hours are the worker ’ s hours that can be charged to a specific customer .
When you calculate the utilization rate for a worker , you can calculate either the billable rate or the efficiency rate :
# # # Review project statements
- Project date / ledger date

- Product subtype : Distinct products or product masters
- Definition of the product variant model :
- Association of the product with one or more categories
- Definition of the product and category attributes
- Units of measure and related conversions
- Translations for all names and descriptions
Note that , in dynamic and agile organizations , product information data changes every day . Therefore , maintenance of accurate and actual product data is a critical business process on its own .

title : Free text invoices in the public sector
# Free text invoices in the public sector
This topic describes the free text invoice functionality that is available for public sector as well as answers common questions about using billing classifications and billing codes with free text invoices .
Do I have to select a billing classification for every free text invoice ?
# # Why should I use billing codes when I create free text invoices ?
When you select a billing code , default values are automatically entered in many fields on the invoice line . This makes data entry faster and more accurate . Billing codes are also used with posting definitions to control how Accounts receivable transactions are posted to the ledger .
Settings on the billing code control whether you can change certain fields .
- If the billing code on a free text invoice line doesn ’ t allow rate changes on the invoice , you can ’ t change the amount , the unit price , or the amount details on the line .
&gt; To change the ledger account for invoice lines related to projects , changes have to be allowed both on the billing code itself and on the Projects section of the Accounts receivable parameters page .
# # Where does the interest code on a free text invoice come from ?
The interest code can be set on the billing code , the billing classification , or the posting profile .

title : Build a product configuration model
# Build a product configuration model
The need to configure products to meet special requirements is becoming the rule rather than the exception , in both business-to-business and business-to-consumer relationships .
The key to success here is to carefully analyze the product portfolio , and to look for patterns in both product features and processes . The goal is to identify generic components that can be manufactured by the same equipment and used in all variants .
# # Building a product configuration model
A product configuration model consists of one or more components that are tied together through subcomponent relationships . Components are defined one time , and can then be used many times in one or more product configuration models . The components are the main building blocks of a product configuration model , and nearly all information about the model is related to them .
Table constraints can be user-defined or system-defined .
A user-defined table constraint is built by the user . The user selects a combination of attribute types to represent the columns of the table and then enters values from the domains of the selected attribute types to form the rows in the table constraint .
A table constraint is included in a product configuration model by referencing the table constraint definition and mapping the relevant attributes in the model to the columns in the table constraint .
Subcomponents represent the nodes in the product configuration model structure . For each subcomponent relationship , a reference must be specified to a product master that has the variant configuration technology set to constraint-based configuration .
BOM lines are included to identify the manufacturing BOM for each component . A BOM line must reference an item , and all item properties can be set to a fixed value or mapped to an attribute .
Route operations are included to identify the manufacturing route . A route operation must reference a defined operation , and all operation properties can be set to a fixed value . All properties except resource requirements can be mapped to an attribute instead of a value .
# # Validating and testing a product configuration model
Similarly , a condition for a BOM line or a route operation can be validated in isolation .
Finally , validation can be done for a complete product configuration model to verify that the complete syntax is correct , and that all naming and modeling conventions have been respected .
# # # The configuration page
To navigate between components , click * * Next * * , or click a component in the product configuration model tree to set focus on it .
# # Finalizing a model for configuration
When a product configuration model is ready to be used in configure-to-order scenarios , a version must be created . However , there are several options that can enhance the modeling experience .
The configuration UI can be modified by introducing attribute groups in one or more subcomponents . Such a grouping can highlight the relationships between specific attributes and help the configuration user identify the area of the product that is currently in focus .
One or more configuration templates can be created to speed up the configuration process . Alternatively , templates can be created to promote specific attribute combinations , such as when a sales campaign focuses on a specific set of product features .
# # Extending a product configuration model through the API
The following flow diagram outlines the process .

title : Vendor invoices overview
A vendor invoice from a purchase order is an invoice that is produced when products or services are received according to a purchase order that was placed with a vendor . The vendor invoice contains a header , and one or more lines for items or services . A vendor invoice completes the cycle from purchase order to product receipt to vendor invoice .
There are several ways to enter a vendor invoice :
- The vendor invoice register lets you quickly enter invoices that don &apos;t reference a purchase order , so that you can accrue the expense . By using the vendor invoice approval journal , you can select those invoices and post them to the vendor balance to reverse the accrual .
- The vendor invoice journal lets you quickly enter invoices that don &apos;t reference a purchase order , in a single step .
- Together with the vendor invoice pool , the vendor invoice register lets you quickly enter invoices to accrue the expense . You can open the associated purchase orders later to post the invoice against the expense account .
# # Adding a line that wasn &apos;t on the purchase order

title : Total cost allocation method
This topic provides guidelines for using total cost allocation ( TCA ) . TCA is a method of calculating the cost between the main formula item for a batch order and the co-products that are defined for the formula .
# # Using TCA for coproducts
Here are some of the guidelines for using TCA for co-products :
- You don ’ t need to manually enter cost allocation percentages for co-products . Instead , the system automatically creates the cost allocation percentage as the average of active cost prices of co-products .
- You don ’ t need to enter standard cost for non-standard cost items that are co-products . There are two types of costing versions in the system : standard cost and planned cost
- You added co-products .
- You used a different method of cost allocation for the co-products .
- The percentage of cost allocation is more than 0 ( zero ) .

Leave and absence plans can be suspended to make them inactive and prevent additional accruals . Accruals are suspended for employees if their employment ends .
An employee can be enrolled in a higher plan tier by using a worker-specific date to override the employee &apos;s default plan offering . Employees can receive a manual adjustment to their leave and absence balance at the time of plan enrollment , or HR can make a manual adjustment at any time .
A workflow can be customized and applied to time-off requests to meet the organization ’ s requirements .
title : One voucher
# # What is One voucher ?
- Enter a multiline voucher where there is no offset account .
# # Issues with One voucher
For example , you post the following multiline voucher .
# # The future of One voucher
# # Why use One voucher ?
# # # Scenarios that require One voucher
# # # Post vendor or customer payments in summary form to a bank account
# # # Mechanism to group transactions from a business event
If an organization must view the accounting entries from a business event together , it must use One voucher .
If the Reimbursement periodic task is run from the Accounts receivable module , it creates a transaction to move the balance from a customer to a vendor . For this scenario , One voucher must be used to reimburse the customer .
The following fixed asset transactions also create multiple transactions in a single voucher :
- An asset is split .
- A parameter to calculate depreciation on disposal is turned on , and then the asset is disposed of .
- An asset &apos;s service date is before the acquisition date . Therefore , a depreciation adjustment is posted .
# # # Bills of exchange and promissory notes
Bills of exchange and promissory notes require that One voucher be used , because the transactions move the customer or vendor balance from one Accounts receivable / Accounts payable ledger account to another , based on the state of the payment .
# # Scenarios that don &apos;t require One voucher
# # # Post customer payments in summary form to the bank account
An organization deposits customer payments , or the bank deposits customer payments on the organization &apos;s behalf , and the deposit is shown as a lump sum on the bank account .
Summarization of customer payments is supported through the deposit functionality when &quot; bridging &quot; isn &apos;t used on the method of payment .
Netting can be accomplished by entering the increase and decrease in separate vouchers , and then posting the offset to a clearing ledger account .
# # # Post in summary to the general ledger
# # # Settle multiple unposted payments to the same invoice
# # # Import bank statement transactions
Transactions can be grouped by using other fields on the journal , such as the journal batch number itself or the document number .
# # # Enter beginning balances
# # # Correct the accounting entry of a posted customer or vendor document
An organization might have to correct the Accounts receivable or Accounts payable ledger account for an accounting entry of a posted invoice , but that invoice can &apos;t be reversed or corrected through another mechanism .
Organizations often use the One voucher functionality merely because the system lets them use it , without understanding the implications .

title : Dimension-based product configuration
Dimension-based product configuration represents a simple solution for creating many product variants from a single product master and its bill of materials .
Dimension-based product configuration is one of the three built-in product configuration technologies . The two other technologies are predefined variants and constraint-based configuration . All three technologies use a product master as the starting point and allow the user to create many product variants for one product master .
Dimension-based product configuration is based on the following key concepts :
- Configuration product dimension
A product master is the starting point for any product configuration process . For the dimension-based product configuration , you need a product master with this particular configuration technology and a product dimension group that includes the configuration product dimension .
# # # Configuration product dimension
Configuration groups are defined in a central repository and can be used for all dimension-based product configuration models . Configuration groups are associated to the individual BOM lines and hold together a group of lines that are mutually exclusive . This means that only one line in a group can be selected for a single product variant .
# # # Bill of materials ( BOM )
The configuration route determines the sequence of the configuration groups , as they will be displayed to the user during the product configuration process .
The configuration rules represent a mechanism for ensuring that a product included in one configuration group in a BOM enforces either an inclusion or an exclusion of a product in a different configuration group in the same BOM .
The following eight task guides are listed in the order in which you should complete them .
title : Design questionnaires
- Clearly define the purpose of the questionnaire to help guarantee that the questions support the purpose .
- Determine the individual person or the group of people who should complete the questionnaire .
- Write questions that will appear on the questionnaire , and include answer choices , if applicable .
- Be sure that the questionnaire flows logically , so that respondents remain engaged .
- Arrange questions and answers in the order that they should be presented to respondents in .
- Decide how the results should be evaluated , if applicable .
The design phase includes four categories of tasks that you must complete in this order :
1 . Set up prerequisites , as required .
2 . Set up answer groups and answers , if applicable .
3 . Set up questions and their association with the answer groups .
4 . Set up the questionnaire itself , and attach questions to it .
&#124; Questionnaire parameters &#124; Modify basic controls and default settings for questionnaires . &#124;
- Review process
Questionnaire parameters are optional . You might not use them , depending on your company ’ s requirements .
Questionnaire parameters define the anonymity , number sequence codes , and reference types of a questionnaire . When an organization distributes a questionnaire , the option to allow respondents to remain anonymous might be of concern .
The number sequence codes are used to organize questions and answers . Based on these number sequence codes , values are automatically assigned to items .
You should define all parameters before you begin to create your data . You can modify the questionnaire parameter settings at any time .
# # # Answer groups and answers
Respondents can answer a question in two ways , depending on the subject of the question :
- Closed-ended questions require that the respondent select an answer in a list of possible correct answers .
To provide a list of possible answers for closed-ended questions , you can create answers on the * * Answer groups * * page .
An answer group can be used for more than one question on the same questionnaire , and can also be used on more than one questionnaire .
A questionnaire must contain questions . Questions can be either open-ended or closed-ended .
- The responses to open-ended questions aren &apos;t controlled , and respondents can type their answers .
Questions can be arranged in a conditional question hierarchy , so that secondary questions depend on the answer that the respondent selects for the previous question . You can write the questions first and then arrange them into a hierarchy later .
For each questionnaire , you can specify the following information :
- The total time or time limit to answer mandatory questions .
- Whether all questions are mandatory .
- Whether to calculate points on a questionnaire .
- How to categorize results .
- Whether the questionnaire will be available to a restricted set of respondents .
- Whether a form template should be displayed as a background behind each page of the questionnaire .
- Whether to display questions in a fixed order or randomly select them from a pool .
- Whether questions will be asked only if specific responses are given for previous answers .
# # # Set up a questionnaire
1 . Create a questionnaire .
2 . Follow one of these steps to attach questions to the questionnaire :
- If you &apos;re using result groups , you can attach questions to a questionnaire by using result groups . First set up the result groups for the questionnaire , and then add questions to the result groups .
- If you aren &apos;t using result groups , you can attach questions directly to the questionnaire .
3 . Set up a conditional question hierarchy , if it &apos;s required .
# # # Modify a questionnaire
You can complete the following tasks on the * * Questionnaires * * page :
- Modify information in the questionnaire , such as the result groups and questions .
- Delete and add questions .
- Make changes in the result groups and sequence number .
In a questionnaire , you can &apos;t delete the following types of questions :
- Questions that are attached to a questionnaire
Result groups are optional when you attach questions to a questionnaire .
A result group is used to calculate points and categorize the results of a questionnaire . If you use result groups , you can perform the following tasks :
- Evaluate questionnaire results , based on point statistics .
- Evaluate a respondent ’ s score for each result group that you set up .
- Define points for answers in the answer groups that are assigned to each question .
- Set up a questionnaire .
To attach questions to a questionnaire by using result groups , first set up the result groups for the questionnaire , and then add questions to the result groups . If you don &apos;t use result groups , you can attach questions directly to a questionnaire .
Because a result group is related to the points that are associated with specific sets of questions on a questionnaire , you can use only a specific result group for a questionnaire .
You &apos;re using a questionnaire for a leadership test that has 15 questions in three categories . You create three result groups and add five questions to each result group . Points are then totaled in the three groups . The three result groups are as follows :
- Technical abilities
The following table shows the point-based messages that you define for the “ leadership abilities ” result group .
&#124; 1 to 3 &#124; You have average leadership abilities . &#124;
&#124; 4 to 7 &#124; You have good leadership abilities . &#124;
&#124; 8 to 10 &#124; You have outstanding leadership abilities . &#124;
You can set up point intervals and texts for each result group on a questionnaire . Texts that correspond to each respondent ’ s score are displayed for each result group .
Conditional question hierarchies are optional when you set up a questionnaire .

title : SEPA direct debit overview
# # What is the Core Direct Debit scheme ?
The SEPA Core Direct Debit Scheme is the basic scheme . It has the following attributes :
- The transfer of funds is in euros ( even though the bank accounts may hold funds in other currencies ) .
- The customer and creditor must each hold an account with a credit institution that is located within the SEPA .
- The customer must grant a signed mandate to the creditor .
- Mandates expire 36 months after the last initiated collection .
- The creditor must store mandates for as long as the mandate is valid and for at least 14 months after the last collection .
- The scheme may be used for single ( one-time ) or recurring direct debit collections .
- Customers have a “ no questions asked ” right to receive a refund for up to eight weeks after the debit of their account .
The SEPA B2B Direct Debit Scheme applies to business-to-business transactions and builds on the SEPA Core Direct Debit Scheme . The main differences are :
- The SEPA B2B Direct Debit Scheme is not allowed when the customer is a private individual ( consumer ) .
- The customer is not entitled to obtain a refund of an authorized transaction .
- The scheme offers a shorter timeline for presenting direct debits and reduces the return period .
# # Can I use the COR1 scheme for direct debit mandates ?
# # Where do I enter creditor identifiers ( Direct debit IDs ) ?
# # What are mandates ?
# # In what file formats can I generate SEPA direct debit payment files ?

title : Plan your organizational hierarchy
# # Decide whether to model internal organizations as legal entities or operating units
Some functionality in Finance and Operations works differently depending on whether the organization is a legal entity or an operating unit . Carefully consider the functionality described below as you make your decision .
# # # # If the organization is modeled as an operating unit
Master data is shared among operating units .
Module parameters are shared among operating units .
Operating units must share a fiscal calendar . If your internal organizations can use the same fiscal years and fiscal calendars , you can model the organizations as operating units .
You must consolidate the financial results for regional offices into a single , consolidated company in order to prepare financial statements .
Consolidation is not required , because data is already shared among operating units .
Centralized payments must be set up so that invoices for all child legal entities can be paid to or from a single parent legal entity .
Centralized payments are not required because all invoices are recorded in a single legal entity .
If you model the regional office as a legal entity , you have the following options :
- Headquarters creates a journal entry to cross-charge the regional office for the expense . The transactions cannot be aged .
- Headquarters sends a purchase order for the services to the regional office . A sales order is automatically created in the legal entity for the regional office , with intercompany sub-ledger transactions .
- The invoice and payment follow the regulatory requirements of headquarters . Headquarters can create an intercompany sub-ledger transaction .
If you model the regional office as an operating unit , headquarters enters an expense transaction and codes it to the regional office .
# # # Local tax requirements
If your organizations must use different functional currencies , you must model the organizations as legal entities . Functional currencies are set up per legal entity . However , you can enter transactions in multiple currencies .
If your organizations can use a single functional currency , you can model the organizations as operating units . Operating units must share a functional currency . However , you can enter transactions and create reports in multiple currencies .
Number sequences for some references can be set up per legal entity . Some number sequences can be shared .
Number sequences for some references can be set up per operating unit . Some number sequences can be shared .
All operating units share the same set of products . If your internal organizations can share the same set of products , you can model the organizations as operating units .
# # # Inquiry and reporting
You must manually change companies to enter transactions and perform inquiries in multiple legal entities . Because of data security boundaries , consolidated inquiry and reporting can be resource intensive and time-consuming .
You do not need to change companies to access data from multiple operating units . Consolidated inquiry and reporting and individual regional inquiry is easier and faster .
- Model multiple hierarchies for operating units if you have complex requirements for reporting profit and loss .
- In a single legal entity , do not model multiple hierarchies for the same hierarchy purpose .
- Do not create a hierarchy for every purpose . Usually , you can use one hierarchy for multiple purposes . For example , one hierarchy of operating units can be assigned to all policy-related purposes .
- Do not model a separate hierarchy of operating units if the structure for legal entities is also your operating structure . A mixed hierarchy of legal entities and operating units may serve both purposes .
- Before you model major restructuring scenarios , use the hierarchy &apos;s effective dates to perform an impact analysis and a validation test .
- Use draft mode to change a hierarchy before you publish a new version in a production environment .
- Limit the number of people who have permissions to add or remove organizations from a hierarchy in a production environment . A smaller number reduces the chance that costly mistakes can occur and corrections must be made .

Expenses that are related to workers often make up a large proportion of an organization &apos;s costs . Position forecasting lets you plan those expenses and include them in the planning of budgets .
# # Position forecasting in budget planning
Position forecasting uses three main components to provide accurate budget amounts for position expenses . These amounts can then be brought into a budget plan for budget calculations .
# # # Position forecasting processes
You can create additional forecast position versions as budget plans are revised . These new versions provide a basis for the revisions .
# # # Budget cost elements
If the cost element is based on a percentage , you must specify the budget cost elements that are used as the basis for the calculation .
Finally , Jodi adds all the earning cost elements that are used for base pay as calculation bases . Her budget cost element is now ready to be used .
Compensation groups can be used to group forecast position that have similar compensation attributes . They can also be used to define a forecast position ’ s earnings and annual increases , and to assign a set of common budget cost elements .
# # # Creating forecast positions for existing positions
# # # Creating new forecast positions
You can create new forecast positions in two ways : by copying an existing forecast position and by creating a completely new forecast position .
# # Working with forecast positions
# # # Multiple versions of a forecast position
# # # Modifying forecast positions
# # # # Budget cost elements
# # # # Generating increases
# # # # Changes from other pages
Updates to forecast positions can also come from other areas , such as the budget cost element and the compensation group setup pages . You can also modify forecast positions by using the mass update process .
The recalculation process is automatically used on any forecast position that has changed .
# # Bringing forecast positions into budget plans
# # # Generating a budget plan from forecast positions
As for other generation processes , three options are available :
# # # Selecting forecast positions
# # # # Date options
# # # # Changing budget plan lines that have forecast positions

title : &quot; About Searching and Filtering in Business Central &quot;
This article answers common questions you might have about searching and filtering .
# # Is there a difference between searching and filtering ?
- Search is simple and broad : it matches records that contain the search text across any visible fields on the page , and is case insensitive .
# # Is there a keyboard experience for search and filter ?
# # Is the filter pane available on all lists ?
# # How can I save my filters ?
Unlike filters , search text is not remembered when you navigate away from a page .
# # Can I search and filter using the companion apps and Outlook AddIn ?
On different form factors such as mobile devices or in Outlook , you can search in lists but cannot filter on individual fields in most cases .
# # Will Microsoft extend the filter pane experience ?

# # # Recurring Frequency field
If you want to post an entry on the last day of every month , you can do one of the following :
# # # Expiration Date field
This field determines the date on which the line will be posted for the last time . The line will not be posted after this date .
The advantage of using the field is that the line will not be deleted from the journal immediately and you can always replace the present expiration date with a later one so that you can use the line further into the future .
If the field is blank , the line will be posted every time you post until it is deleted from the journal .
# # # Allocating Recurring Journal Amounts to Several Accounts
Just as in a recurring journal , you need to enter an allocation only once . The allocation will remain in the allocation journal after posting , so you do not need to enter amounts and allocations every time you post the recurring journal line .
# # # # Example : Allocating Rent Payments to Different Departments
When you have finished saving the standard item journal , the Item Journal page is displayed so you can proceed to post it , knowing that it can easily be recreated next time you need to post the same or similar lines .
The Standard Item Journals page opens showing codes and descriptions for all existing standard item journals .

# Set Up Work Centers and Machine Centers
The program distinguishes between three types of capacities . These are arranged hierarchically . Each level contains the subordinate levels .
The top level is the work center group . Work centers are assigned to the work center groups . Every work center can only belong to one work center group .
You can assign various machine centers to every work center . A machine center may only belong to one work center .
The planned capacity of a work center consists of the availability of the corresponding machine centers and the additional planned availability of the work center . The planned availability of the work center group is , therefore , the sum of all corresponding availabilities of the machine centers and work centers .
# # To set up a work center
# # Example - Different Machine Centers Assigned to a Work Center
If capacities of work centers are to make no contribution to the total capacity , you can achieve this with efficiency = 0 .
# # To set up a capacity constrained machine or work center
&gt; In case of operation splitting , the setup time is only assigned once because it is assumed that some manual adjustment is done to optimize the schedule .

title : How to Pick Items with Inventory Picks &#124; Microsoft Docs
You can create an inventory pick in three ways :
- Create the inventory pick directly from the source document itself .
- You can create inventory picks for several source documents at the same time by using the batch job .
# # To request an inventory pick by releasing the source document
For sales orders , purchase return orders , and outbound transfer orders , you create the warehouse request by releasing the order . The following describes how to do this from a sales order .
After the warehouse request has been created , a warehouse employee assigned to picking items can see that the source document is ready to be picked and can create a new pick document based on the warehouse request .
# # To create an inventory pick based on the source document
Now that the request is created , the warehouse employee can create a new inventory pick based on the released source document .
# # To create an inventory pick from the source document
# # To create multiple inventory picks with a batch job
&gt; If picking and shipping sales line quantities that are assembled to the order you should follow certain rules when creating the inventory pick lines . For more information , see the “ Handling Assemble-to-Order Items in Inventory Picks ” section .
# # To record the inventory picks
The posting process will post the shipment of the source document lines that have been picked , or in the case of production orders , the posting process will post the consumption . If the location uses bins , the posting will also create warehouse entries to post the bin quantity changes .

If the data request creates a URL that is too long , it will fail . Common causes may include :
- Generally , any source table with over 250 rows
- Source tables containing multiple thousands of records
Follow these steps as a workaround .
1 . Choose to edit the flow that is failing .
For example , if the table that you are using as a data source has 4,000 records , enter 4,000 as the number of records to skip .

# Design Details : Handling Reordering Policies
For an item to participate in supply planning , a reorder policy must be defined . The following four reordering policies exist :
* Fixed Reorder Qty .
* Maximum Qty .
You can transfer inventory items between locations by creating transfer orders . Alternatively , you can use the item reclassification journal .
With transfer orders , you ship the outbound transfer from one location and receive the inbound transfer at the other location . This allows you to manage the involved warehouse activities and provides more certainty that inventory quantities are updated correctly .
# # To transfer items with a transfer order
As a warehouse worker at the transfer-from location , proceed to ship the items .
The items are now in transit between the specified locations , according to the specifies transfer route .
As a warehouse worker at the transfer-from location , proceed to receive the items .

# Design Details : Posting Date on Adjustment Value Entry
1 . Initially the Posting Date of the entry to be created is the same date as the entry it adjusts .
2 . The Posting Date is validated against Inventory Periods and / or General Ledger Setup .
Below , the first Value Entry ( 379 ) represents the shipment and carry the same Posting Date as the parent Item ledger Entry .
The second Value Entry ( 381 ) represents the invoice .
Step 2 : Validation of initial assigned Posting Date .
Let ’ s review the above mentioned Sale by adding setup of allowed posting date ranges .
First allowed posting date is the first day in the first open period . September 1st , 2013 .
General Ledger Setup :
First allowed posting date is the date stated in field Allow Posting From : September 10th , 2013 .
Step 3 : Assignment of an allowed posting date ;
We have now reviewed the concept for assigning Posting Dates to Value Entries created by the Adjust Cost - Item entries batch job .
Let ’ s continue to review some scenarios that we in the support team comes across from time to time in relation to assigned Posting Dates in the Adjust Cost – Item entries batch job and related setups .
# # # Scenario I : “ Posting Date is not within your range of allowed posting dates … ”
This is a scenario where a user is experiencing mentioned error message when the Adjust Cost – Item entries batch job is run .
In the previous section , describing the concept of assigning posting dates , the intention of the Adjust Cost – Item entries batch job is to create a Value Entry with Posting Date September 10th .
We follow up on the User Setup :
The user in this case has an allowed posting date range from September 11th to September 30th and is thereby not allowed to post the Adjustment Value Entry with Posting Date September 10th .
# # # Revaluation scenario :
Inventory setup :
- Automatic Cost Posting = Yes
- Automatic Cost Adjustment = Always
- Average Cost Calc . Type = item
- Average Cost Period = Day
- Allow Posting From = January 1st , 2014
- Allow Posting To = empty
- Allow Posting From = December 1st , 2013 .
# # # # # To test the scenario
Base unit of measure = PCS
Select optional posting groups .
2 . Open Item Journal , create and post a line as follows :
Posting Date = December 15th , 2013
Entry Type = Purchase
3 . Open Item Journal , create and post a line as follows :
Entry Type = Negative Adjustment
4 . Open Item Journal , create and post a line as follows :
Date = January 15th , 2014
5 . Open Revaluation Journal , create and post a line as follows :
Applies-to Entry = select Purchase entry posted at step 2 . The Posting Date of the revaluation will be the same as the entry it adjusts .
Unit Cost Revalued = 40
The following Item Ledger and Value Entries have been posted :
The Adjust Cost – Item entries batch job has recognized a change in cost and adjusted the Negative Adjustments .
To achieve adjustment in December of the Negative Adjustment in step 3 , the General Ledger Setup , Allow Posting From field , need to state a date in December .
User groups not allowed to post in December but in January , which was probably intended to be limited by the General Ledger Setup in this scenario , should instead be addressed via the User setup .
# # # Item charge scenario :
2 . Create new purchase order
On the purchase order line :
Item = CHARGE
Post Receive and Invoice .
3 . Create new sales order :
Posting Date = December 16th , 2013
On the sales order line :
Post Ship and Invoice .
4 . General Ledger Setup :
Allow Posting From = January 1st , 2014
Allow Posting To = blank
5 . Create new purchase order :
Posting Date = January 2nd , 2014
Item Charge = JB-FREIGHT
Direct Unit Cost = 3
Assign Item Charge to Purchase Receipt from step 2 .
Create new purchase order :
Posting Date = December 30th , 2013
Direct Unit Cost = 2
Assign Item Charge to Purchase Receipt from step 2
Inventory Valuation report is printed as of Date December 31st , 2013
# # History of Adjust Cost – Item entries batch job
In the request form of the Adjust Cost - Item Entries batch job there is a Posting Date to be entered by the user . The batch job runs through all necessary changes and creates value entries with the posting date entered in the request form . Suggested posting date to use is today ’ s date .
# # History of Post Inventory cost to G / L batch job
The Post Inventory Cost to G / L batch job is closely related to the Adjust Cost – Item entries batch job why the history of this batch job is summarized and shared here as well .
In the request form of the Post Inventory Cost to G / L there is a Posting Date to be entered by the user . The batch job runs through all value entries within the filter , if any , and creates General Ledger Entries with Posting Date entered in the request form .
The batch job scans Table 5811 - Post Value Entry to G / L , to identify the Value Entries in scope for posting to General Ledger . After successful run the table is emptied .
Any feedback to how this process and documentation can be further developed is very welcome .

# # To customize a calendar
The main task in customizing a base calendar for your company , or one of its business partners , is to enter any changes to working and nonworking day status .
For example , while a base calendar would typically list all Saturdays as non-working days , the customized calendar for a particular location may list all Saturdays during the months of November and December , and leading up to the holiday season , as working days .
# # To assign a base calendar
The following procedure schedules delivery dates on sales order lines for a customer as an example .
Base calendars are assigned to your own company , customers , vendors , locations , and shipping agents as follows :
&gt; - If you do not assign a base calendar to a company , all dates are calculated as working days .
&gt; - If you enter a blank location on an order line , all dates are calculated as working days .
&gt; - Any base calendar defined for the vendor or the location affects how the dates are calculated and rounded to working days .
&gt; Before you can make customized calendar entries , you must first assign a base calendar to the company .

# Design Details : Central Concepts of the Planning System
MRP and MPS , Calculate Net Change Plan , and Calculate Regenerative Plan are all functions within one code unit that contains the planning logic . However , the supply plan calculation involves different sub systems .
# # Planning Starting Date
To avoid a supply plan that incorporates open orders in the past and suggests potentially impossible actions , the planning system treats all dates before the planning starting date as a frozen zone where the following special rule applies :
In other words , it assumes that the plan for the past is executed according to the given plan .
# # Dynamic Order Tracking ( Pegging )
In companies with a low item flow and less advanced product structures , it may be adequate to use the Dynamic Order Tracking as the main means of supply planning . However , in busier environments , the planning system should be used to ensure a properly balanced supply plan at all times .
# # # Dynamic Order Tracking versus the Planning System
After the planning run , no action messages remain in the Action Message Entry table , because they have been replaced by the suggested actions in the planning worksheet
# # Sequence and Priority in Planning
When establishing a plan , the sequence of the calculations is important to get the job done within a reasonable timeframe . In addition , the prioritization of requirements and resources play an important role in obtaining the best results .
# # # Item Priority / Low-Level Code
# # Demand Forecasts and Blanket Orders
The planning system monitors such events and assigns the appropriate items for planning .
- Calculate Regenerative Plan – Calculates all selected items , whether it is necessary or not .
- Calculate Net Change Plan – Calculates only those selected items that have had some change in their demand-supply pattern and , therefore , have been assigned for planning .
In addition to these considerations , the planning system only plans for those items that the user has prepared with appropriate planning parameters . Otherwise , it is assumed that the user will plan the items manually or semi-automatically by using the Order Planning feature .
Demand and supply can carry variant codes and location codes that must be respected when the planning system balances demand and supply .
Instead of calculating any theoretical combination of variant and location , the program calculates only those combinations that actually exist in the database .
An order-to-order link between demand and supply is another type of attribute that affects the planning system .
Certain attributes on demand are specific and must be matched exactly by a corresponding supply . The following two specific attributes exist :
For these attributes , the planning system applies the following rules :
- Demand with specific attributes can only be fulfilled by supply with matching attributes .
- Supply with specific attributes can also satisfy demand that does not ask specifically for those attributes .
Accordingly , if a demand for specific attributes cannot be met by inventory or projected supplies , the planning system will suggest a new supply order to cover this specific demand with no regard of planning parameters .
Another special case that uses order-to-order links is when an assembly order is linked to a sales order in an assemble-to-order scenario .
Order-to-order links are applied between demand and supply in four ways :
- When the planned item uses the reordering policy Order .
- When using the manufacturing policy Make-to-Order to create multi-level or project-type production orders ( producing needed components on the same production order ) .
- When creating production orders for sales orders with the Sales Order Planning feature .
- When assembling an item to a sales order . ( Assembly Policy is set to Assemble-to-Order .
Reservations and order tracking links will break if a situation becomes impossible , such as moving the demand to a date earlier than the supply . However , the order-to-order link adapts to any changes in the respective demand or supply and thereby the link is never broken .
The planning system does not include any reserved quantities in the calculation . For example , if a sales order has been totally or partially reserved against the quantity in inventory , the reserved quantity in inventory cannot be used to cover other demand . The planning system does not include this demand-supply set in its calculation .
The following illustration shows how reservations can hinder the most feasible plan .
- When back-dated supply or demand events exist .
The exception warning is displayed if the projected available inventory drops below the safety stock quantity . The planning system will suggest a supply order to meet the demand on its due date . The warning text states the item ’ s safety stock quantity and the date on which it is violated .
The attention warning is displayed in three situations :
- The planning line suggests changing a released purchase or production order .
Dampener time can be added to resources to minimize operation splitting . This enables the system to schedule load on the last possible day by exceeding the critical load percent slightly if this can reduce the number of operations that are split .

title : Create a Sales Order and Sell Products &#124; Microsoft Docs
You create a sales order or sales invoice to record your agreement with a customer to sell certain products on certain delivery and payment terms .
After the customer has confirmed the agreement , for example after a quote process , you can send an order confirmation to record your obligation to deliver the products as agreed .
You can fill customer fields on the sales order in two ways depending on whether the customer is already registered . See steps 2 and 3 in the following procedure .
# # To create a sales order
Several fields on the sales order are now filled with information that you specified on the new customer card .
The price and line amounts are shown with or without sales tax depending on what you selected in the * * Prices Including Tax * * field on the customer card .
The totals under the lines are automatically calculated as you create or modify lines .
You are now ready to fill in the sales order lines for products that you are selling to the customer or for any transaction with the customer that you want to record in a G / L account .
You leave the * * No . * * field empty in the following cases :
The related item and customer ledger entries are now created in your system , and the sales order is output as a PDF document . When the sales order is fully posted , it is removed from the list of sales orders and replaced with new documents in the list of posted sales invoices and the list of posted sales shipments .

Managing receivables includes checking whether amounts due are paid on time . If customers have overdue payments , you can begin by sending the Customer Statement report as a reminder . Alternatively , you can issue reminders .
After you have created reminders and made any needed modifications , you can either print test reports or issue the reminders , typically as email .
When a customer does not pay by the due date , you can have finance charges calculated automatically and add them to the overdue amounts on the customer &apos;s account . You can inform customers of the added charges by sending finance charge memos .
&gt; You use finance charge memos to calculate interest and finance charges and to inform your customers about interest and finance charges without reminding them of overdue payments . Alternatively , you can calculate interest on overdue payments when you create reminders .
After you have created finance charge memos and made any needed modifications , you can either print test reports or issue the finance charge memos , typically as email .

# Create Custom Company Configuration Packages
As you grow your business , you will likely come to rely on a set of company types that you use with most of your customers . You can streamline your implementation process by turning these types into company configuration packages that are available for reuse .
Another approach would be to create a package that includes the tables that define setup , such as the following :
- Inventory Posting Setup
# # To create a custom company configuration package
3 . Setup the new company in the way you need . Fill in all required setup tables .
4 . Open the new company .

# Design Details : Reservation , Order Tracking , and Action Messaging
The reservations system is comprehensive and includes the interrelated and parallel features of Order Tracking and Action Messaging .
The reservation system interacts with the planning system by creating action messages on planning lines during planning runs . An action message can be considered an appendage to an order tracking record . Action messages , whether created dynamically in order tracking or during the planning run , provide a convenient tool for efficient supply planning .
# # # Offsetting in Reservations
Reservations are made against available item quantities . Item availability is calculated in basic terms as follows :
available quantity = inventory + scheduled receipts - gross requirements
The following table shows the details of the order network entities that are part of the availability calculation .
The following table shows when and which modifications may occur :
&#124; User Action &#124; System Reaction &#124;
&#124; Decreasing the reserved quantity &#124; The related quantity fields are updated . &#124;
&#124; Deleting the order &#124; The reservation is canceled . &#124;
Automatic reservations that are created during the planning run are handled in the following ways :
- They are included and potentially changed in subsequent planning runs , as opposed to manually reserved items .
Order Tracking helps the planner maintain a valid supply plan by providing an overview of the offsetting between demand and supply in the order network . The order tracking records serve as the foundation for creating dynamic action messages and planning line suggestions during planning runs .
&gt; The order tracking system offsets available stock as orders are entered into the order network . This implies that the system does not prioritize orders that may be more urgent in terms of their due date . It is therefore up to the logic of the planning system or the wisdom of the planner to rearrange these priorities in a meaningful way .
# # # The Order Network
# # # Offsetting in Order Tracking
In contrast to reservations , which can only be made against available item quantities , order tracking is possible against all order network entities that are part of the net requirements calculation of the planning system . The net requirements are calculated as follows :
Assume the following data for two items that are set up for order tracking .
&#124; &#124; Production BOM &#124; 1 qty. per of “ Component ” &#124;
&#124; &#124; Demand &#124; Sale for 100 units at BLUE location &#124;
# # # Entry Numbers 8 and 9
# # # Entry Numbers 10
At this point in the scenario , the 100 units of LOTA and LOTB are transferred to BLUE location by a transfer order .
&gt; Only the transfer order shipment is posted at this point , not the receipt .
Now the following order tracking entries exist in the * * Reservation Entry * * table .
# # # Entry Numbers 12 to 16
At this point in the scenario , the transfer order of the components from BLUE to RED location is posted as received .
# # # Entry Numbers 21 and 22
An action message addresses one BOM level at a time . If the user accepts the action message , this may give rise to additional action messages at the next BOM level .
The following table shows the action messages that exist .
1 . Check for any excess supply in the existing order tracking record for this demand .
2 . Check for planned and scheduled receipts in order of receipt date . The latest possible date is selected .
# # Order Tracking and Planning
When the planning system runs , it deletes all existing order tracking records and action message entries and recreates them as planning line suggestions according to supply / demand pairs and priorities . When the planning run has finished , the order network is in balance .
# # # Planning System versus Order Tracking and Action Messaging
The following comparison shows the differences between the methods that are used by the planning system to create planning line suggestions and the methods that are used by the order tracking system to create order tracking records and action messages .
- The planning system deals with all levels of the BOM hierarchy , whereas order tracking deals with one BOM level at a time .
- The planning system establishes links between demand and supply according to the prioritized due date . Order tracking establishes links between demand and supply according to the order entry sequence .
- The planning system takes planning parameters into account , whereas order tracking does not .

# Design Details : Known Item Application Issue
The article starts by listing typical symptoms of the issue , followed by the basics of item application to support the described reasons for this issue . At the end of the article is a workaround to address such open item ledger entries .
# # Symptoms of the Issue
Typical symptoms of the issue with zero inventory although open item ledger entries exist are the following :
- The following message when you try to close an inventory period : “ The inventory cannot be closed because there is negative inventory for one or more items . ”
- An item ledger entry situation where both an outbound item ledger entry and its related inbound item ledger entry are open .
See the following example of an item ledger entry situation .
# # Basics of Item Application
- For an inbound item ledger entry , the item application entry is created when the item ledger entry is created .
There are two types of item application :
The following diagram shows how quantity applications are made .
&gt; If the outbound item ledger entry is valued by average cost , then the applied inbound item ledger entry is not the unique cost source . It merely plays a part in the calculation of the average cost of the period .
The following diagram shows how cost applications are made .
# # Illustration of a Basic Cost Flow
Assume a complete cost flow where an item is received , is shipped and invoiced , is returned with exact \ -cost reversal , and is shipped again .
The following diagram illustrates the cost flow .
# # Reasons for the Issue
The issue with zero inventory although open item ledger entries exist can be caused by the following scenarios :
- Scenario 1 : A shipment and invoice is posted although the item is not available . The posting is then exact-cost reversed with a sales credit memo .
The following diagram illustrates how item applications are made in both scenarios .
To find out if the open item ledger entries are created , do as follows for the respective scenario :
For scenario 1 , identify the issue as follows :
For scenario 2 , identify the issue in either of the following ways :
For both scenarios , identify the involved cost application as follows :
3 . Analyze the item application entry , taking note of the following :
See the following example of an item application entry .
Notice above that inbound item ledger entry 334 is cost applied to outbound item ledger entry 333 .
# # Workaround for the Issue
- A positive adjustment to close the open outbound item ledger entry .
- A negative adjustment with the same quantity .
This adjustment balances the inventory increase caused by the positive adjustment and closes the open inbound item ledger entry .
The result is that inventory is zero and all item ledger entries are closed .

# Process Sales Returns or Cancellations
In addition to the original posted sales invoice , you can apply the sales credit memo or sales return order to other sales documents , for example another posted sales invoice because the customer is also returning items delivered with that invoice .
You can send the posted sales credit memo to the customer to confirm the return or cancellation and communicate that the related value will be reimbursed , for example when the items are returned .
To preserve correct inventory valuation , you typically want to put returned items back in inventory at the unit cost that they were sold at , not at their current unit cost . This is referred to as exact cost reversing .
# # To create a sales credit memo from a posted sales invoice
The sales credit memo header contains some information from the posted sales invoice . You can edit this , for example , with new information that reflects the return agreement .
3 . Edit information on the lines according to the agreement , such as the number of returned items or the amount to reimburse .
The identifier of the sales credit memo displays in the * * Applies-to ID * * field .
After you create or edit sales credit memo lines , and the single or multiple applications are specified , you can post the sales credit memo .
The posted sales documents that you applied the credit memo to are now reversed , and a refund payment can be created for the customer . The sales credit memo is removed and replaced with a new document in the list of posted sales credit memos .

&gt; This field only works for posted shipments and posted invoice lines , not for posted return or posted credit memo lines .
# # To create a replacement sales order from a sales return order
# # To create return-related documents from a sales return order
# # To create a restock charge
You may decide to charge your customer a restock fee to cover the physical handling costs of returning an item . This could occur if the customer mistakenly ordered the wrong item or changed their mind after receiving the item you sold them , for example .
You can post this increased cost as an item charge in a credit memo or a return order and assign it to the posted shipment . The following describes it for a sales return order , but the same steps apply to a sales credit memo .
When you post the sales return order , the restock charge is added to the relevant sales entry amount . In this way , you can maintain accurate inventory valuation .
# # To create a sales allowance
You can send a customer a credit memo with a price reduction if the customer has received slightly damaged items or received the items late .
You can post this reduced price as an item charge in a credit memo or a return order and assign it to the posted shipment . The following describes it for a sales credit memo , but the same steps apply to a sales return order .
3 . Fill in the credit memo header with relevant information about the customer that you want to give the sales allowance to .
You may want to create a special item charge number to cover sales allowances .
When you post the sales return order , the sales allowance is added to the relevant sales entry amount . In this way , you can maintain accurate inventory valuation .
# # To combine return receipts
You can combine return receipts if your customer returns several items that are covered by different sales return orders .
When you receive the items into your warehouse , post the relevant sales return orders as received . This creates posted return receipts .
When you are ready to invoice this customer , instead of invoicing each sales return order separately , you can create a sales credit memo and automatically copy the posted return receipt lines to this document . Then you can post the sales credit memo and conveniently invoice all the open sales return orders at once .
# # # To manually combine return receipts
5 . Select the return receipt lines that you want to include in the credit memo :
# # # To automatically combine return receipts
You can automatically combine return receipts and have the option of automatically posting the credit memos using the * * Combine Return Receipts * * function .
# # # To remove a received and invoiced return order
Alternatively , delete individual sales return orders manually .

To work more productively with dates and times , you can use any of the methods or formats that are described in the following sections .
# # # Picking dates from the calendar
# # # Day \ -week \ -year pattern
# # # Current work date
The work date feature allows you to record transactions using a date that is different from the current date .
If you have not defined a work date , the current date will be used as the work date . You may want to use a work date if you have many transactions with a date other than today &apos;s date .
When you close a fiscal year , you can use closing dates to indicate that an entry is a closing entry . A closing date technically is between two dates , for example between Dec 31 and Jan 1 .
&#124; `m` or `Monday` &#124; Monday of the work date week &#124;
&#124; `tu` or `Tuesday` &#124; Tuesday of the work date week &#124;
&#124; `sa` or `Saturday` &#124; Saturday of the work date week &#124;
&#124; `s` or `Sunday` &#124; Sunday of the work date week &#124;
&#124; `t23` &#124; Tuesday of week 23 of the work date year &#124;
A date formula is a short , abbreviated combination of letters and numbers that specifies how to calculate dates . You can enter date formulas in various date calculation fields or filters .
The date formula can contain a maximum of 20 characters , both numbers and letters . You can use the following letters , which are abbreviations for calendar units .
The following example shows how to use `C` , for current , and a time unit .
The following example shows how to use a number and a time unit . A number cannot be larger than 9999 .
The following example shows how to use a time unit and a number .
&#124; `D10` &#124; The next 10th day of a month &#124;
You only have to write the largest units that you require ; the rest will be set to zero . You can also leave out any AM / PM indicator .
# # Entering combined Dates and Times
It is also possible to enter only a date in a datetime field , but it is not possible to enter only a time .
Some fields in the application represent a duration , or amount of elapsed time , instead of a specific date or time . You enter a duration as a number followed by its unit of measure .
You can also enter a number , which will be automatically converted to a duration . The number you enter is converted according to the default unit of measure that has been specified for the duration field .
For example , if the unit of measure is hours , the number `5` is converted to 5 hrs .

You can fill customer fields on the sales invoice in two ways depending on whether the customer is already registered . See steps 2 and 3 in the following procedure .
# # To create a sales invoice
Several fields on the sales invoice are now filled with information that you specified on the new customer card .
You are now ready to fill in the sales invoice lines for products that you are selling to the customer or for any transaction with the customer that you want to record in a G / L account .

1 . Create the following table in Excel :
For our purposes , we only need to look at the language of the locale and not the region . If regional considerations were important , we could have included the full language tag value in the table above .
3 . Save the Excel file to your local file system .
Be aware that translated strings in other languages could be significantly longer than they are in your language . In many cases , the labels and other elements that display the strings in your user interface will need to be wider to accommodate .
This approach comes with some drawbacks when compared to the previous example which utilized a pre-translated table of text strings :
* The translation will be mechanical and may not be what you anticipate or be the best choice for the situation within your app .

# # # Connect to SharePoint lists
The lists are now displayed as tables in Query Editor .
# # # Remove unnecessary columns from the tables
# # # Change the data type on Project Details columns
# # # Change the data type on Project Requests columns
# # # Apply and save changes
# # Step 2 : Improve the data model
* Change how the two tables are related to each other
* Add a date table so we can make calculations based on weekdays
* Add calculated columns to calculate timespans between project milestones
* Add measures to calculate variance in projected versus actual days for a project
# # # Add a date table to make date-based calculations easier
# # # Add a calculated column to the Project Details table
2 . Enter this formula into the formula bar :
# # # Add a calculated column to the Project Requests table
# # # Add a measure to the Project Details table
This formula calculates the variance between actual and projected days for a project . We add this as a measure , rather than a calculated column , so it returns the correct results regardless of how the data is filtered or aggregated in a report .
# # # Add a measure to the Project Requests table
This formula finds the project that has been pending the longest , based on the calculated column we defined earlier .
# # Step 3 : Create report visualizations
* A column chart that shows projected days versus actual days on projects
* A column chart that shows the variance for each project
* A card that shows the project that has been pending the longest
* A table that shows the time between project approval and projected start date
5 . The visualization should now look like the following image .
The chart is now filtered to show only completed projects , which makes sense because we are comparing projected days to actual days .
# # # Create a bar chart to show variance from projected
1 . Click or tap on the canvas outside the visualization you just created .
The visualization should now look like the following image .
# # # Create a card that shows the longest pending project
After we publish this report , we &apos;ll use this tile to trigger an alert if the maximum value for a pending project reaches a certain threshold .

# ForAll function in Power Apps
The result of each formula evaluation is returned in a table , in the same order as the input table .
If the result of the formula is a single value , the resulting table will be a single-column table . If the result of the formula is a record , the resulting table contains records with the same columns as the result record .
# # # Copying a table
But before you make that copy , think carefully if it is needed . Many situations can be addressed by filtering and shaping the underlying data source on-demand with a formula . Some of the downsides to making a copy include :
* Two copies of the same information mean that one of them can fall out of sync .
Our goal is to work with a derivative table that includes only the items where more has been requested than is available , and for which we need to place an order :
We can perform this task in a couple of different ways , all of which produce the same result , with various pros and cons .
# # # # Table shaping on demand
Don &apos;t make that copy ! We can use the following formula anywhere we need :
And because we didn &apos;t make a copy , there is no additional copy of the information to manage or fall out of date .
# # # # ForAll on demand
This formula may be simpler for some people to read and write .
# # # # Collect the result
We use the same table shaping as the previous two examples , but we capture the result into a collection :

Each of these entities also contain a number of fields that represent common data that the system may need to store for the respective entity .
For most organizations it is to your advantage to use the standard entities and attributes for the purposes they were provided .
If you install a solution you can expect that the solution developer has leveraged the standard entities and attributes . Creating a new custom entity that replaces a system entity or attribute will mean that any solutions available may not work for your organization .

# Use Power BI with Common Data Service data
# Understand canvas-app tables and records in Power Apps
# # Elements of a table
A field is an individual piece of information in a record . You can visualize this sort of field as a value in a column for a particular record .
The column &apos;s name reflects the fields in that column .
You may have referred to columns as &quot; fields &quot; in other tools .
A table comprises one or more records , each with multiple fields that have consistent names across the records .
Any table that &apos;s stored in a data source or a collection has a name , which you use to refer to the table and pass it to functions that take tables as arguments . Tables can also be the result of a function or a formula .
You can also define a single-column table with square brackets . An equivalent way to write the above :
In Excel and Power Apps , you use formulas to manipulate numbers and strings of text in similar ways :
Let &apos;s walk through some simple examples .
&gt; Some controls have been rearranged and enlarged for illustration purposes .
# # Table functions and control properties
Properties of controls can also be tables :
2 . While holding down the Alt key , select the button .
You can also use a record as a general-purpose container for related named values .
In these cases , the record was never a part of a table .
# # Record functions and control properties
Functions that return records :
Some functions operate by evaluating a formula across all the records of a table individually . The formula &apos;s result is used in various ways :
To determine whether any of any of these products had more requested than is available :
Adding to this example , we can calculate how much of each product to order :
Finally , we can reduce the result table to just the columns that we want :
Let &apos;s put it all together . In this context , the following formula :
produces this table :
This formula produces this single-column table :
You express records by using curly braces that contain named field values . For example , you can express the first record in the table at the start of this topic by using this formula :
You can also embed formulas within other formulas , as this example shows :
You can nest records by nesting curly braces , as this example shows :
You can also nest tables :

title : &quot; Manage websites in portals &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
With a website providing an application scope , multiple distinct portal applications can be connected to a single organization .
&gt; Determination of which website record a given portal application is bound to is usually by the website &apos;s name , specified in the configuration of the portal deployment .
However , it is also possible to control this by domain name or website bindings .
Websites are created when you create a new portal . However , advanced website management can be performed from the Portal Management app .
4 . Enter or edit appropriate values in the fields .
&#124; Name &#124; The descriptive name of the website . This field is required . &#124;
&#124; Owner &#124; The owner contact record for the selected Websites record .

# # # Show a set of images from a data source
* Consider checking for contrast issues within the image , if it is not purely decorative .
Converts letters in a string of text to all lowercase , all uppercase , or proper case .
All three functions ignore characters that aren &apos;t letters .
Each formula returns a single-column table that contains the converted strings .
# Validate function in Power Apps
Before a user submits a data change , you can provide immediate feedback on the validity of that submission , resulting in a better user experience .
Data sources can provide information on what constitutes valid values within a record . This information can include many constraints , such as these examples :
* whether a column requires a value
* how high and low a number can be
* how early and late a date can be
# # # Validate with a single column
# # # Validate with a complete record
The real-time location data sent by the field service mobile app is used to support the following scenarios :

# Query and visualize hierarchically related data
You can get valuable business insights by visualizing hierarchically related data . The hierarchical modelling and visualization capabilities give you a number of benefits :
- View and explore complex hierarchical information .
- View key performance indicators ( KPIs ) in the contextual view of a hierarchy .
- Visually analyze key information across the web and the tablets .
The following examples illustrate various scenarios for querying hierarchies :
Query account hierarchy
Query account hierarchy , including related activities
Query account hierarchy , including related opportunities
To query the data as a hierarchy , you must set one of the entity ’ s one-to-many or many-to-one self-referential relationships as hierarchical . To turn the hierarchy on :
4 . Select a self-referential relationship .
&gt; - Some of the out-of the-box relationships can ’ t be customized . This will prevent you from setting those relationships as hierarchical .
If you select the hierarchy icon , you can view the hierarchy , with the tree view on the left and the tile view on the right , as shown below :
&gt; If an entity can be enabled for a hierarchy :
- Presently , a hierarchy or visualization is based on one entity only . You can depict the account hierarchy showing accounts at multiple levels , but you can ’ t show accounts and contacts in the same hierarchy visualization .
- Maximum number of fields that can be displayed in a tile is four . If you add more fields to the Quick Form that is used for the tile view , only the first four fields will be displayed .
&gt; The hierarchy icons don ’ t appear in the record grid view until the records are paired in the parent – child relationship .

# Walkthrough : Configuring additional entities for global search
You can enable additional entities for search functionality . Configuring search for additional entities requires additional actions , which are described in this article .
Following considerations apply when configuring additional entities for global search :
The explicit configuration explained above ensures that no records will accidentally be made available via global search .
# # # Site setting for additional entities
# # # Results page for additional entities
Ensure that your search results page has an entity form , or has logic written to show the search result details .
# # Walkthrough - configure search for additional entities with sample database
# # Step 1 : Add or update search site settings
1 . Ensure that you &apos;re in the appropriate environment where your portal exists .
# # Step 2 : Create or verify the Portal Search view
1 . Ensure appropriate columns are added to the view for search .
# # Step 3 : Create entity permissions
# # Step 6 : Rebuild the search index
1 . Browse your portal by using a user account that has the Administrator web role assigned .
# # Step 7 : Verify that global search works with the custom entity
1 . Go to the search toolbar or the search page , and search for a known record .

There are some fields used by the system that you cannot add using the designer .
Multi-select option set is only available in read-only grids , editable grids , and forms . Multi-select option set is not supported in :
Multi-select fields are supported in the following types of forms :
You can use global option sets that are defined in your organization to configure values for the multi-select option sets .
# # Using the right type of number
Decimal numbers are stored in the database exactly as specified . Floating point numbers store an extremely close approximation of the value . Why choose extremely close approximation when you can have the exact value ? The answer is that you get different system performance .
Use decimals when you need to provide reports that require very accurate calculations , or if you typically use queries that look for values that are equal or not equal to another value .
Individuals can also change their personal options to select a default currency for the records they create .
When you configure a currency field you can choose the precision value . There are three options as shown in the following table .
&#124; Currency Precision &#124; This option applies the precision defined for the currency in the record . &#124;
# # Different types of lookups
However , you should be aware that not every lookup behaves this way . There are several different types of system lookups as shown here .
Even though an entity has an image field , displaying that image in a model-driven app requires that you enable two settings .
When image display is enabled for an entity , any records that don ’ t have an image will display a placeholder image . For example :
People can choose the default image to upload a picture from their computer . Images must be less than 10 MB and must be in one of the following formats :
# # # Add image support for a form in a custom entity using solution explorer
8 . Open the form where you want image support , such as the entity main form .
&gt; Once the maximum file size has been saved , it can &apos;t be changed .
App users can now select the image to display on the form . When an app user opens the form for a record , they can choose the image that they want displayed on the form .
Once an entity form has an image field , app users can change the image for a given record .

title : &quot; Configure header properties in the form designer &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# Configure header properties in the form designer
Makers can control the density of model-driven app form headers to match the needs of anyone using the form .
To ensure that key information is always visible , the framework displays read-only field values and users can &apos;t directly edit the field values in the header . Visualizations such as custom components or web resources also aren &apos;t allowed .
When a form does not specify header density or when a new form is created , the framework defaults to high-density header .
Low density form header allows users to directly edit the field values in the header . It also allows visualizations such as custom components and web resources .
To configure the header density of a model-driven form , follow these steps :
&gt; Use the new form designer . The classic form designer does not provide the ability to configure the header density .
The header flyout is displayed when users select the chevron in the form header . It enables users to edit field values and also displays visualizations such as custom components or web resources that are a part of the form header .
The behavior of the header flyout changes depending on the header density configuration .
With a high-density form header , the header flyout displays all header fields including the four fields that are directly displayed in the header . The framework defaults to show the header flyout when high-density header is being used . Makers can control the visibility of the header flyout with a high-density header .
# # # Show or hide the header flyout
To show or hide the header flyout for a model-driven form , follow these steps :
&gt; - Use the new form designer . The classic form designer does not provide the ability to show or hide the header flyout .
When you edit forms using the new or classic form designer , you might see messages related to form headers . Below , you can find details on each message and why you are seeing it .
This message is displayed in the form designer when a maker creates a new main form ( including via the Save-as action ) or edits a main form that has not previously been configured for header density .
The framework defaults to high-density header and this message helps makers become aware of that behavior . Makers can override the framework default at any time by manually configuring the form header density as outlined earlier .
This message is displayed in the form designer when a maker opens a main form for editing that is configured to use low-density header .
The message helps increase awareness about the high-density header and its benefits .
This message is displayed in the form designer when a form is using high-density header with the header flyout visible .
High-density header displays read-only values of the first four fields in the header . When makers add a field in the header in the top four positions , it causes an existing field that was directly displayed in the header to become extended and visible only in the header flyout .
The message informs the maker of the change and confirms whether to proceed with the action .
This message is displayed in the form designer when a form is using high-density header with the header flyout hidden .
High-density header displays read-only values of up to four fields in the header . Because the header flyout is hidden , users will be unable to see the additional fields .
The message informs the maker that there are already four fields in the header and prevents adding additional fields in the header that users will not be able to see .
High-density header displays read-only values of fields in the header . Because the header flyout is hidden , users will be unable to see any custom components associated with the fields in the header .
The message informs the maker that they are trying to add a field with an associated custom component to the header and they must remove the custom component before adding the field to the header . This is because users won &apos;t be able to see the custom component in the header .
High-density header displays read-only values of fields in the header . Because the header flyout is hidden , users will be unable to edit field values .
The message informs the maker that any fields added to the header will be read-only and that any fields they want users to edit should also be added to a section in the form .
This message is displayed in the form designer only for forms using high-density header with the header flyout hidden .
This message is displayed in the classic form designer when a maker opens a main form for editing and it is configured to use low density header .
This message helps increase awareness about the high density header and its benefits and that makers should use the new form designer to configure header density .
# # # This form is using high density header . For the best authoring experience with this form , use the new form designer .
The message informs the maker that when editing a form that is using high-density header , they should use the new form designer . This helps ensure the maker is aware of the impact of their changes to the form header .

# How to customize an app screen based on column status inside SharePoint list ?
Limiting access to SharePoint objects can be achieved using fine-grained permissions inside SharePoint . However , it becomes difficult to scan through all items in your app screen especially when using different devices .
One of the most common problems is how to limit the items in a canvas app screen based on status of columns , instead of controlling access using the permissions .
This method allows you to create multiple screens to show different SharePoint objects based on column status , while at the same time without customizing permissions or overwhelming the app user with the entire list .
- You need two user accounts with access to the app and SharePoint site hosting the lists .
- You need to be knowledgeable about how to configure SharePoint lists and list / item permissions .
Ensure the issue items have both * Active * and * Closed * items .
1 . Share the list with user , for example Kenny Smith .
1 . You can see all issues listed in the app inside the studio .

# Share an embedded canvas app
This topic explains how to share an embedded canvas app that you have already created .
After you have created and added an embedded canvas app to a model-driven form you will need to take steps to ensure that all users that have access to the model-driven form also have access to the canvas app and the data that it uses . Please refer to the following guidelines :
Embedded canvas apps are also solution aware . By default embedded canvas apps are created in the same solution as the host model-driven form . To move the embedded canvas app from one environment to another export and import embedded canvas apps as a part of a solution just like any other component .

title : &quot; Pass the current record as data context with an embedded canvas app &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# Pass the current record as data context to an embedded canvas app
&gt; Canvas apps embedded on model-driven forms are now out of preview and generally available . The steps listed below are outdated and applicable only to the public preview release of canvas apps embedded on model-driven forms .
This topic explains how to add an embedded canvas app and pass the current ( main form ) record as a data context to the embedded canvas app .
Imagine that you want to add an embedded canvas app on an account main form and pass the current account record to the embedded canvas app . To do this , follow these steps :
9 . In the section below the controls list , the list of properties available to the canvas app control are displayed .
- Saving an app for the first time automatically publishes the app .
# # Get started : solution concepts
Before you work with solutions , it &apos;s important that you get acquainted with the following solution concepts :
- Two types of solutions ( managed and unmanaged )
- Solution and solution component dependencies
# # Work with solutions in Power Apps
From the * * Solutions * * area , select a solution to view all of its components .
# # Search and filter in a solution
You can also search for a specific component by its name .
Or filter all items in the list by the component type .
As you select each component , the actions available in the command bar will change depending on the type of the component you have selected and if the solution is the default or a managed one .
When you don &apos;t select any component , the command bar will show actions applied to the solution itself .
The following limitations apply to the use of canvas apps , flows , and custom connectors in solutions .
- The app and flow will not currently be connected in the target environment post deployment . First associate valid connections with the flow and activate the flow . Then edit the app and re-associate the flow to the button .
- Canvas apps won &apos;t display in the classic solution explorer . Use the modern experience . There are no plans for them to be added to classic solution explorer .
- Deleting a managed solution does not rollback to a different canvas app version . Instead , all versions of the app are deleted .
- Importing a solution containing a flow will not automatically create or associate required connections . The flow must be edited to fix the connections .
- If using managed solutions , this creates an active customization in the unmanaged layer . Therefore subsequent solution updates to the flow will not be reflected .
- Flows triggered from Microsoft 365 applications such as Excel are not available in solutions .
- Flows that connect to SharePoint are not available in solutions .
- Flows in solutions don &apos;t support delegated authentication . For example , access to a flow is not automatically granted based on having access to the SharePoint list the flow was created from .
- Custom connectors created outside solutions cannot be added to solutions at this time .
For details about customizing the individual components in a solution , see the following topics :

title : &quot; Import solutions &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
You can manually import solutions using the steps in this article . You must import only those solutions that you &apos;ve obtained from a trusted source . Customizations might include code that can send data to external sources .
When you import an * * unmanaged * * solution :
- You add all the components of that solution into your environment and can &apos;t delete the components by deleting the solution . Deleting the unmanaged solution deletes only the solution container .
- That contains components you have already customized , your customizations will be overwritten by the customizations in the imported unmanaged solution . You can ’ t undo this .
To import a solution :
If you have imported any changes that require publishing , you must publish customizations before they are available .
When you download the log file , you will find an XML file that you can open using Office Excel to view the contents .

# Test Studio ( experimental )
The following section explains key Test Studio terminology .
In the expense app example above , you can write an assertion to validate whether an expense report is created with an expense line item having zero cost associated .
When testing canvas apps using Test Studio , consider the following best practices to gain maximum benefits to improve your app quality :
It &apos;s difficult to automate all tests and we do not recommend that you completely rely on test automation . Manual testing should be performed in addition to test automation . Tests best suited to automation are :
- Repetitive tests .
- High business impact functionality tests .
- Features that are stable and not undergoing significant change .
- Features that require multiple data sets .
- Manual testing that takes significant time and effort .
A test action can contain multiple expressions . Large multi-action test expressions for a single step might impact your ability to debug and isolate any test failures . Consider dividing a test step with multiple actions into more test steps of single actions to identify issues faster .
For maintenance , group or categorize similar test cases together and describe the purpose and expected results of your test .
- Nested galleries .
- Formula-level error management experimental feature needs to be turned on for the app .
- Person-type columns .
# Create responsive layouts in canvas apps
# # Disable Scale to fit
You can configure each screen so that its layout adapts to the actual space in which the app is running .
To make your app responsive , you must take additional steps , but this change is the first step toward making responsiveness possible .
# # Understand app and screen dimensions
# # Use formulas for dynamic layout
In the simplest case , one control fills an entire screen . To create this effect , set the control &apos;s properties to these values :
Set the properties for these controls to these values :
# # Adapting layout for device size and orientation
# # # Screen sizes and breakpoints
This formula sets the control &apos;s width to half of the screen width on a small screen , three-tenths of the screen width on a medium screen , and a quarter of the screen width on all other screens .
The authoring canvas doesn &apos;t respond to the sizing formulas created . To test responsive behavior , save and publish your app , and then open it on devices or in browser windows of various sizes and orientations .
# GUID function in Power Apps
The string passed can contain uppercase or lowercase letters , but it must be 32 hexadecimal digits in either of these formats :
If you don &apos;t specify an argument , this function creates a new GUID .
To convert a GUID value to a string , simply use it in a string context . The GUID value will be converted to a hexadecimal representation string with hyphens and lowercase letters .
# # # # Basic usage
To return a GUID value based on the hexadecimal string representation :
You can also provide the GUID string without hyphens . This formula returns the same GUID value :
1 . While holding down the Alt key , select the button by clicking or tapping it .
The data table shows a list of GUIDs :
1 . Select the button again to show a different list of GUIDs :

title : &quot; Tutorial to add or edit model-driven app components with Power Apps &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# Tutorial : Add or edit model-driven app components in the Power Apps app designer
In this tutorial you learn how to add components to and remove components from a model-driven app .
The app designer has two main areas . On the left side is the canvas where you add app components .
On the right side are tabs that you &apos;ll use to select components and set component properties .
Here are the steps for adding a dashboard to the app . Use the same steps to add a business process flow or entity .
On the app designer canvas , the rightmost pane shows you dashboards that are available in the default solution .
&gt; Alternatively , you can also do one of the following :
The dashboard list will be filtered to show results that match your keywords .
With the artifacts in place , you can start adding entity assets like forms , views , charts , and dashboards to the app .
Additionally , if you &apos;re using the Unified Interface client , you can also add entity dashboard assets to the app .
This section describes the steps for adding a form to the app . Use the same steps to add a view or chart to the app .
On the app designer canvas , the entire row for the entity is selected . On the right side , you &apos;ll see all existing forms for the selected entity .
The form tile of the selected entity will display the number of forms added .
&gt; The drop-down list is available only when you &apos;re adding forms . It isn &apos;t available for views and charts .
5 . Repeat these steps to add entity views and charts to the app .
# # Edit or remove artifacts
The designer for the selected artifact opens .
&gt; When you make any changes to an entity &amp; mdash ; like changing an entity display name or description &amp; mdash ; the changes don &apos;t appear in the app designer unless the changes are published in the solution explorer .
# # Edit or remove entity assets
# # # Edit entity assets
# # # Remove entity assets
# Combo box control in Power Apps
A control that allows users to make selections from provided choices . Supports search and multiple selections .
Single or multi-select mode is configured via the SelectMultiple property .
When viewing on small screens , the items list flyout will become a full screen control for better usablility .
The control shows the data from the column that you specified in the data source that you specified .
&gt; On touch screens , screen reader users can navigate the contents of the combo box sequentially . The combo box acts as a button that shows or hides its contents when selected .
&gt; The tab key navigates to or away from the combo box . Arrow keys navigate the contents of the combo box . The escape key closes the drop down when opened .

title : &quot; Add and configure a quick view component on a form &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# # Add a quick view component
# # Configure a quick view component
These are the properties available to configure when using a quick view component on a form using the form designer .
- List of organizations in the Tenant
- Usage data of end users – such as time spent on Learning Paths or clicks recorded
- Aggregated end-user data – Location , security role , user language
- Verbatim feedback from end users
- Controls that are created by using Learning Path .
- Configuration-related Learning Path Authoring .
# Custom connectors for canvas apps
# Add record-based security by using entity permissions for portals
# # Add entity permissions to a web role
&gt; Selecting entities like webpage , web files and other configuration entities is invalid and might have other unintended consequences . The portal will assert the security of configuration entities based on content access controls , not entity permissions .
Users in a web role who have access to records defined by parent entity permissions will also have rights as defined by the child permission record to records related to the parent record .
The table below explains the entity permission attributes .
&#124; Name &#124; The descriptive name of the record . This field is required . &#124;
&#124; Entity Name &#124; The logical name of the entity that is to be secured or that will define the contact relationship or parent relationship to secure a related entity on a child permission . This field is required . &#124;
&#124; Parent Relationship &#124; Required only if a parent entity permission is assigned . The schema name of the relationship between the entity specified by the Entity Name field and the entity specified by the Entity Name field on its Parent Entity Permission record . &#124;
&#124; Parent Entity Permission &#124; Required only if Scope = Parent . &#124;
&#124; Write &#124; Privilege that controls whether the user can update a record . &#124;
&#124; Delete &#124; Privilege that controls whether the user can delete a record . &#124;
# # Global permissions for tasks related to leads
This role has a related Entity Permission for the Lead entity , with a Global scope .
Users in this role can access all leads via entity lists or forms on the portal .
After these permissions are in place , users in the Lead Manager role can access leads that are related to them directly as specified by the contact-scope permission , and access tasks related to those same leads as specified by the child permission record .
When you use Power Query for Excel to create a custom entity that contains data from external sources , this error might appear :
To resolve this issue , the Azure Active Directory administrator must follow either of the procedures that are presented later in this article .
# # Allow users to consent to apps that access company data
This approach is perhaps easier than the next , but it allows for broader permissions .
# # Allow Power Query to access company data
As an alternative , the tenant administrator can give consent to Power Query without modifying tenant-wide permissions .
2 . Run the following PowerShell commands :
* Login-AzureRmAccount ( and sign in as the tenant admin )
In Power Apps , you access the Query Editor by doing the following :
To remove mashups from Power Apps :
1 . Remove the Data Integrator projects , which can be removed from the namesake tab .
After you confirm that you want to delete your queries , they are deleted .
To export personal data , users can do the following :
System-generated logs about user actions on the user interface ( UI ) can be accessed in the Azure portal .
# Slider control in Power Apps
A control with which the user can specify a value by dragging a handle .
The user can indicate a value , between a minimum and a maximum value that you specify , by dragging the handle of a slider left-right or up-down , depending on the direction that you choose .
8 . To return to the default workspace , press Esc .
* Slider value must be shown when interacting with the keyboard . This can be achieved by any one of these methods :
# Add , configure , move , or delete components on a form
# # Add components to a form
# # # Add components to a form using drag and drop
Note the following :
- Components can be dropped before or after any existing component or field .
- Components can also be dropped in the empty area within a section . In this case the component will be added in an available space so as to evenly distribute fields and components across the section columns .
- Hovering over a tab header when dragging a component changes the currently selected tab , allowing you to add the component to a different tab .
6 . Repeat steps 3-5 above to add more components .
# # # Add components for a field on the form
2 . In the form preview , select an existing field .
In most cases , a dialog is displayed so you can configure the properties of the component . Ensure that you have configured all the required properties of the component .
7 . Repeat steps 2-6 above if you want to add more components to the same or another field .
# # Configure components on a form
# # Move components on a form
You can move components on a form by either drag-and-drop or cut-and-paste actions .
# # # Move components on a form using drag and drop
4 . Repeat steps 2-3 above to move more components .
# # # Move components on a form using cut and paste
2 . In the form preview , select the component that you want to move .
6 . Repeat steps 2-5 above if you want to move more components .
# # Delete components on a form
3 . Repeat step 2 if you want to delete more components .
&gt; - You can &apos;t delete a component that is locked or is using a required field that is not present anywhere else on the form .
Azure components and services that are involved with Relevance Search functionality are detailed in the following sections .
- Configuration data related to the organization and the corresponding index
- Metadata relating to the search service and indexes
- Pointers to system metadata and data when synchronizing changes
- Authorization data to enable enhanced row- level security
# What are model-driven apps in Power Apps ?
Model-driven app design provides the following benefits :
- Rich component-focused no-code design environments
- Create complex responsive apps with a similar UI across a variety of devices from desktop to mobile
- Your app can be distributed as a solution
# # The approach to model-driven app making
At a fundamental level , model-driven app making consists of three key focus areas .
- Modeling business data
- Defining business processes
- Composing the app
# # # Modeling business data
# # # Defining business processes
# # # Composing the model-driven app
# Using quick find to search for records
Single-entity quick find is used to find records of only one type . This search option is available from within a view .
# # Multiple-entity quick find ( categorized search )
Multiple-entity quick find is also known as categorized search .
With categorized search , you can search for records that begin with a specific word or use a wildcard character .
&gt; Using a wildcard at the beginning of your quick find ( single or multiple-entity ) search query might result in slower performance .
# # Filter categorized search results
&gt; Apps and flows that use these entities require the app and flow user to be licensed appropriately-not the maker or developer of the app or flow .
# # Entities with complex business logic
# # # Impacting license requirements when adding complex business logic
Isaac is creating two model-driven apps :
Barb and Isaac need the following licenses :
App users need the following licenses :
# Set function in Power Apps
Sets the value of a global variable .
As the examples later in this topic show , global variables can hold several kinds of information , including these :
* a single value
* a record
* a table
* an object reference
* any result from a formula
A global variable holds its value until the app is closed . Once closed , the global variable &apos;s value will be lost and must be recreated when the app is loaded again .
# User guide for model-driven apps running on the Power Apps mobile app
It &apos;s easy to get around in the Power Apps mobile app . The following illustration shows the primary navigation elements on the Home screen .
The following illustration shows the primary navigation elements on the site map screen .

# Show a list of items in Power Apps
- Set up the sample data :
- Open a blank app :
# # Add a gallery to a blank screen
# # Add a gallery in a screen
The * * Gallery * * control shows the sample data .
# # Add a control to the Gallery control
The * * Gallery * * control shows the new values .
# # Filter and sort a gallery
1 . Double-click the search box , and then type part or all of a product name in it .
Only those items that meet the filter criterion appear .
The records toggle between ascending and descending alphabetical order based on the product name .
# # Highlight the selected item
# # Change the default selection
# Reference information about the meeting-screen template for canvas apps
# # Text search box
Several other controls in the screen have a dependency on this one :
This control allows users to add people who don &apos;t exist inside their org to the attendee list for the meeting being composed .
At a low level , this code block :
# # # People browse gallery Title
Displays the person &apos;s display name from their Office 365 profile .
Value : Logic to allow the gallery to grow to a maximum height of 350 :
When the maximum height of the gallery is reached ( 350 ) , the scroll bar is visible .
# # # Meeting people gallery Title
# # # Meeting people gallery iconRemove
At a high level , selecting this control removes the person from the attendee list and refreshes the available meeting times based on the removal of this person .
# # Meeting date picker
# # Find meeting times gallery
# # # Find meeting times gallery Title
Value : A conversion of the start time to be displayed in the user &apos;s local time :
Value : Logically set to two internal collections of identical schema , depending on whether the user has selected a room list or has rooms lists in their tenant :
The gallery is visible only if the three preceding statements evaluate to * * true * * .
At a low level , the preceding code block :
This control is visible only if both a room list has been selected and the * * Schedule * * tab is selected .
Value : Logic to force user to input certain meeting details before the icon becomes editable .
Value : Code to send the meeting invite to your selected attendees and clear all the input fields :
1 . Resets all of the input fields and variables used in creating the meeting .
Boolean logic functions , commonly used to manipulate the results of comparisons and tests .

# Create and manage website bindings
Website bindings can be created , edited , and deleted within Power Apps portals .
4 . To edit an existing website binding , select the website binding name .
# # # Website binding attributes
These are the attributes common to all bindings .
&#124; Name &#124; A title to identify the website binding when viewing the records . &#124;
&#124; Release Date &#124; A date that determines when the website is allowed to be selected . &#124;
&#124; Expiration Date &#124; A date that determines when the website will stop being selected . &#124;
&#124; Site Name &#124; The name of the IIS website . &#124;
&#124; Virtual Path &#124; The name of the IIS application under the website . &#124;
# Container control in Power Apps ( experimental )
Provides the ability to create hierarchy .
&gt; This is an experimental feature . Experimental features can radically change or completely disappear at any time .
The container can hold a set of controls and has its own properties .
Containers don &apos;t work within forms .
The authoring group is a lightweight concept used for moving around controls and bulk editing similar properties of controls within the group . The authoring group doesn &apos;t affect the layout of the app .
The container control previously shipped in experimental as a replacement for the authoring group renamed as the enhanced group . It was renamed to the container control as there &apos;s value in both a lightweight authoring group and a structured container control with additional properties .

# Add a report from outside Power Apps
If you ’ ve created a custom report outside of the system , you can easily add it to Power Apps .
1 . From the left navigation pane , select the reports area .
* * Add a file created in another application * *
* * Add a link to a webpage * *
3 . Specify the properties for the report .
If no values are selected , the report won ’ t be visible to end users .
title : Create a summary form in a canvas app &#124; Microsoft Docs
# Create a summary form in a canvas app
# # Add a title bar
Across the top of the app , create a title bar , which will hold action buttons by the end of this topic .
1 . Move and resize the new label to span the top of the screen :
- Increase the font size to 24 points .
- Make the text bold .
- Make the text white .
- Add a dark-blue fill to the background .
# # Add an Edit form control
In this section , you &apos;ll add controls to show a summary of any order that the user selects in the gallery .
By default , the form appears in the upper-left corner , where other controls might make it difficult to find :
1 . Move and resize the form to cover the upper-right corner of the screen under the title bar :
# # Add and arrange fields
1 . Scroll down until these fields appear , and then select their check boxes :
The form shows seven fields , which may be in a different order :
This step adds flexibility as you arrange the fields :
1 . Move and resize the fields by dragging their handles , just as you would any other control , so that each row contains these data cards in the specified order :
All selected controls disappear from the form :
# # Connect the order gallery
The form shows an summary of whatever order the app user selects in the list .
# # Replace a data card
The user can no longer change the order number :
# # Use a many-to-one relationship
1 . In the data card , reduce the width of the combo box to make room for the employee picture :
An image appears in the data card , which expands to accommodate it :
1 . Resize the image , and move it to the right of the combo box :
1 . While holding down the Alt key , select a different employee in the combo box to confirm that the picture also changes .
# # Add a Save icon
The user can save changes to an order by selecting the Check icon , which is then disabled and dimmed until the user makes another change :
# # Add a Cancel icon
The icon appears in the upper-left corner by default , where other controls might make the icon difficult to find :
The user can cancel changes to an order , and the Check and Cancel icons are disabled and dimmed if all changes have been saved :
# # Add an Add icon
The formula disables the Add icon under these conditions :
- The user makes changes but doesn &apos;t save or cancel them , which is the opposite behavior from the Check and Cancel icons .
- The user selects the Add icon but makes no changes .
The user can create an order if they make no changes or they save or cancel any changes they &apos;ve made . ( If the user selects this icon , they can &apos;t select it again until they make one or more changes and then save or cancel those changes ) :
&gt; If you create and save an order , you might need to scroll down in the order gallery to show your new order . It won &apos;t have a total price because you haven &apos;t added any order details yet .
# # Add a Trash icon
The user can delete an order .
To recap , you added a form in which the user can show and edit a summary of each order , and you used these elements :
Internet-facing deployment ( IFD )
title : &quot; Define entity forms &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# # Add a form to your portal
The entity form contains relationships to webpages and additional properties to control the initialization of the form within the portal . The relationship to webpages allows dynamic retrieval of the form definition for a given page node within the website .
&gt; - If you create an entity form in the Insert mode , you can &apos;t change a button &apos;s alignment or place an action button above the entity form .
&gt; - If you render a lookup control as a dropdown list on the form , the related records filter does not work .

&gt; It is advisable to only disable custom errors when you are in the development phase and enable custom errors once you go live .
# # # Disable custom error
You can disable custom errors on portals to display the detailed exception message if any server-side exception occurs in your portal .
# # # Enable custom error
&gt; - You must not enable or disable custom errors when the instance that your portal is connected to is being changed ; otherwise an error message appears .
# # # Display a custom error message
You can configure your portal to display a professional-looking custom error instead of a generic error .
&gt; If liquid code is written in the content snippet , it will be skipped and not rendered .
When you enable custom errors , the message appears in the following structure on the error page :
Below is an example of a custom error message , using a content snippet of type HTML :
This is a custom error , please file a support ticket with screenshot of error by clicking here
# # Access portal error logs
By default , the retention period is 30 days .
When diagnostic logging is enabled successfully , the following action becomes available :
3 . In the Update diagnostic logging configuration window , enter the following values :
Following are the screens where custom plugin errors will appear :
- Retrieval of records
- Create / Update and so on
If the site setting is not present , then it will be treated as false by default and plugin errors will not render .
# Create and edit global option sets for Common Data Service using solution explorer
Solution explorer provides one way to Create and edit global option sets for Common Data Service .
# # View global option sets
# # Create a global option set
# # Edit a global option set
While viewing global option sets , select the option set you want to edit to open the panel to edit it .
&gt; You cannot edit an option set if it is part of a managed solution . To edit managed solution option sets , you will have to contact the solution owner .
# # Delete a global option set
&gt; If the global option set has been used by a field , you will not be able to delete it until that field is deleted .
# Create a business rule for an entity
By combining conditions and actions , you can do any of the following with business rules :
* Set field values
* Clear field values
* Set field requirement levels
* Show or hide fields
* Enable or disable fields
* Validate data and show error messages
* Create business recommendations based on business intelligence .
# # Differences between canvas and model-driven apps
# # Create a business rule
The Business Rule designer window opens with a single condition already created for you . Every rule starts with a condition . The business rule takes one or more actions based on that condition .
&gt; If you want to modify an existing business rule , you must deactivate it before you can modify it .
5 . Add a description , if you want , in the description box in the upper-left corner of the window .
&gt; If you &apos;re building a Canvas app , you must use Entity as the scope .
&gt; Here are a few tips to keep in mind as you work on business rules in the designer window :
&gt; - Use the mini-map to navigate quickly to different parts of the process . This is useful when you have a complicated process that scrolls off the screen .
# # Localize error messages used in business rules
# RequestHide function in Power Apps
* No parameters .
# Add mixed reality components to your canvas app ( Preview )
You can add a number of mixed reality ( MR ) components to your canvas app to support multiple 3D and mixed reality scenarios .
Components are groups of controls that can answer the need for a specific scenario . For example , you can use these MR components to :
- View and manipulate 3D content .
- Overlay 3D content and 2D images onto the feed from the camera .
- Measure distance , area , and volume using your device with MR .
- Identify spaces in the real world through an MR overlay .
The following prebuilt components can be used for mixed reality scenarios :
# # # Enable the mixed reality features for each app
For each app you create , you need to enable the mixed reality features :
4 . Return to editing your app by selecting the back arrow icon .
Start installing the components in your apps :
title : &quot; Relevance Search &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
Relevance search delivers fast and comprehensive results across multiple entities , in a single list , sorted by relevance .
Relevance search brings the following enhancements and benefits :
- Improved performance compared to Categorized search .
- Finds matches to any word in the search term in any field in the entity , compared to quick find where all words from the search term must be found in one field .
- Highlights matches in the results list . When a search term matches a term in a record , the term appears as bold and italicized text in your search results .
&gt; - Highlighted terms are often returned as a portion of the full value in a field because only the matched terms are highlighted .
- Enables you to search for records that are shared with you and records that you own .
# # Switch between relevance search and categorized search
If your organization has turned on both search options ( relevance search and categorized search ) , you can switch between the two .
# # Set a default search experience
If your organization has turned on both search options , you can select a default search experience in your personal settings .
# # Filter records with facets
With Common Data Service , you can now refine your search results by using facets and filters . Facets and filters let you drill into and explore the results of your current search without having to repeatedly refine your search terms .
Facets are available in the leftmost pane . Immediately after you perform a search , the following global facets are available for four common fields :
# # # Record Type facets
Search results that are found in email attachments or appointment entities are shown in the search results under their parent record , either Email or Appointment .
# # # Date and Time facets
# # Configure facets and filters
&gt; A system customizer can set the default experience for all entities , but you can configure your own facets and filters .
title : &quot; Configure a contact for use on a portal &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;

Preview features aren ’ t meant for production use and may have restricted functionality . These features are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback .
# Create and edit global option sets overview
You can define an option set to use a set of options defined within itself ( locally ) or it can use a set of options defined elsewhere ( globally ) which can be used by other option set fields .
There are two designers you can use to create or edit global option sets :
&gt; You can also create global option sets in your environment using the following :
&gt; - Import a solution that contains the definition of the global option sets .
Information in this topic will help you choose which designer you can use .
- Assign colors to options
- Change the order of options
- Create a global option set in a solution other than the Common Data Service Default solution
- Set managed properties
- Set properties used for virtual entities
- View dependencies

# Create and edit One-to-many or Many-to-one entity relationships using Power Apps portal
Depending on your choice you will see either :
&gt; With either choice , a lookup field will be created on the * current * entity .
Once you select the entity you can edit the details of the relationship . In this example , multiple contact entity records can be associated with a single account .
&gt; The publisher of a managed solution can prevent some customizations of relationships that are part of their solution .
Deleting the relationship will delete the lookup field on the related entity .

- A list rendered as a calendar control or map isn &apos;t configurable through Power Apps portals Studio .
- The Partial URL field in page properties doesn &apos;t accept special characters and it breaks the rendering in the canvas for some time .
- Upload CSS might fail in scenarios where CSS file name contains special characters or space in the file name .
- Unpublished webpages don &apos;t render in canvas of Power Apps portals Studio .
- Power Apps portals Studio is currently not supported on Safari in Mac operating system and has the following issues :
- The selection of component isn &apos;t correct and hovering on a component provides incorrect target indication .
- Two or three column sections don &apos;t render properly in Power Apps portals Studio but works fine on the website .
# Patch function in Power Apps
To use this function with a data source , specify the data source , and then specify a base record :
Then specify one or more change records , each of which contains new property values that override property values in the base record . Change records are processed in order from the beginning of the argument list to the end , with later property values overriding earlier ones .
# # # Modify or create a set of records in a data source
# # # Merge records outside of a data source
Specify two or more records that you want to merge . Records are processed in the order from the beginning of the argument list to the end , with later property values overriding earlier ones .
# # # # Merge records
After the previous formulas have been evaluated , the data source ends with these values :
# Show , edit , or add a record in a canvas app
You can add a form to a tablet app , but it won &apos;t match this article because the form will have three columns by default .

# Create and manage page templates
When creating a new web page for the site , whether through front-side publishing or through the portal interface , you must select a page template which will present the page &apos;s content to users of the portal .
Creating a new Page Template is only necessary when creating a brand new .aspx page to display content on your website , a portal developer ’ s task . In fact , for the purposing of simply customizing the layout of your site , a portal developer can largely just modify existing .aspx pages .
4 . To edit an existing page template , select the page template name .
# # # Page template attributes
&#124; Name &#124; Name of the template used for reference . &#124;
&#124; Website &#124; The associated website . &#124;

title : Announce dynamic changes with live regions in canvas apps &#124; Microsoft Docs
# Announce dynamic changes with live regions for canvas apps
You can solve this problem by adding live regions , which screen readers track . If content changes in a live region , a screen reader will announce that change .
# # Example uses of live regions
You can use live regions to notify users when events such as these occur :
* A validation error occurs in a form .
* A background timer refreshes a news feed .
# # Create and configure a live region
# Visualize hierarchical data with model-driven apps
# # Important things to remember
- A hierarchy or visualization is based on one entity only . You can depict the account hierarchy showing accounts at multiple levels , but you can ’ t show accounts and contacts in the same hierarchy visualization .
To enable visualizations for a hierarchy you must connect the hierarchy to a quick view form . This can only be done using solution explorer .
The hierarchy settings are associated to an entity in the solution explorer .
&gt; If the hierarchy settings do not exist the entity is not eligible to have a hierarchy configured .
&gt; There can be only one hierarchy setting
1 . Set the data in the following fields :
# # Visualization walk through
&gt; The hierarchy icons don ’ t appear in the record grid view until the records are related using the hierarchical relationship .
title : &quot; Map entity fields in Power Apps &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
You can map attributes between entities that have an entity relationship . This lets you set default values for a record that is created in the context of another record .
# # Easier way to create new records in model-driven apps
# # # The easier way
The new contact record form will include any of the mapped attribute values from the account ( such as address and phone information ) as the default values . People can edit these values before they save the record .
When you map entity fields for a 1 : N entity relationship certain items of data from the primary entity record will be copied into the new related entity form to set default values that people can edit before saving .
The only way to map entity fields is to use solution explorer .
The following rules show what kinds of data can be mapped .
- Both fields must be of the same type and the same format .
- The length of the target field must be equal to or greater than the length of the source field .
- The target field can ’ t be mapped to another field already .
- The source field must be visible on the form .
- The target field must be a field that a user can enter data into .
- Address ID values can ’ t be mapped .
- If you map to or from a field that isn ’ t displayed on a form , the mapping won &apos;t be done until the field is added to a form .
- If the fields are option sets , the integer values for each option should be identical .
# # Automatically generate field mappings
You should use care when doing this with system entities . Use this when you create custom entities and want to leverage mapping .
Because field mappings are not metadata , you must publish them before changes take effect .

Specifies a value with an integer data type that may be passed as a parameter .
# # Open entity data in Excel
The Excel Add-in automatically reads the data for the entity that you selected . Note that there will be no data in the workbook until the Excel Add-in reads it in .
# # View and refresh data in Excel
# # Edit data in Excel
You can change entity data as you require and then publish it back by selecting * * Publish * * in the Excel Add-in .
To edit a record , select a cell in the worksheet , and then change the cell value .
To add a new record , follow one of these steps :
* Select in the last row of the worksheet , and then press the Tab key until the cursor moves out of the last column of that row , and a new row is created .
You can use the designer to adjust the columns and entities that are automatically added to the worksheet .
&gt; - Make sure to always include the ID and required fields in your workbook , as you may receive errors when publishing .
&gt; - When adding look up fields , make sure to add both the ID and the Display fields .
* Look up fields must be edited using the add-in to ensure the correct record is referenced , updating these fields via copy and past or typing directly into the field is not supported .

title : Understand record references and polymorphic lookups &#124; Microsoft Docs
# Understand record references and polymorphic lookups in canvas apps
In the next section , you &apos;ll start to explore these concepts by working with the * * Owner * * lookup .
# # Show the fields of a record owner
To show that field in the * * Account * * entity :
With these data sources in place , use this formula to display the name of either a user or a team :
Then replace the previous formula with this one :
# # Filter based on an owner
Congratulations — you &apos;ve finished the hardest aspect of working with a record reference . Other use cases are more straightforward because they don &apos;t access fields of the record . As a case in point , take filtering , which you &apos;ll explore in this section .
You can get a little fancier by supporting filtering by either a user or a team .
The app will display only one combo box at a time , depending on the state of the radio control . Because they &apos;re directly above one another , they &apos;ll appear to be the same control that changes its contents .
With these changes , you can show all records or filter them based on either a user or a team :
# # Update the owner by using Patch
To add this capability to the app :
1 . Move the copied controls to the right of the gallery .
# # Show the owner by using a form
The new card appears at the bottom of the form control .
1 . Resize the card as needed to show all the text .
# # Show the fields of a customer
What does it all mean ?
- Activity tasks and activities have a one-to-many relationship . You can easily ask for all faxes that relate to an account .
To explore this concept in the app :
1 . Add another screen .
This step returns the filtered list of faxes for a given account .
As you select an item in the list of accounts , the list of faxes shows faxes for only that account .
You can show all activities by changing only one line in the previous example . Replace `Gallery2.Selected.Faxes` with `Gallery2.Selected.Activities` .
By using this formula , you can show the record type in a label control within the gallery :
When you create an entity , you can enable attachments .
As of this writing , canvas apps don &apos;t support activity parties .

* A configuration error occurred while rendering your report . *
This can happen due to multiple reasons such as :
Additional differences between Power Apps portals with capacity-based licenses and add-on based licenses :
- Provisioning method is different for portals with capacity-based licenses from add-on based licenses .
You can create Power Apps portal with capacity-based license using steps described in following articles :
# # # When is an add-on portal in suspended state ?
You can configure a portal to redirect a user to a default page after signing in . To achieve this functionality , you can include a JavaScript code in the Home web template .
For example , if you want to redirect all users to the Forums page after signing in , you can include a JavaScript code in the Home web template as follows :
# # # I &apos;m getting an error that only one portal can be created .
# # # I &apos;m getting an error that I can &apos;t delete my portal .
If you don &apos;t have sufficient privileges to delete a portal , you &apos;ll see an error as follows :
If you don &apos;t have sufficient privileges to create a portal in an environment , you &apos;ll see an error as follows :
Sometimes the database creation can take time and the correct status might not reflect on the home page . In this case , you &apos;ll see the following message :
# # # I &apos;m getting an error that portal creation is blocked in this tenant by global administrator
If portal creation is blocked in a tenant by your global administrator , you &apos;ll see an error as follows :
Contact your global administrator to enable creation of portals by non-administrators also .
# # # I &apos;m getting an error that I don &apos;t have appropriate license to access this website .
After you &apos;ve provisioned a portal , the option to change the portal audience is disabled .
&gt; - The changing of Dynamics 365 instance is applicable only to the portals provisioned using the older portal add-ons .
Deleting a portal completely requires deleting the Portal website host and as uninstalling Portal solutions from your Common Data Service environment .
# # Common Data Service environment lifecycle
To associate your portal again to relevant organizations :
- If the organization ID is the same after the restore operation , and portal solutions are also available :
Your portal will be restarted and a connection will be created with the organization again .
- If the organization ID is different after the restore operation , or portal solutions are deleted from your organization :
3 . Follow the instructions in the wizard .
Your portal will be restarted and start working again .
When you enable diagnostic logging , you can search for particular errors that users report by using the Activity ID shown on the generic error page . The Activity ID is logged along with the error details and is useful to find the actual issue .
# # Portal administration and management
# # # How do I get new portal releases in my sandbox portal first before it gets applied to production ?
Below is a list of most common causes and their corresponding mitigation steps :
Once this action is successfully executed , your Common Data Service environment URL will be updated and portal will start working .
This issue occurs when the Common Data Service environment is put in administration mode either when changing organization from production to sandbox mode or manually by an organization administrator .
If restarting the portal doesn &apos;t work and this issue is occurring for a long period of time , contact Microsoft support for help .
# # # # Website binding not found
This issue occurs when the website binding records for portal are deleted from the underlying Common Data Service environment and portal isn &apos;t able to create binding automatically . To fix this issue :
4 . After you delete all website binding records , restart the portal .
Once you complete the above steps , your portal will restart and will recreate website binding record automatically .
2 . Create a website binding record manually with following values :
- Leave all other fields blank .
3 . Once website binding record is recreated , restart your portal from Power Apps Portals admin center .
If portal reset and reprovision doesn &apos;t solve this issue , contact Microsoft support for help .
However , if you &apos;re seeing stale data for a long time in non-portal metadata entities , it can be because of variety of issues listed below :
# # # # Entities not enabled for cache invalidation
# # # # Organization not enabled for change tracking
Portal checker ( self-service diagnostic ) tool will also point out these issues by looking at your portal configuration .
# # # # Web page tracking enabled
The portal checker tool will list all the web pages ( both root and content page ) which are enabled for page tracking . These pages should be disabled by following these steps :
2 . Go to Advanced find .
# # # # Web file tracking enabled
The portal checker tool will list all the web files that are enabled for page tracking . These files should be disabled by following these steps :
# # # # Login tracking enabled
The portal checker tool will check if login tracking is enabled for your portal and will show a failed check if it &apos;s enabled . Login tracking should be disabled by following these steps :
5 . Restart the portal .
# # # # Header output cache is disabled
The portal checker tool will check if header output cache is disabled on your portal and will show a failed check if it &apos;s disabled . To enable it :
# # # # Footer output cache is disabled
# # # # Large number of web file records
- Use an external file server like Azure blob storage or CDN to store these files and then reference these files on the appropriate pages either within the page or in underlying template .
1 . Create a dummy web page with no content and a blank template . This page would be used to create a direct path to your web files .
3 . Reference your web file directly in the HTML of the page template or web template of the page where you want to use it . This will load your file on demand on that page .
To avoid this , you can do the following steps :
1 . If a web file isn &apos;t needed on the home page , make sure its parent page isn &apos;t set as home page and reuse the mechanism described above to load it on demand .
# # # # Entity form lookup configuration
# # # # Number of web roles
3 . Create a new site marker with following values :
# # # The Home site marker isn &apos;t pointing to any webpage
# # # The Home site marker is pointing to a deactivated web page
# # # The Home site marker isn &apos;t pointing to home page of the portal
# # # The Profile site marker isn &apos;t pointing to any webpage
# # # The Profile site marker is pointing to a deactivated web page
# # # An active Page Not Found site marker isn &apos;t available for this portal
# # # The Page Not Found site marker isn &apos;t pointing to any webpage
# # # The Page Not Found site marker is pointing to a deactivated web page
# # # An active Access Denied site marker isn &apos;t available for this portal
# # # The Access Denied site marker isn &apos;t pointing to any webpage
# # # Profile web form isn &apos;t available for contact entity
# # # Published state isn &apos;t available for this website
# # # Published state isn &apos;t visible
# # # List of entities with search result having invalid URL

# # # List of entities with CMS security check failed
To fix this issue , ensure that your entity has proper search page .
# # # Web file isn &apos;t active
To fix this issue , ensure that the web file is in active state .
# # # The partial URL of web file is misconfigured
To fix this issue , ensure that the partial URL is the file name with Home as the root page .
# # # Web file doesn &apos;t have a file attachment

# Assign model-driven app form order
You can &apos;t assign security roles to quick create , quick view , or card forms , so the only form that will be used by everyone is the one at the top of the form order .
# # Delete a custom entity
# # Delete an entity that has dependencies
You can ’ t delete an entity while it has a dependency on another component , such as a business process flow or a model-driven app .
There are two ways that you can remove a dependency :
- Reconfigure the component to remove the dependency .
- Delete the component .

# Timer control in Power Apps
A control that can determine how your app responds after a certain amount of time passes .
Timers can , for example , determine how long a control appears or change other properties of a control after a certain amount of time has passed .
&gt; In Power Apps Studio , timers run only in Preview mode .
# # # Show a countdown
The label shows how many seconds remain before the timer restarts .
# # # Animate a control
Any of these strategies is sufficient :
* Allow users to cancel the timed event .
* Allow users to adjust the time limit before it begins .
* Warn 20 seconds before the time limit expires and provide an easy way to extend the limit .
&gt; If the timer is visible and running , screen readers will announce the elapsed time every five seconds .

title : &quot; Define calculated fields in Power Apps &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# Define calculated fields to automate manual calculations
Use calculated fields to automate manual calculations used in your business processes .
- Calculated fields use the fields from the current entity or related parent entities .
- You can configure calculated fields to use custom controls .
# # Create a calculated field
- Option Set
- Two Options
&gt; Note that field level security will be ignored on the related entity , so if there is sensitive data in the accessed field we suggest securing your calculated field as well .
Let ’ s take a look at calculated field examples in more detail .
# # # Weighted revenue of opportunity
# # # # Set the condition on the opportunities :
# # # Follow-up date of opportunity
In this example , we are using the fields of the originated lead of an opportunity to calculate the appropriate date when to follow up on the opportunity .
In the calculated field definition editor , in the * * Condition * * section , we specify two conditions the purchase time frame and the estimated value of the lead .
In the * * ACTION * * , we provide two formulas :
- To follow up in one week on the immediate opportunity
- To follow up in one month if the opportunity is not likely to happen right away .
The following screenshots show step-by-step how to define the * * Follow-up date * * calculated field .
# # # # Set the two conditions on the originating lead :
# # # # Provide the formula to follow up in one week :
# # # # Provide the formula to follow up in one month :
# # # Days from a record creation
# # # # Provide the formula for computing the difference in days
&gt; The function names are specified in uppercase letters .
You should be aware of certain conditions and limitations when working with calculated fields :
- The calculated field values are not displayed in the Outlook Client Offline mode in the tile views or on entity main forms .
- A maximum number of chained calculated fields is 5 .
- A calculated field can ’ t refer to itself or have cyclic chains .
- Sorting is disabled on :
- A calculated field that contains a field of a parent record .
- A calculated field that contains a logical field ( for example , address field )
- A calculated field that contains another calculated field .
- Calculated fields can span two entities only .
- A calculated field can contain a field from another entity ( spanning two entities – current entity and parent record ) .
- A calculated field can ’ t contain a calculated field from another entity that also contains another field from a different entity ( spanning three entities ) :
- You can ’ t trigger workflows or plug-ins on calculated fields .
- Duplicate detection rules are not triggered on calculated fields .
- A rollup can &apos;t reference a calculated field that uses another calculated field , even if all the fields of the other calculated field are on the current entity .

# # Add a data source to use for virtual entities
# # # Add a secured field to a Data Source
&gt; The Data Source Secret attribute is only available with fields added to a Data Source form .
# # Create a virtual entity
You create a virtual entity just like any other entity in Common Data Service with the addition of a few extra attributes described here . Virtual entities must be created using solution explorer .
# # # Open solution explorer
# # # Create a virtual entity
1 . On the Entity Definition , complete the following required fields .
Here &apos;s an example of a virtual entity named * Movie * that uses a Azure Cosmos DB data provider to access document files .
# # Considerations when you use virtual entities
Virtual entities have these restrictions .
- All virtual entities are read-only .
- Virtual entities don &apos;t support custom fields with the Currency , Image , or Customer data types .
- Virtual entities don &apos;t support auditing .
- Virtual entity fields can &apos;t be used in rollups or calculated fields .
- A virtual entity can &apos;t be an activity type of entity .
- Virtual entities that use the included OData v4 data provider are enabled on outbound port 443 .

# # Additional client-side field validation
Sometimes you might need to customize the validation of fields on the form . The following example demonstrates adding a custom validator . This example forces the user to specify an email only if the other field for preferred method of contact is set to Email .
&gt; The client-side field validation is not supported in a subgrid .
# Create accessible canvas apps in Power Apps
- Ensure all elements are clearly visible and text is of sufficient size . All content must be easily read and understood by the naked eye .
- Avoid using the visibility property of items to bring an element into view . If you need to show something conditionally , create the content in a new screen and navigate to it and back .
- Ensure layout follows a logical flow when read top-bottom , left to right .
- Avoid setting tab index higher than zero .

title : &quot; Define rollup fields with Power Apps &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# Define rollup fields that aggregate values
Rollup fields help users obtain insights into data by monitoring key business metrics . A rollup field contains an aggregate value computed over the records related to a specified record . This includes regular entities and activity entities such as emails and appointments .
The benefits and capabilities of rollup fields include the following :
- Visual editing is easy . You can create rollup fields by using the Field Editor , just like you do when you create a regular field .
- Full filter support for aggregation . You can set various filters for the source entity or related entity while setting multiple conditions .
- Rollup fields are solution components . You can easily transport the rollup fields as components between environments and distribute them in solutions .
- Rollup fields and the calculated fields are complementary to each other . You can use a rollup field as a part of the calculated field , and vice versa .
- You can configure rollup fields to use custom controls .
Some examples of rollup fields include :
- Total estimated revenue of open opportunities of an account
- Total estimated revenue of open opportunities across all accounts in a hierarchy
- Total estimated revenue of an opportunity including child opportunities
- Total estimated value of qualified leads generated by a campaign
- Number of high priority open cases across all accounts in a hierarchy
- Earliest created time of all high priority open cases for an account
The rollups are calculated by scheduled system jobs that run asynchronously in the background . You have to be an administrator to view and manage the rollup jobs .
# # # View Rollup jobs
To view rollup jobs :
# # # Mass Calculate Rollup Field
# # # Calculate Rollup Field
There are a few considerations you should keep in mind when using the online recalculation option ( manual refresh on the form ) :
# # Modify rollup job recurrence
On the nav bar , choose * * Actions * * and select the action you want .
In this example , a hierarchy is not used . The total estimated revenue is calculated for an account , from the related open opportunities .
In this example , we calculate the total estimated revenue of an opportunity including the child opportunities , over the hierarchy .
In this example , we calculate the total estimated revenue of open opportunities across all accounts , over the hierarchy .
In this example , we calculate the total time spent and billed from all activities related to an account . This may include time spent on the phone , at appointments , or on custom activities .
In this example , we calculate an average estimated revenue from all opportunities related to an account .
The following example shows how to calculate an average estimated revenue from related opportunities over a hierarchy of accounts . An average estimated revenue can be seen at each level in the hierarchy .
You should be aware of certain conditions and restrictions when working with rollup fields :
- You can define a maximum of 100 rollup fields for the organization and up to 10 rollup fields per entity .
- A workflow can ’ t be triggered by the rollup field updates .
- A workflow wait condition cannot use a rollup field .
- A rollup over the rollup field is not supported .
- The rollup can only apply filters to the source entity or related entities , simple fields or non-complex calculated fields .
- The business rules , workflows or calculated fields always use the last calculated value of the rollup field .
As you can see , the precision rounding to two decimal points on the aggregated field is done before the aggregation is performed .
# # # Different behavior from Associated grids
# Behavior and format of the date and time field

# Use Cognitive Services in Power Apps
# # Introduction to Azure Cognitive Services
# # # Try out the Text Analytics API
The API has an online demo – you can see how it works , and look at the JSON that the service returns .
The API is available as a free preview , and it is associated with an Azure subscription . You manage the API through the Azure portal .
8 . Copy one of the keys on the right of the screen . You use this key later when you create a connection to the API .
# # # Create the app and add a connection
# # # Add controls to the app
Follow the steps below to create this screen . If a control name is specified , that name is used in a formula in the next section .
We &apos;re keeping this app simple to focus on calling the Text Analytics API , but you could add things - like logic to show and hide controls based on the check boxes selected , error handling if the user doesn &apos;t select any options , and so on .
# # # Add logic to make the right API calls
There &apos;s a bit going on here , so let &apos;s break it down :
* Within each call , specify the appropriate parameters :
* For each call that is made , add the results to the appropriate collection :
# # # Display the results of the API calls
To display the results of the API calls , reference the appropriate collection in each control :
If you compare the output of this app to the Text Analytics API page at the beginning of this article , you see that the results are the same .

This section helps you understand the Dynamics 365 Portals release process to prepare for any new release properly and to reduce any impact on your customers . It also talks about various components which are part of your portal .
A portal consists of the following components :
# # Impact of new releases on a Portal solution
# # # Portal website host update
# # # Portal solution update
# # Get notified about new releases
Notifications are sent around 2-5 business days ahead of the release . Notifications are sent to only those customers whose portals are planned to be updated . Each notification provides details of the type of update and the date / time it will be rolled out along with the link to release notes .
# # Enable a portal for new release

The formulas for the picture and name are adjusted to use this name for the current record :
Let &apos;s unpack what is happening here :
# # Self and Parent operators
There are three ways to refer to a control and its properties within a formula :
Use single quotes around a name that contains a space or other special character .
Use two single quotes together to represent one single quote in the name . Names that do not contain special characters do not require single quotes .
Here are some example column names you might encounter in a table , and how they are represented in a formula :
&#124; Column name in a database &#124; Column reference in a formula &#124;
# # Display names and logical names
Since display names are easier to understand , Canvas apps will suggest them as choices and not suggest logical names . Although logical names are not suggested , they can still be used if typed indirectly .

title : Develop offline-capable canvas apps &#124; Microsoft Docs
Mobile users often need to be productive even when they have limited or no connectivity . When you build a canvas app , you can perform these tasks :
The functions also don &apos;t automatically resolve merge conflicts when a device comes online . Configuration on what data is saved and how to handle reconnection is up to the maker when writing expressions .
# # # Handling offline data
# # Build an offline app
At a high level , the app performs these tasks :
- When the user opens the app :
- Every five minutes while the app is online :
- The app posts any tweets in the local cache .
This formula checks whether the device is online :
# # # Step 4 : Show connection status
This formula determines whether the device is online :
- If the device is online , it posts the tweet immediately .
Then the formula resets the text in the text-input box .
1 . Open the app on a mobile device that &apos;s connected to the Internet .
1 . Disconnect the device from the Internet by enabling the device &apos;s airplane mode and disabling wi-fi .
1 . Reconnect the device to the Internet by disabling the device &apos;s airplane mode and enabling wi-fi .

- An active case can be canceled at any time .
- A resolved or canceled case cannot be reactivated .
# Understand data cards in Power Apps
In this example , a single-line text card is selected , but the URL &apos;s text is longer than can be shown on a single line . Let &apos;s change this to a multi-line text card to give our users more room to edit :
Let &apos;s walk through an example of how to change a card &apos;s appearance by manipulating controls in it .
3 . Move this control within the card by dragging the selection box , and resize the control by dragging the handles along the edge of the selection box :
You can resize , move , and make other modifications to controls within a card , but you can &apos;t delete it without unlocking it first .
Click or tap the banner at the top to unlock the card so that you can modify these properties :
&gt; You can &apos;t relock a card if you unlock it . To get a card back to a locked state , remove it , and reinsert it in the right-hand pane .
The star is now a part of the card and will travel with it if , for example , you reorder the cards within the form .
# # Interact with a form
After you unlock a card , you can change how it interacts with the form that contains it .
# # # Information flowing in
# # # Information flowing out
Let &apos;s look at the controls that make up a basic data-entry card . The space between controls has been increased to show each more clearly :
In this graphic , the controls within the data card have been labeled :
Four controls make this card work :

title : Understand experimental , preview , and experimental features &#124; Microsoft Docs
With every release , we make changes and add features to make Power Apps the best tool to fit your needs . We move the product forward .
We take backward compatibility very seriously . However , with any change or improvement , we might introduce an unintended side effect , and your app might not work exactly the way it did before .
Features move through three stages on their way to becoming official parts of the product :
At each stage , the number of people who use the feature increases , helping us to validate that the feature is what you need and that we &apos;re not introducing unintended side effects .
This table may help you decide when you should jump in :
Where can you find information about these features ? We treat Preview features as finished features , and you can learn more about them just as you do any other product features :
# # Controlling which features are enabled
In some cases , you might need to close and reopen the app after you change a setting . The feature description should indicate when you must perform this step .
Sometimes a feature needs to be retired . Often this occurs when there is a new , better way to accomplish a task . Unpopular features are also pruned too as all features require some overhead to keep up with product changes around them .
Feature deprecation also goes through stages . Features are unique and not every stage will be used by all features .
# Create a Common Data Service starter portal
These are some benefits of creating a portal :
- You can design the portal through the WYSIWYG Power Apps portals Studio by adding and configuring components on the webpages .
You can create a portal either in a new environment or in your existing environment .
If you choose to create your portal in an existing environment without portal pre-requisites , the pre-requisites are installed first and then the portal is created . In this method , the portal provisioning can take some time and you ’ ll be notified when the portal is provisioned .
To create a portal :
If you have created your portal in the environment that doesn &apos;t have portal pre-requisites installed , the provisioning status is also displayed in the grid :
After the portal is provisioned successfully , the status is updated and the portal is displayed in the grid :
&gt; - Power Apps portals is not available in the France region .
In this scenario , the following table explains which additional portal template and language combination is allowed when creating additional portals :
The following notification is displayed when you select * * Create * * to provision the portal .
* * Notifications in the Notifications pane * *
Notification shown for provisioning in progress
Notification shown for provisioning successfully completed
If the portal provisioning fails , the notifications are displayed similarly .
# # Disable portal creation in a tenant

# Import or export data from Common Data Service
There are two ways that you can import files into entities from Excel or CSV files .
1 . Prepare the file template .
c . Refer to the next section for instructions to make sure data is unique before you import it into an entity .
1 . Modify the file with your data .
- Copy data from your Excel or CSV file into the template that you just created .
b . Select the entity that you want to import data into .
f . Choose your file . Follow the prompts to upload your file .
h . After the import finishes successfully , you &apos;ll see the total number of inserts and updates .
# # Option 2 : Import by bringing your own source file
# # Ensure uniqueness when you import data into an entity from Excel or CSV
Users can still use primary keys as identifiers after they specify alternate keys . In the preceding sample , the first file is still valid if GUIDs are valid data .
# # Export data to CSV
The following data types aren &apos;t currently supported .

# Manage existing portals in Power Apps
Opens the portal to browse the website . This helps you to see the portal as it will look to your customers .
# # # Share with internal users
To share the portal with internal users you must first create a security role and then assign users to the security role so they can use the portal .
4 . Set the privileges for all the entities used in your portal .
2 . Select the user that you want to assign a security role to .
# # # Share with external users
You must delete the portal configurations manually to completely remove portal configurations from your environment . To do this , use the Portal Management app , and delete the corresponding website record for the portal .
Displays details such as owner of the portal , date and time when it was created and last modified , and the URL of the portal .
# Create web roles for portals
To create a web role :
4 . Enter appropriate values in the fields .
The table below explains the Web Role attributes used by portals .
&#124; Website &#124; The associated website &#124;
&#124; Description &#124; An explanation of the Web Role &apos;s purpose . Optional . &#124;
Now that the Web Role has been created , you will be able to configure it to meet your needs via various permissions , rules , and associations .
&gt; If the commands are not available , the entity is not eligible to create a custom relationship .
The following fields must be set in order to save the entity relationship :
&#124; Required Field &#124; Description &#124;
# # # Entity relationship properties
These properties are about the relationship .
# # # Navigation Pane Item for Primary Entity
From the primary entity you can navigate to see related records . This data is used by model-driven apps to control how the related entity records are displayed . These settings can also be edited using the form editor .
This where you can define standard behaviors for related entities . This information is important because it helps ensure data integrity and can automate business processes for your company .
Let ’ s look at an example .
- Reassign all active tasks .
- Reassign all tasks .
- Reassign none of the tasks .
- Reassign all tasks currently assigned to the former owner of the opportunity .
The relationship can control how actions performed on a record for the primary entity record cascade down to any related entity records .
There are several kinds of behaviors that can be applied when certain actions occur .
These are the behaviors available to be configured .
# # # # Type of Behavior options
Use the * * Type of Behavior * * field to choose between a set of standard behaviors or whether you want to configure them independently .
&#124; Action &#124; Parental &#124; Not Parental &#124;
Usually this means that for each entity pair there is only one parental relationship . There are some cases where the lookup on the related entity may allow for a relationship to more than one type of entity .
Any activity entity has a similar set of parental entity relationships for entities that can be associated using the regarding lookup field .
# # # Limitations on behaviors you can set
Because of parental relationships there are some limitations you should keep in mind when you define entity relationships .
# Image properties in Power Apps

# Overview of the calendar-screen template for canvas apps
This overview teaches you :
&gt; * How to use the default calendar screen .
&gt; * How to modify it .
&gt; * How to integrate it into an app .
To add a calendar screen from the template :
By default , the screen looks similar to this :
1 . To show data , select an option in the drop-down list near the top of the screen .
* Today &apos;s date is selected by default , and you can easily return to it by selecting the calendar icon in the upper-right corner .
* If at least one event is scheduled for a particular date , a small colored circle appears under that date in the calendar .
* If you select a date for which one or more events are scheduled , the event ( s ) appear in a list under the calendar .
You can modify the default functionality of this screen in a few common ways :
# # # Specify the calendar
1 . Delete these controls :
1 . If the calendar screen isn &apos;t the default screen , add a button that navigates from the default screen to the calendar screen so that you can test the app .
IntelliSense lists the fields that you can select .
1 . Select the field that you want .
The label shows the type of information that you specified .
# # Integrate the screen into an app

title : &quot; Model-driven app main form presentations in Power Apps &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# How model-driven app main forms appear on different devices
This diagram represents common components found in updated entity forms .
For updated entities , the layout of the form works with a wide range of displays and window sizes . As the width of window decreases , tab columns move down so that you can scroll down to work with them instead of being compressed or requiring you to scroll to the right .
The following table summarizes available components of the main form for updated entities .
# # Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets forms
# # # View port element
The following items are always visible within the view port in the context of a form :
People can tap the search control to open the screen to search for records .
The form elements displayed are taken from the main form and presented as a series of panels that users see through the view port .
You can show additional tiles based on entity relationships , but you can ’ t customize the tiles for the following entities :
You can customize the remaining tiles with the form editor . The order is fixed , but you can set which elements are visible in the relationship panel .
The remaining panels of the form contain the contents of the tabs in the form . Any subgrids found display as a separate panel .
&gt; To optimize performance on mobile devices , the number of objects is limited to 5 tabs or 75 fields and 10 subgrids .
In addition , entity images are visible in list views and contact cards , but not within the actual form .
Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets supports multiple forms but doesn &apos;t provide a way for people to switch between forms if they can access more than one . People will see the first form in the form order that they have access to .
&#124; Form Order &#124; Form Name &#124; Security roles &#124;
The following diagram shows the main form components used in the classic presentation .
The forms for updated entities have inherited many components from the classic forms , but there are significant differences .
The form assistant is exposed for certain entities , such as `Article` .

title : &quot; Create custom help pages &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# Create guided help for your Unified Interface app
# # Custom help panes and learning path
The new guided help implementation of custom help panes differs from the previous learning path guided help feature . Both features let you create custom help for your application . However , custom help panes are optimized for the most common guided help scenarios .
Custom help panes provide the following key features that are not available with learning path :
- Free-form rich text , including bullets and numbering .
- Visibly linked coach marks and help balloons .
- More options for video sources , including private sources .
- Storage of help content in Common Data Service as part of your solution .
Custom help panes don &apos;t provide the following key features that are available with learning path :
- Sequential help balloons .
- Help pages per role .
- Help pages for per-device form factor , such as smartphones .
To author custom help panes , you need the following :
# # Enable custom help panes for your environment
Each help pane is unique for these contexts :
By default , a help pane stays open and on the help content you first opened it with even when you navigate to a different form . This allows for the help content to remain intact as you direct users to different parts of the app .
# # # To author help pane content
The help pane is now in edit mode and the cursor is positioned on the help pane title .
3 . From the edit pane you can perform the following tasks :
- Enter text by typing directly in the help pane area .
Selecting the bullet or number icon toggles the current line to become bulleted or numbered . If you have selected multiple lines in a list , each line becomes bulleted or numbered . Tabbing and indenting subnumbers a line within the list .
A section is a collapsible text box . You can put links or free-form text in it . Use a section to group similar items . A section can be either open or collapsed by default .
# # # Video and static images
&gt; Remember to copy the link URL for the video or image you want so you can paste it into your help pane .
Custom help panes support the following video sources :
# # # Balloons and coach marks
1 . Link to first UI element with instructions or comments .
2 . Link to second UI element with instructions or comments .
3 . Link to third UI element with instructions or comments .
A user can either select an element in order or go back to a specific one and highlight it .
# # Solutions and custom help pane content
# # # Moving content via solutions
1 . Navigate to your unmanaged solution .
&gt; Currently , you can &apos;t add existing help panes to an unmanaged solution in the modern solution explorer .
When exported , each help page is exported as a separate file .
This section discusses frequently asked questions about custom help pages .
# # # Are custom help pages the same as customizable help ?
# # # How do I migrate my data from learning path to custom help pages ?
Learning path has two types of help : help panes and sequential help balloons . The sequential help balloon locations are deeply integrated with the legacy web client UI and are not transferrable to the new custom help panes .

2 . Open the form that contains the sub-grid .
# # Data types that aren &apos;t editable in an editable grid
# # Group by views work on client side only
# # Business rules work only if conditional field is a column on the grid
Business Rules on an editable grid are supported only if the conditional field is also a column on the grid . If the field is not a column the business rules won ’ t work . Verify that each field referenced in the business rule is also included on the form . Note that business rules on an editable grid do not fire if the editable grid is configured on a dashboard .

title : &quot; Global search in Power Apps portals &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
In Power Apps portals , you can search for records across multiple entities by using portal &apos;s global search functionality . You can also search within records of entity lists using entity list search functionality .
Entity list search functionality in the portal uses FetchXML in the backend to search the columns defined in the entity list and then display the results .
Global search uses an external search index that is based on Lucene.Net and is used to search within multiple entities and fields at once .
Global search of portals allows you to search for records across multiple entities . It also allows you to search across multiple columns and configure what columns of an entity would be searchable .
Among the benefits of global search are its ability to :
- Return results from all searchable entities in a single list sorted by relevance , based on factors such as :
- Number of words matched .
- Proximity to each other in the text .
- Highlight matches in the search results .
- Provide facet options that can be used to further filter search results .
The following sections detail how global search works in Power Apps portals and describe the various configuration options available .
# # Entities searchable in portal global search
- Articles are searchable only if they are published and their Internal Only field is set to false .
- Idea Comment
If the view is not available for any entity , it &apos;s not indexed and the results are not displayed in global search .
The following site settings are related to global search :
The following content snippets are related to global search :
# # Special characters and syntax supported by search
As part of portal global search , a variety of special characters and syntaxes are supported to filter search results better . These special characters and syntaxes are broadly divided into the following groups :
Each search query can consist of one or many of these terms of any type that are combined using Boolean operators to create complex queries .
&gt; Boolean operators must be written in uppercase .
# # Liquid search tag
Search index updates in Power Apps portals happen automatically like the cache invalidation . Keep these important things in mind , though :
# # Rebuild full search index
Rebuild of full search index is required whenever :
- You make a metadata change to search properties like changing certain query-specific site settings or changing the search view of an entity , and so on .
- Bulk data migration or updates are performed .
You can also rebuild a full search index from a portal .
&gt; A full index rebuild is a very expensive operation and should not be done during peak hours of usage , as this can bring your portal down .
# # Remove an entity from global search
At times , you might be required to completely remove certain entities from portal global search to ensure that your customers get the right results quickly .
In the following example , we will remove the Case entity from portal global search .
1 . Save and publish the changes and close the view editor .
&gt; In this example , we are making changes in an unmanaged layer by directly editing the view . You can also do this via a managed solution .
# # # Step 2 : Remove case entity from the UI
The modified value will be :
Once this site setting is changed , the Case entity will be removed from filters on the search page as well as in the header .

# Using the tree view in the form designer
You can also use the tree view to select fields and components present on the form . The tree view is helpful when you want to select hidden elements that are not visible on the form preview .
1 . Open the form designer to create or edit a form .
# Relate and Unrelate functions in Power Apps
Relate and unrelate records of two entities through a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship .
These functions never create or delete a record . They only relate or unrelate two records that already exist .
&#124; Relationship display name &#124; Related entity &#124; Relationship type &#124;
To remove the relationship between these records :
At no time did we create or remove or a record , only the relationship between records was modified .
As Many-to-Many relationships are symmetric , we could also have done this in the opposite direction :
You &apos;ll first create a simple app to view and reassign the reservations that are associated with a product .
The Products entity is part of the sample data loaded above .
1 . Press F5 to test the app in Preview mode .
A delegation warning appears , but it won &apos;t matter with the small amount of data in this example .
The sample data doesn &apos;t include a many-to-many relationship , but you &apos;ll create one between the Products entity and the Contacts entity . Users can relate each product to more than one contact and each contact to more than one product .
1 . Change the entity filter to include all entities .
By default , sample entities don &apos;t appear .
# # # # Relate and unrelate contacts with one or more products
No text will appear in that control until you finish this procedure and assign a contact to a product .
With this app , users can now freely relate and unrelate a set of contacts to each product .
Unlike one-to-many , a many-to-many relationship allows users to associate the same contact with multiple products .
Many-to-many relationships are symmetric . You can extend the example to add products to a contact and then flip between the two screens to show how the relationship appears from either direction .
The result will look very similar to the previous screen but comes at the relationship from the * * Contacts * * side .
With this new screen , users can add a contact to a product and then flip to a view of contacts and see the associated product . The relationships are symmetric and shared between the two screens .

Let &apos;s say you want to add an embedded canvas app on an account main form and pass a list of contacts related to the current account record to the embedded canvas app . To do this , follow these steps :
9 . In the section below the controls list , see the list of properties corresponding to the Canvas app control and note the following :
- Notice that any change to the App ID value breaks the link from the model-driven form to the embedded canvas app .
- The form editor has been listening for the App ID to be sent to it .
- The App ID was sent to it when the app was saved .
Assertion messages , for both passed and failed assertions , are also contained in a Traces table in the TestCaseResult record .

title : &quot; Create or edit model-driven app quick view forms in Power Apps &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# Create a model-driven app quick view form to view information about a related entity
In this topic you learn how to create a quick view form and how to add a quick view control to a main form .
A quick view form can be added to another form as a quick view control . It provides a template to view information about a related entity record within a form for another entity record . This means your app users do not need to navigate to a different record to see the information needed to do their work .
Because quick view forms are viewed using a quick view control in a form , they do not include header , footer , or navigation areas . Security roles cannot be assigned to quick view forms and they cannot be activated or deactivated .
# # Create a quick view form
You create quick view forms using the form editor in a manner similar to the way you create other forms . Quick view forms are read-only . Use them to create forms that are for reading purposes only .
# # Edit a quick view form
When you edit a quick view form , you must publish your changes before they will be visible in the application .
# # Add a quick view control to a main form
Quick view forms can only be added to a main form where a lookup field exists that targets the entity of the quick view form .
# Define web form steps for portals
The Web Form Step provides the flow logic of the form &apos;s user experience such as steps and conditional branching . It also provided details regarding the rendering of a form and additional behavior .
&#124; Name &#124; A title used for reference . &#124;
&#124; Web Form &#124; The Web Form associated with the current step . &#124;
&#124; Target Entity Logical Name &#124; The logical name of the entity associated with the form . &#124;
# Maintenance mode for a portal
There might be times when your website is under scheduled maintenance or is down due to temporary outage . When a customer accesses the website during maintenance , unpredictable behavior and intermittent unavailability might be experienced .
# # Configure or disable maintenance mode
After enabling maintenance mode for your portal , you can update the maintenance mode settings and choose a different page .
You can also choose to disable maintenance mode on your portal when the scheduled maintenance of your website is complete . Your portal users can now browse and access all web pages as usual .
# Build global support into canvas apps
Power Apps is a global product . You can build and use canvas apps in many different languages and regions .
When using the web experiences , the language used is provided by the browser . Most browser default to the host operating system &apos;s setting with some also providing a way to set the language manually .
# # # Names in formulas
Most elements in formula are always in English :
As the authoring experience is localized , control and other object names will appear in the native language of the author . In Spanish , some of the control names appear as :
You can use whatever names you like for :
* Control names
* Collection names
# # # Formula separators and chaining operator
The change in the Power Apps list separator is consistent with what happens to the Excel list separator . It impacts :
* Arguments in function calls .
For example , consider the following formula expressed in a language and region that uses dot or period as the decimal separator , such as Japan or the United Kingdom :
Now view this same formula in a language and region where a comma is used for the decimal separator , such as France or Spain :
The app you create can adapt to different languages , providing a great user experience for your users around the world .
And then use a formula such as the following to pull translated strings from the table :
# # # Formatting numbers , dates , and times
# # # Reading numbers , dates , and times
There are four functions for reading numbers , dates , and times provided by the user :
All of these functions have the same arguments :
# # # Calendar and Clock information
title : &quot; Preview : Use environment variables in solutions &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# Preview : Environment variables overview
Benefits of using environment variables :
- No need to manually edit configurable values in a production environment .
- Configure one or more variables in one place and reference like a parameter across multiple solution components .
- Update values without a code change .
- Service the definitions and the values independently or together .
- Can be used to control feature flags and other application settings .
# # How do they work ?
# # # Create an environment variable in Power Apps
Separation of default value and current value allows you to service the definition and the default value separately from the current value . It also allows us to extend the functionality in the future to support multiple values scoped to a specific run time context .
&gt; A value can &apos;t exist without a definition . The interface only allows creation of one value per definition .
A notification is displayed when the environment variables do not have any values . This is a reminder to set the values so that components dependent on variables do not fail . It also allows partners to ship variables without values and the customer is prompted to input the values .
&gt; We recommend partners build their own interfaces requiring the customers to provide the values . Notifications help prevent failures if this step is skipped .
- Caching . Plugins will need to run a query to fetch the values .
- Data types are validated in the modern solution interface only , but not currently on the server during the preview .
- Dependencies are not enforced for certain component types .
Removes an existing ribbon element from being processed for the ribbon .
# Define web form properties for portals
The web form contains relationships to webpages and a start step to control the initialization of the form within the portal . The relationship to the webpage allows dynamic retrieval of the form definition for a given page node within the website .
The other options on the web form record itself control top-level preferences for the multiple-step process as a whole , for example whether you &apos;d like to display a progress bar .
The following attributes and relationships determine the functionality of the Web form .
&#124; Name &#124; A title of the form used for reference . &#124;
&#124; Prepend Step Number to Step Title &#124; Check to add the number of the step to the beginning of the title of the step . Default is unchecked . &#124;
Example of the various progress indicator types :
* * Title with Step Number prepended * *
&gt; Firefox does not provide the ability to specify a custom message .
# # Geolocation configuration for web form
&gt; The Geolocation section is not visible in the German Sovereign Cloud environment . If a user has enabled geolocation by using a different form , it will not be displayed during rendering on portal .

# How to work with permissions in a lookup list from SharePoint site ?
1 . Create two SharePoint lists with one list consuming columns as lookups from the other list . In this tutorial , we &apos;d use two lists :
&#124; List &#124; Columns
&#124; Colors &#124; - Title ( for color of the shape )
Shapes list has a Color lookup column . This lookup column is connected to the Color column from the Colors list for values . You can also use your own lists instead .
1 . If necessary , create sample items :
&#124; Circle &#124; Red
&#124; Rectangle &#124; Blue
&#124; Triangle &#124; Green
The shape colors are through lookup column from the Colors list .
Since the SharePoint site , list or items aren &apos;t shared with the user , the app will show no available items .
1 . Grant the user item-level permission to a SharePoint list item .
1 . Refresh the app as the user ( Kenny Smith in this example ) .

# Overview of the email-screen template for canvas apps
&gt; * How to use the default email screen .
To add an email screen from the template :
* You must add at least one person as a recipient and provide a subject to send an email .
* After you send the email , the contents of the subject line and message body , as well as the recipient list will all be erased .
This allows users to send a single image with their email as an attachment .
This formula checks for an uploaded image . If there is none , then it uses the same `Office365.SendEmail` operation as before . If there is an image , it is added as an attachment in the Attachments table .
&gt; To add more than one attachment to an email , add records to the Attachments table .

# Create an order gallery in a canvas app
# # Create a blank app
Power Apps Studio opens so that you can add data sources and controls to your app :
The * * Orders * * entity contains many fields of various types :
# # Create the order gallery
The control will be placed on the canvas and a fly out dialog will appear asking which data source to connect to .
# # Show each order &apos;s status
In this procedure , you &apos;ll add space in the gallery for a label and configure it to show each order &apos;s status in a different color based on the data .
With this formula in place , different status values appear in different colors , as the previous graphic shows .
1 . Select the first item in the gallery , which is the gallery &apos;s template :
1 . Move the new label so that it appears under the status label :
1 . Move the gallery to the left edge of the screen , and decrease the gallery &apos;s width to close up some space .

# Choose and configure columns in model-driven app views
Along with the filter criteria , the columns visible in a Power Apps view are very important to the value provided by the view . In this topic , you create or edit views by performing the following tasks :
# # # Open the view editor
You can include columns from the current entity or any of the related entities that have a 1 : N entity relationship with the current entity .
# # # # Add columns to views
2 . Select the fields you want to add to the view designer . This adds the field as a column on the right-hand of the view .
As you add columns , you will increase the width of the view . If the width of the view exceeds the space available to show it in the page , horizontal scrollbars will allow people to scroll and see the hidden columns .
&gt; When you add columns to Lookup views for updated entities , only the first three columns will be displayed .
1 . Select the header of the column you want to remove .

# Deactivate or activate an account or contact
In a model-driven app , you can deactivate an account or contact rather than deleting it . This ensures the integrity of the audit trail associated with that record .
A deactivated account or contact becomes inactive , which means it cannot be edited or used in establishing new relationships with other records . However , all relationships created with the deactivated item are still available .
If later you need to reactivate a deactivated account , it &apos;s easy to do so .

# Transfer data from Hospital to Regional System
Microsoft provides you the following solutions for emergency response :
Hospital Emergency Response solution customers can transfer their hospital data to the regional medical organizations that have Regional Government Emergency Response and Monitoring solution .
This article provides information about how to use SFTP to do the data transfer .
# # How does the data transfer happen ?
These are the prerequisites for the data transfer to work successfully .
# # Configure your solutions for data transfer
IT admins need to perform some steps to configure the data transfer from Hospital Emergency Response solution to SFTP server and from SFTP server to Regional Government Emergency Response and Monitoring solution .
# # # Step 1 : Create connections
This step is required for both hospital and regional solutions .
&gt; Make sure that you create connections in your Power Apps environment before installing the hospital and regional emergency response solutions or upgrading to the latest version . This will save you a lot of steps later while enabling flows that get installed as part of these solutions .
1 . From the top-right corner , select your hospital or regional environment .
This step has to be performed by the admins of the Hospital Emergency Response solution after they have installed the solution .
In this step , we will enable the following flows that will publish reviewed data from the hospital solution to SFTP server on a set schedule and on-demand :
- Publish Bed Census Data
- Publish COVID Data
- Publish Data for All Facilities
- Publish Equipment Needs Data
- Publish Staff Updates
- Publish Supply Item Details
- Update Sync Census
- Update Sync Equipment Needs
To enable these flows :
1 . Specify the data publish recurrence schedule .
# # Review and publish data to SFTP
1 . From the top-right corner , select your hospital environment .
The record &apos;s review status changes to * * Completed * * .
# # # Manually publish data
The scheduled flow publishes data at a certain time , but what if you want to manually or immediately publish the data after reviewing it .
# Reset function in Power Apps
Resets a control to its default value , discarding any user changes .
2 . Type a new value in the text box .
5 . Select the button . This can be done even when authoring by selecting toward the ends of the control .
# Control webpage access for portals
Web page access control rules are rules that you create for your site to control both the publishing actions that a web role can perform across the pages of your website and to control which pages are visible by which web roles . The webpage access entity has the following attributes :
&#124; Name &#124; A descriptive name for the rule . &#124;
&#124; Website &#124; The website that this rule applies to ; must match the website of the page to which this rule is applied . Filters Web Page . &#124;
After creating a new access control rule , associate it with a page . This will cause it to affect both the page you assign the rule to and all child pages &amp; mdash ; in other words , the entire branch of the website .
There are two types of access control rules : Grant Change and Restrict Read .
You would then set the right to restrict read and the page to the page at the top of the branch which is to be read only by employees . You would then associate this rule with the employee web role and then assign users to this role .

You can expect that managers and decisions makers will want forms that are optimized to provide quick reference to key data points . They will like to see charts more than lists and they may not perform a lot of data entry .
People who interact directly with customers may need forms tailored to tasks they perform most frequently . They may want forms that allow for the most efficient data entry .
You ’ ll have to balance this with the amount of time you want to spend managing forms . Creating and editing forms is relatively easy , but as you create more forms , you have to manage more forms .

# Overview of creating apps in Power Apps
Let &apos;s learn more about each of these .
Canvas apps give you the flexibility to arrange the user experience and interface the way you want it . Allow your creativity and business sense to guide how you want your apps to look and feel .
You can start to build your app from Microsoft tools where your data lives , such as :
Creating a canvas app is easy ; with Power Apps , you can find or create your app in several ways :
Getting started with model-driven apps is simple , and you can begin with these topics :
Use these topics to quickly get started with portals :
Getting started with Common Data Service is easy . For example , you can start with these items :
title : &quot; Resolve an unresolved email recipient &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# Resolve an unresolved email recipient
If you receive an email that has email addresses that aren &apos;t associated with an entity record , the email addresses are shown in red . You can then individually select the email addresses and associate them with an entity record . You can then send emails to the newly added email addresses .
* * To resolve an unresolved email recipient * *

# Understand data-form layout for canvas apps in Power Apps
Easily create an attractive and efficient form when you build a canvas app in Power Apps . For example , consider this basic form for recording sales orders :
In this tutorial , we &apos;ll walk through the steps to create this form . We &apos;ll also look at some advanced topics , such as dynamic sizing of fields to fill available space .
1 . Create a tablet app from scratch , and add your data source .
Everything discussed in this article also applies to phone layouts , but phone apps often have only one vertical column .
This record will appear in the form that you build by following steps later in this article .
1 . Add a blank screen where you &apos;ll put the form .
The label shows the sales-order number of the record that you selected in the gallery .
3 . ( optional ) Format the label as follows :
The form shows the record that you selected in the gallery , but the default set of fields might not match what you want in your final product .
Your screen should resemble this example :
# # Select a data card
You can also select cards directly on the form . When a card is selected , a black caption appears above it .
# # Arrange cards in columns
The form doesn &apos;t visibly change , but you have more snap points as you drag the left or right grab handle .
5 . Make the first two lines of the delivery address stretch entirely across the form :
All done . We have our desired form , mixing rows with different numbers of columns :
# # Manipulate controls in a card
The delivery address includes several pieces of information that we want to visually group together for the user . Each field will remain in its own data card , but we can manipulate the controls within the card to make them fit better together .
3 . In the same card , move the text input box over the label to reduce the space between the first and second lines of the address .
The height of the card shrinks when its contents take up less space .
The result for the complete third address line :
# # Turning off Snap to columns
After careful positioning , the result has appropriate sizes for each field and even spacing horizontally between fields :
&#124; Behavior &#124; Snap to columns On &#124; Snap to columns Off &#124;
# # Set width and height
# # # Filling spaces : WidthFit
Let &apos;s make the error message a little longer , and again the control and the card grow to accommodate . The row overall grows in height , keeping vertical alignment between the cards :
title : &quot; View the profile card for a contact or user &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# # View a contact &apos;s profile
2 . Select an existing activity or create a new one .
You can view details of the contact inline which includes the contact picture , name , title and account .
# # View a user &apos;s profile
2 . Select an account record .
3 . Hover over the owner field when it has a user record . You can view the details of the user inline .
Profile cards can be seen on contact and user records . You can only view them when they are in a lookup .
# # # Where is information shown in the profile card coming from ?
# # # How can I customize the fields shown on the profile card ?
Currently , the list of fields displayed on the profile card are not open for customization .
title : Create a canvas app from a SharePoint list &#124; Microsoft Docs
# Create a canvas app in Power Apps from a SharePoint list
The app that you create will contain three screens :
- In the browse screen , you can scroll through all items in the list .
- In the details screen , you can show all information about a single item in the list .
- In the edit screen , you can create an item or update information about an existing item .
You can apply the concepts and techniques in this topic to any list in SharePoint . To follow the steps exactly :
# # Create an app from within Power Apps
# # Create an app from within SharePoint Online
Examples of authority URLs are :
Apply portal site settings referencing the above application .
&gt; The Client ID and the authority URL do not contain the same value and should be retrieved separately .
title : &quot; Create or edit model-driven app dashboards &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# Create or edit model-driven app dashboards
# # Create a new standard dashboard
5 . Select one of the component areas and then select the icon for a chart or a list .
You can have up to six components in the dashboard .
# # Edit an existing dashboard
Additional system dashboards tasks you can perform include :
- Remove a list or chart from a dashboard
- Add a list or chart to a dashboard
- Set the default dashboard
- Use security roles to make a dashboard visible to just certain roles
title : &quot; Optimize model-driven app form performance in Power Apps &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
Think about the interaction the user will have with the form and the amount of data that must be displayed within it .
* * Keep the number of fields to a minimum * *
The more fields you have in a form , the more data that needs to be transferred over the Internet or intranet to view each record .
When you have customizations using form scripts make sure that the developer understands these strategies to improve performance .
* * Avoid including unnecessary JavaScript web resource libraries * *
* * Avoid loading all scripts in the Onload event * *
* * Use collapsed tabs to defer loading web resources * *
# # Command bar or ribbon
Keep these recommendations in mind as you edit the command bar or ribbon .
* * Keep the number of controls to a minimum * *
* * Use asynchronous network requests in Custom Rules * *

# Common Data Service and the improved data source experience
# # How do I upgrade ?
Upgrade your app by inspecting the settings of the features and then by following the directions below :
You may also want to enable the * * Explicit Column Selection * * feature :
1 . Wait for the health monitor to finish analyzing your app .
1 . Resolve all formula errors .
* Possible errors and suggestions * :
For any field and entity display name conflict , you may see a formula that expects an entity but resolves to a locally scoped field name .
1 . Remove your existing Common Data Service data source connections .
1 . Add the Common Data Service connection using the new data source selection experience .
# # Converting canvas apps with the Dynamics 365 connector
2 . Remove your existing Dynamics 365 data source connections .
&gt; - You need to meet one of the following requirements to be able to see an environment that you want to add the connection to :
It ’ s possible to have errors as you convert if : you aren &apos;t using Display Names , if you are using GUID strings , or if you are using an option set field .
- If control name conflicts , change the name of the control to be different and unique .
- For any Polymorphic references , refer to the Detailed Examples section below .
# # # # Removing and adding Option set Data cards
# # # # Editing the Option Set Filter expressions to use new syntax
You &apos;ll need to edit this formula . Option set text identifer is no longer used for the value . This expression should be updated to look the following :
# # # # Editing Option Set Patch statements to use new syntax
Following is an example of earlier Patch statement for Option Set :
You &apos;ll need to update your statements to follow this form :
# # # # Option Set disambiguation
# # # # Removing and adding Two Option set Data cards
If you prefer the toggle switch for your boolean field , you can unlock the data card and replace the control in the data card with a toggle instead . You &apos;ll also need to set these properties on the Toggle .
# # # # Refining Two Option Patch statements
For instance , the Owner field in an entity can refer to a record in the Users entity or the Teams entity . The same lookup field in different records could refer to records in different entities .
# # # # # Polymorphic with Filter and Patch
Record references can be used just like a full record :
2 . Use additional functions to make your intent clear .
There are two new functions you can make use of :
- IsType – Checks if a record reference is of a particular entity type .
- AsType – Casts a record reference to a particular entity type .
With these functions , you can write a formula that displays the name of the Owner taken from two differently named fields , based on the entity type of the Owner :
The following example shows that as you select an Account , all the Activities associated with that account will be displayed :
# # # # # Filtering
You can &apos;t read or filter based on the Regarding field . However , the reverse Notes one-to-many relationship is available . To list all the Notes associated to an Account entity , you can use the following formula :
# Card control in Power Apps
* Allows a single card to be used in both edit and view forms , by configuring this property , which is tied to the Form &apos;s behavior by default .
title : &quot; Delete fields in Power Apps &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
If you delete a lookup field , the 1 : N entity relationship for it will automatically be deleted .
# Add geospatial components to your app ( Preview )
You can add a number of geospatial components to your canvas app to support scenarios that involve mapping locations and addresses .
The following prebuilt components can be used for geospatial and mapping scenarios :
# # # Enable the geospatial features for the environment
The geospatial features require additional terms of use that must be reviewed and agreed to .
&gt; You must read and agree to the terms of service before you can use geospatial features . The following are the terms of service :
&gt; Microsoft shares the address and location queries with TomTom ( tm ) . The name of the customer or end user who entered the query is not shared .

Using formulas to build apps has many advantages :
You &apos;ll sometimes need a variable for your app to behave the way you want . But the approach comes with caveats :
* You must manually update the running total . Automatic recalculation won &apos;t do it for you .
# # Use a global variable
How global variables work :
Let &apos;s rebuild our adding machine by using a global variable :
8 . To show all the places where the variable is defined and used , select it .
Power Apps has three types of variables :
# # Create and remove variables
# # Variable lifetime and initial value
All variables are held in memory while the app runs . After the app closes , the values that the variables held are lost .
When the user opens the app , all variables have an initial value of * blank * .
You use the variable &apos;s name to read its value . For example , you can define a variable with this formula :
Let &apos;s look at how our adding machine would be created using a context variable instead of a global variable .
How context variables work :
Let &apos;s rebuild our adding machine by using a context variable :
9 . To show where the context variable is defined and used , select it .
How collections work :
Let &apos;s recreate our adding machine by using a collection :
# Button control in Power Apps
A control that the user can click or tap to interact with the app .
# # # Add a basic formula to a button
6 . ( optional ) Repeat the previous step one or more times .
# # # Configure a button with multiple formulas
Add a formula that clears the * * Text input * * control between entries .
# # # Add another button to reset the total
Add a second button to clear the total between calculations .
# # # Change a button &apos;s appearance
&gt; The color value can be any CSS color definition , either a name or a hex value .

# Create a custom page template to render an RSS feed
title : &quot; Create or edit a model-driven app view in Power Apps &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
With Power Apps apps , use views to define how a list of records for a specific entity is displayed in the application . A view defines :
- The columns to display
- How wide each column should be
- How the list of records should be sorted by default
- What default filters should be applied to restrict which records will appear in the list
A drop-down list of views is frequently displayed in the application so that people have options for different views of entity data .
This topic is about how system administrators and system customizers work with system and public views .
&#124; Quick Find &#124; The default view used when searches are performed using Quick Find . This view also defines which fields are searched when using search capabilities of Quick Find and Lookup views . &#124;
&#124; Advanced Find &#124; The default view used to display results when using Advanced Find . This view also defines the columns used by default when new custom public views or personal views are created without defining a view to use as a template . &#124;
&#124; Associated &#124; The default view that lists the related entities for a record . &#124;

title : &quot; Guidelines on working with embedded canvas apps &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# Guidelines on working with embedded canvas apps
This topic provides guidelines on working with embedded canvas apps as well as helpful tips to troubleshoot any issues you might encounter .
- Embedded canvas apps are only supported with Unified Interface model-driven apps .
- You can have multiple embedded canvas apps added to the form but can only enable one at a time .
- If you try to enable more than one embedded canvas app on a model-driven form you will get a message that reads “ Only one canvas app can be enabled on a form . ”
- When adding an embedded canvas app to a model-driven form always use a required field that is guaranteed to have a value . If your field does not have a value your embedded canvas app will not refresh in response to any change in data on the host model-driven form .
- Publishing a model-driven form does not also publish the embedded canvas app .
- Embedded canvas apps are not displayed when creating a new record since they need a record context to be passed to them .
- The ModelDrivenFormIntegration.Item object is read-only .
- Embedded canvas apps can only be created via the host model-driven form .
- Adding existing canvas apps as embedded on model-driven forms is currently not supported .
- Support to embed an existing canvas app in a model-driven form using App ID will be provided in a future update .
- Adding a canvas app on the sub-grid control is no longer available .
- In the preview release , makers were able to add a canvas app on a sub-grid control . With canvas app embedding on model-driven forms now generally available , adding an embedded canvas app on a model-driven form is streamlined to the field .
# # Enable an embedded canvas app
1 . Select the field that is customized to display as an embedded canvas app .
# # Disable an embedded canvas app
# # Known issues and limitations with embedded canvas apps
- The ModelDrivenFormIntegration control does not provide a value for fields of a related entity .
- To access fields of a related entity makers can use either of the expressions listed here :
- * ItemId * is empty at authoring time but will have a value at runtime .
# iFrame properties for model-driven app main forms
To view IFrame properties , follow these steps .
&gt; Forms are not designed to be displayed within an iFrame .
# # Pass parameters to iFrames
# Add , configure , move , or delete fields on a form
Add , configure , move , or delete fields using the form designer .
# # Add fields to a form
# # # Add fields to a form using drag and drop
5 . Drop the field in the location you want . Note the following :
- Fields can be dropped before or after any existing field or component .
- Fields can also be dropped in the empty area within a section . In this case the field will be added in an available space so as to evenly distribute fields and components across the section columns .
- Hovering over a tab header when dragging a field changes the currently selected tab , allowing you to add the field to a different tab .
6 . Repeat steps 3-5 above if you want to add more fields .
# # # Add fields to a form using selection
2 . In the form preview , select another existing field or section . Note the following :
- When you select an existing field , the new field is added after the existing field .
- When you select a section , the new field is added in an available space so as to evenly distribute fields across the section columns .
6 . Repeat steps 2-5 above if you want to add more fields .
# # Configure fields on a form
These are the properties available to configure a field when you create or edite a form using the form designer .
You can move a field on a form using drag and drop or cut and paste actions .
# # # Move fields on a form using drag and drop
3 . Repeat step 2 above if you want to move more fields .
# # # Move fields on a form using cut and paste
2 . In the form preview , select the field that you want to move .
6 . Repeat steps 2-5 above if you want to move more fields .
# # Delete fields on a form
2 . In the form preview , select the field that you want to delete from the form .
4 . Repeat steps 2-3 if you want to delete more fields .
&gt; - You can &apos;t delete a field that is locked or is required and not present anywhere else on the form .
# # Create a new field on the entity when editing a form
&gt; When a field is created on the entity , it is not limited to the current form and will be available for use in other places .
# # # Navigate to an unmanaged solution

# Migrate identity providers to Azure AD B2C
# # Marking an identity provider as deprecate
You can configure your portal to mark other identity providers as deprecated and allow users to migrate to Azure AD B2C identity provider .
The following site settings are used to control the deprecation of identity providers :
The text on the screen for legacy authentication provider can be changed by using the following content snippet :
&gt; The deprecated identity providers are not shown when a user registers or redeems an invitation for a portal .
# # Migrating a deprecated identity provider to a new identity provider
If a portal user signs in with a deprecated identity provider , the account migration screen displays a message to sign in with a non-deprecated identity provider . When the user signs in with the non-deprecated identity provider , the user account is associated with the new provider .
The message on the screen for account migration can be changed using the following content snippets :
When a portal user selects a new identity provider and the identity is already associated with another contact record , an error message appears . You can configure the error message using the following content snippets :
&gt; If you mark local login as deprecated , the user will not be able to register for a new account .
The following field is added in the portal contact record to indicate if the local login is disabled for a user :
# # # Authentication key details
&gt; To view authentication key information , you must sign in to the portal in the same browser session and you must have all website access permission .
# # # Authentication key expiration notification
Email notifications are sent at the following intervals :
You &apos;ll also be notified after the key expires every day until 1 week after key expiration .
&gt; - Intervals are calculated in UTC from the key expiration date .
A message about key expiration is displayed at the top of the page .
&gt; You must sign in to your portal in the same browser session , and you must be assigned all website access permission .
# # Renew portal authentication key
You must renew the key every two years to ensure that your portal can connect to Common Data Service environment .
&gt; To renew the key , you must have permissions to manage your portal .
&gt; - While this process runs in the background , the portal will restart once .
&gt; - When you update a key , it &apos;s valid for next two years .
&gt; - This process will take five to seven minutes .
&gt; - Updating authentication key doesn &apos;t change any other portal configuration or the portal state .
If the key update fails , an error message is displayed along with the following action :

title : &quot; Translate localizable text for model-driven apps &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# Translate localizable text for model-driven apps
If you have customized entity or field text , such as field labels or drop-down list values , you can provide the users in your environment who are not working with the base language version of your environment with this customized text in their preferred languages .
The process has the following steps :
1 . Enable other languages for your environment
2 . Export the localizable text
3 . Get the localizable text translated
4 . Import the localized text
# # Enable other languages for your environment
# # Export the localizable text
The scope of the localizable text that will be exported is the unmanaged solution that contains the localizable text .
You could see an alert that says :
&gt; Exporting customized labels for translation can take several minutes . Do not click the export link again until the first export has finished . Are you sure that you want to export now ?
# # Get the localizable text translated
You can open the CrmTranslations.xml file with Microsoft Office Excel .
&gt; Make sure you do not change the file format . If you save the file in another format you will not be able to import it back .
Any custom entities or fields will have empty cells for the localizable text . Add the localized values for those items .
# # # Updating localizable text in the base language
&gt; Do not do a general find / replace in the file for this . You should take care that the matching text actually refers to the names you have changed .
# # Import the localized text
Importing the text requires compressing the files and importing them into the system .
# # # Compress the files
# # # Import the files
Select the file that contains the compressed translated text and select * * Import * * .
After the translated text is imported , you should publish all customizations to see the changes in your app ( s ) .
&gt; The community tools are not supported by Microsoft .
With Many-to-many relationships a Relationship ( or Intersect ) entity stores the data that associates the entities . This entity has a One-to-many entity relationship with both of the related entities and only stores the necessary values to define the relationship . You can ’ t add custom fields to a relationship entity and it is never visible in the user interface .
- Configure navigation pane options for model-driven apps .
- Hide the relationship from Advanced find in model-driven apps .

There are some advantages to configuring dataflows to store their definitions and datafiles in your data lake , including the following :
- It enables developers in your organization to integrate dataflow data into internal applications and line-of-business solutions , using developer resources for dataflows and Azure .
- A resource group . Use a resource group you already have , or create a new one .
3 . The storage account must have the Hierarchical Name Space feature enabled .
4 . You must be granted an Owner role on the storage account .
The following sections walk through the steps necessary to configure your Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account .
# # Create the storage account
2 . Make sure you enable the hierarchical namespace feature .
# # Select the storage account to use for dataflow storage
The * * Select Storage Account * * screen appears .
There are a few considerations and limitations to keep in mind when working with your dataflow storage :
- Linking an Azure Data Lake Store Gen2 account for dataflow storage is not supported in the default environment .
You can &apos;t change the storage location of a dataflow after it was created .
* When can I change the dataflow storage location of an environment ? *
Changing the environment &apos;s dataflow storage location is not currently supported .
This article provided guidance about how to connect an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account for dataflow storage .

title : &quot; Add geolocation to a managed form in a portal &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
A managed form can be configured to display a map control either to display an existing location as a pin on a map or to provide the ability for the user to specify a location .
To add geolocation functionality to a managed form , the following tasks must be completed .
Edit the entity form by using the form designer and make the following modifications :
The resulting form should look similar to the following . You can choose different display names for these fields . You can also choose to lay out these sections any way you prefer .
Geolocation with map functionality on managed forms requires configuration settings to complete requests with the mapping service REST endpoint . The following site settings are used to configure the location service .
The map control requires additional configuration to tell it what the IDs of the various location fields are , so it can assign values to them or retrieve values from them . The configuration depends on the type of managed form .
&gt; If you remove an option which has been used by an entity record the data for that record will become invalid after you save your changes to the global option set .
&gt; Before you remove an option that has been used , you should change the data in any entity record that uses that option to a valid value .
title : &quot; Create , edit or configure forms using the model-driven form designer &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# Create , edit , or configure forms using the form designer
Use the new form designer to create , edit , or configure forms for model-driven apps .
The contents of the new form are filled using the existing main form definition . If multiple main forms exist , the form at the top of the list in the form order is used to fill the new form .
These are the properties available to configure a form when you create or edit a form using the form designer .
# Size and location properties in Power Apps
Configure how big a control ( or an element of a control ) is and where it is in relation to the screen it &apos;s on .
# Working with Test Studio ( experimental )
&gt; You must save an app before you can write tests for the app .
&gt; Tests are published and stored in the app package . Exporting and importing a canvas app package to another environment will also include all the test definitions such as test suites and test cases you have created .
# # Create a test suite
# # Create a test case
1 . Select a test suite .
# # Record a test case
&gt; Only a published app plays in record mode . Publish any recent changes to the app before you start recording a test case . Recording without publishing recent changes causes the last published version of the app to play in record mode .
&gt; Recording on an existing test case overrides any existing test steps already present .
5 . Edit the step description text in the main grid if necessary . You can also update the test step actions by selecting the formula on the main grid .
# # # Add test steps and test assertions
Follow these steps to verify a successful record creation :
- Initialize a variable for the kudo record count in the database at the beginning of the test case .
- Initialize a variable for the kudo record count in the database at the end of the test case .
To add test steps and test assertions in the Kudos app :
1 . Select Step 1 or the step above which you want to insert a new step .
8 . Go to the bottom of the test case and insert a new step to count the records in the database after the test has completed .
# # Play back your test
You can play back your recorded test to validate app functionality . You can play back all tests within a single test suite , or a single test case .
Before you play the recording back with recent changes , you must publish the app :
&gt; If you skip publishing , the recording playback will not contain your recent test changes . The last published test case or suite will play against the app .
2 . Select either a test suite or a single test case .
In this section , you &apos;ll change the test assertion to experience a failed test :
1 . Edit the assertion step by selecting the expression box .
5 . View the test playing back . The final step now fails and shows an error and the message you provided in the assertion step .
To play tests in your browser :
1 . Select a test suite or test case in the right pane .
3 . You &apos;re prompted to publish your tests if there are any unpublished changes .
4 . You can select to skip the publish process and copy the play link . New test changes don &apos;t play if you skip .
5 . Open a browser and paste the URL into the address bar to play the test .
6 . View your test playing back .
- Always starting test execution from the first screen .
- Initializing common collections or variables .
- Fetching test data from a data source for the current executing test

# Form processing AI model requirements and limitations
Form processing works on input documents that meet the following requirements :
- JPG , .png , or PDF format ( text or scanned ) . Text-embedded PDFs are preferable because there is no possibility of error in character extraction and location .
- File size must be less than 4 megabytes ( MB ) .
- If scanned from paper documents , scans should be high-quality images .
- Must use the Latin alphabet ( English characters )
# # Optimization tips

Before you build your text classification model , you &apos;ll need to make sure your data is in Common Data Service , and in the correct format .
- Training data should be in a Common Data Service entity .
- Make sure your administrator has assigned you a security role with read privilege over the training data .
- Tags that contain fewer than 50 text items are ignored .
- Text must be fewer than 5,000 characters .
If we represent data in a table , it would look like this :
As an example , here is how to import training data from an Excel sheet . This example uses an Excel file like this :

# # Evenly distribute selected table
Selecting the * * Evenly distribute selected table * * option will calculate the longest value in each column and evenly distribute all the other values accordingly with space .
The feature will not impact the rendering of the table , but it will help to improve the readability of the table - thus making more maintainable . The reformatting table feature will keep column alignment intact .

# GitHub contribution workflow for major or long-running changes
Examples of these types of contributions include :
In this workflow , changes flow in a repetitive cycle . Starting from your device &apos;s local repository , they flow back up to your GitHub fork , into the main GitHub repository , and back down locally again as you incorporate changes from other contributors .
# # # Use GitHub flow
# # Saving changes to your repository
Next , you need to commit your saved changes to your local repository . This can be done in Git Bash by running :
You &apos;ve done it ! Your code is now up in your GitHub repository and ready for you to create a pull request .
You &apos;re now back in a new branch and you &apos;re well on your way to being a master contributer .
That &apos;s it ! You &apos;ve made a contribution to docs.microsoft.com content !
# # # Review and sign-off
When the pull request is issue-free and signed off , your changes are merged back into the parent branch and the pull request is closed .
title : Labels and projects roadmap
This roadmap explains how we use these organizational tools and has links to handy filters we use to find areas of interest .
We use labels to classify issues in many different ways :
We use labels for each of the architecture e-books and for each .NET Guide .
- Async Task
- C # Get Started
Priority labels are all `P` followed by a single digit . Lower numbers are higher priority :
# # # What about the other labels ?
There are many other labels used by the content teams to manage different classifications of issues . If you &apos;re not on the content team , you can ignore these other labels .
We use projects in two ways :
- Month YYYY project types : These are scrum boards for each month &apos;s working plan .
- Long-running epics : These are used to organize tasks toward a goal when the work will occur over several months .

# Set up Git repository locally for documentation
This article describes the steps to set up a Git repository on your local machine , with the intent to contribute to Microsoft documentation . Contributors may use a locally cloned repository to add new articles , do major edits on existing articles , or change artwork .
You run these one-time setup activities to start contributing :
&gt; * Determine the appropriate repository
&gt; * Fork the repository to your GitHub account
&gt; * Choose a local folder for the cloned files
&gt; * Clone the repository to your local machine
If you &apos;re new to GitHub , watch the following video for a conceptual overview of the forking and cloning process :

For example , these popular repositories are available for public contributions :
Using the appropriate repository , create a fork of the repository into your own GitHub account by using the GitHub website .
# # Choose a local folder
To determine the current directory , type `pwd` at the $ prompt .
# # Create a local clone
Your clone command should look similar to this example :
2 . When you &apos;re prompted , enter your GitHub credentials .
3 . When you &apos;re prompted , enter your two-factor authentication code .
&gt; Your credentials will be saved and used to authenticate future GitHub requests . You only need to do this authentication once per computer .

# Tutorial : Enhance business process flows with branching
The following diagram shows a business process flow with branches .
# # What you need to know when designing business process flows with branches
Take notice of the following information when you design the business process flow with the branches :
- A process can span across a maximum of 5 unique entities .
- You can use a maximum of 30 stages per process and a maximum of 30 steps per stage .
- Each branch can be no more that 5 levels deep .
- Branching rule must be based on the steps in the stage that immediately precedes it .
- You can combine multiple conditions in a rule by using the `AND` operator or the `OR` operator , but not both operators .
- More than one active process can run concurrently on the same data record .
- Client API changes cannot trigger evaluation of branching condition , as branching relies on Business rules .
&gt; - An entity used in the process can be revisited multiple times ( multiple closed entity loops ) .
# # Example : Car selling process flow with two branches
Let ’ s look at the example of the business process flow with two branches , for selling new and pre-owned cars .
First , we ’ ll create a new process named * * Car Sales Process * * .
1 . Configure the condition tile with rules that meet your business requirements
3 . To add the second branch that is executed when condition is not satisfied , add another Stage tile on the “ No ” path of the condition tile
&gt; You can add another condition on the “ no ” path of an existing condition tile to create more complex branching .
Consider a business process flow with branches for processing a loan request at a bank , as shown below . The custom entities used in the stages are shown in parenthesis .

Power Automate is a cloud-based service that makes it practical and simple for line-of-business users to build workflows that automate time-consuming business tasks and processes across applications and services .
Power Automate has two distinct audiences :
* Line-of-business “ Citizen Integrators ” in enterprise organizations who partner with IT to move responsibility for business solutions closer to the business itself .
To use Power Automate , all you need is a web browser and an email address .
You can run Power Automate on all modern devices , and browsers .
# # # # Supported devices
# # # # Supported browsers
We recommend that you use the most up-to-date browser that &apos;s compatible with your operating system . We support the following browsers :
# # # Which email addresses are supported ?
Power Automate supports email addresses that end with anything except .gov and .mil .
Power Automate is a public cloud service only . However , you can securely connect to your own on-premises services through the on-premises data gateway .
* Customer APIs
# # # What are templates ?
Templates are pre-built flows for popular and common scenarios . Using a template only requires you to have access to the services in the template and to fill out any required settings .
# # # What data sources will I be able to connect to ?
# # # Can I share the flows I create ?
You can share flows in either of these ways :
Get started with the following resources :
# # # Can flows be turned off or disabled ?
See the following table to understand how your flow responds when it &apos;s turned back on .
Trigger type &#124; Description
Webhook &#124; When the flow is turned on again , it only processes new events that are generated after the flow is turned on .
While you can create flows with a service account , we don &apos;t recommend doing so if the credentials for the service account are shared .

title : &quot; Work with business process flows using code &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
Different business process flow instances can run concurrently against the same entity record . Users can switch between concurrent business process instances , and resume their work at a current stage in the process .
This topic provides information about how you can programmatically work with business process flows .
# # Prerequisites for business process flow
&gt; Enabling an entity for business process flow is a one way process . You can ’ t reverse it .
# # Define business process flow
By default , a business process flow record is created in the `Draft` state .
# # Activate business process flow
&gt; You can also use the business process flow designer to activate a business process flow .
# # Business process flow entity
&gt; The sample business process flow records use system entities to store the corresponding business process flow instance records .
&gt; However , any new business process flow definitions you create will use custom entities to store its instance records as explained earlier .
You can retrieve the name of your business process flow entity using any of the following ways :
# # Manage security for business process flows
At this point , you might not get any instances in your response as there are none . Run this request after creating an instance of your business process flow definition later in this topic .
Create a business process flow entity record ( process instance ) programmatically if you want to switch to another business process flow for an entity record without using the UI .
To create a business process flow entity record , you need to specify the following values :
You can update a process instance to move to next or previous stage , abandon a process instance , reactivate a process instance , or finish a process instance .
# # # # Stage navigation
To navigate to a different stage , you need to update a process instance record to change its active stage ID and accordingly update the traversed path . Note that you must only move to the next or previous stage while updating a business process flow instance .
&gt; You can abort a process instance at any stage .
Use the following Web API request :
# # Use RetrieveProcessInstances and RetrieveActivePath messages
# # Apply business process flow while creating an entity record
By default , for an entity that has multiple business process flows defined for it , the system applies a business process flow to the new entity record using the following multi-step logic :
- If the business app does not contain any business process flow then business process flow is applied as explained until step 3 .
- If no business process flow is available in a business app for the entity or one that the user has access to then no business process flow is applied for the new entity record .
- Set it to a specific business process flow entity ( as an entity reference ) . In this case , the system will apply the specified business process flow instead of the default logic .
&gt; Overriding the default logic of business process flows getting applied automatically to new entity records is only supported programmatically . You cannot do this using the UI .
# # Legacy process-related attributes in entities
# # Client-side programmability support for business process flows
# # Maximum number of processes , stages , and steps
The following settings aren ’ t customizable :
- The maximum number of stages per entity in the process is 30 .
- The maximum number of steps in each stage is 30 .
- The maximum number of entities that can participate in the process flow is 5 .
This card is comprised of three sections :
1 . The topic header area with header , sub-header , and description .
1 . A column set which supports a table array of data
1 . Set the schedule as follows to repeat every week , at a time and time zone of your choice :
You can use this sample JSON content for the * * Message * * :
1 . Give your flow a name and save it .
Notice , after the recurrence time elapses , the flow posts the adaptive card &apos;s content to the team channel that you defined .
# Create your first adaptive card
In either case you will need to sketch out which datasets you will share , and / or what data the form will need to collect .
&gt; Use simple blocks of data rather than complex table arrays .
In this procedure , you ’ ll add an action which will use the data from previous actions in the flow to post information to a Microsoft Teams channel .
1 . Give your flow a name .
1 . Make the following replacements in the JSON .
&gt; Do not remove any quotation marks when you do the replacements . You can revise the car choices to suit your needs :
Text to change &#124; New text
Header Tagline Text &#124; Power Automate Poll
Poll Header &#124; Preferred Car Model
&#124; Poll Question &#124; Please vote on your preferred car model from the choices listed here .
# # Test your adaptive card
To test your work , run the flow you created earlier and confirm the following :
- The Teams channel has the new adaptive card posted .
- No errors should occur on the adaptive card .
- The email notification contains the body that shows who submitted the response and which car was selected .
Congratulations ! you ’ ve just made your first interactive adaptive card !
# # Troubleshooting tips for adaptive cards
The most common problems that you will encounter when creating adaptive cards are :
- Flow run errors are often caused by one of the following factors :
In this case the error may resemble this screenshot :
- Improperly formatted JSON – This is not usually as complex as one might expect . These are most often just situations where :
- Adaptive Cards may not look like what ’ s expected during to styling and schema constraints :
- Errors following Adaptive Card submission are often due to :
- Using an action which does not include ‘ wait for response ’ in the name
- Attempting to submit the card more than once . Each Adaptive Card can only be submit once , after which all further submissions will be ignored .
title : &quot; Best practices for managing workflow processes &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# Best practices for workflow processes
This topic contains best practices for creating and managing workflow processes .
# # Automatically delete completed workflow jobs
# # Keep logs for workflow jobs that encountered errors
# # Limit the number of workflows that update the same entity
# # Use Notes to keep track of changes
When you edit workflows you should use the Notes tab and type what you did and why you did it . This allows someone else to understand the changes you made .
# # Collect information from the user
To collect information from the user using a form , users can select the * * Create Adaptive Card * * button within the trigger .
This displays an inline adaptive card editor which lets you drag and drop card elements to construct your own form .
# # # Use the message details within the flow
There several message elements available as a trigger output for use within the flow . Here &apos;s an overview of some of properties :
* Message content - The full HTML content of the Teams message .
* Plain text message output - The plain text variation of the Teams message .
* Link to message - A direct url to reference the message .
* Sender display name , Sender id - The details of the user who sent the message .
* Originating user display name , originating user id - The details of the user who invoked the flow .
&gt; The name of the flow is used to reference the flow within Teams so be sure to provide a descriptive name for the flow .
&gt; You must create these flows within the default environment to ensure they get listed in Teams .
Here &apos;s an example of a flow that creates a work item in Azure Devops and then posts a confirmation to the originating user .
You must create these flows within the default environment to ensure they get listed in Teams .
# # What is Power Automate ?
# # What can you do with Power Automate ?
For example , you can * * automate * * these tasks :
* Instantly respond to high-priority notifications or emails .
* Capture , track , and follow up with new sales leads .
* Collect data about your business , and share that information with your team .
* Automate approval workflows .
And finally , * * you can automate approval loops * * for , as an example , vacation requests in a SharePoint list .
Got an idea for a flow that you don &apos;t see in the list ? Create your own from scratch and , if you want , share it with the community !
You can perform these tasks , among others :
* Turn flows on or off from wherever you are .
* See when a flow has failed .
* Review detailed run-history reports .
* View and filter runs by notification type .
# # A brief tour of Power Automate
On the home page , there are menus for :
# Best practices in using business process flow attributes
# # Reporting on the active stage of a business process flow
Let ’ s say that you ’ d like to get a view of your sales pipeline by reporting on the active stage that the * * Lead to Opportunity Sales Process * * is on .
In our example , follow these steps to go to the * * Lead to Opportunity Sales Process * * entity :
Here , you can define views and charts just as you do on any other entity .
An advantage of this approach is that you can use a single view or chart to report on business process flows that span multiple entities .
Here are a few things to keep in mind when you use this approach :
1 . As reporting is driven from the related entity , it &apos;s not possible to create a single view that reports on business process flows that span multiple entities .
Here are some cases in which you might want to run logic that &apos;s based on the active stage :
# # # Using the active stage to run client-side logic
As you use the business process , there are many things that you might want to do automatically . For instance :
- Change the active business process flow based on newly available information on the form or business process flow .
- Move the active stage to the next or previous stage , based on values the users entered for steps or form fields .
- Hide or show form tabs and fields based on the selected stage .
- Show informative messages and run calculations based on the active business process flows , the active or selected stage , or events such as moving the active stage .
# # # Using the active stage to run server-side logic
There might be cases where automation based on the business process flow needs to be done server side . For instance :
1 . Create an appointment and phone call record for the internal review of the solution and the customer call to review the solution respectively .

# Create approval flows with attachments
In this article , you ’ ll learn how to create an approval flow that sends an attachment that the approver needs to review before deciding if the request should be approved .
The previous steps configure your flow so that when it runs , it requests a file from the user to trigger your flow .
&gt; You must include the file extension that matches the file type that &apos;s uploaded .
You &apos;ll see that the test run starts .
&gt; Approvers can review requests in the approvals center as well .

Here are the steps you must follow to add custom controls to a business process flow :
1 . Configure custom controls on a related entity form .
1 . Generate and exporting the business process flow form .
# Tutorial : Create a business process flow to standardize processes
When a user starts a business process flow , the stages and steps of the process are displayed in the process bar at the top of a form :
# # Create a business process flow
You cannot change the category after you create the process .
The new process is created , and the business process flow designer opens with a single stage already created for you .
- Enter a display name .
1 . Enter a display name for the step .
1 . Enter a display name .
2 . Select when the workflow should be triggered .
&gt; As long as a process is a draft , people won ’ t be able to use it .
&gt; The System Administrator and System Customizer security roles have access to new business process flows by default .
Next , don &apos;t forget to assign the security role to appropriate users in your organization .
&gt; Here are a few tips to keep in mind as you work on your task flow in the designer window :
# # Edit a business process flow
# # Other things to know about business process flows
Business process flows can have up to 30 stages .
You can add or change the following properties of a stage :
- Relationships often have attribute maps defined that automatically carry over data between records , minimizing data entry .
Each stage can have up to 30 steps .
Users have access to a business process flow depending on the privilege defined on the business process flow in the security role assigned to the user .
# # Add an on-demand action to a business process flow
# # # Add on-demand workflows or actions using an Action Step
- Creates a task record that is assigned to the opportunity reviewer .
- Appends “ Ready for review ” to the opportunity topic .
Next , the Action Step is added to Contoso ’ s opportunity business process flow . Then the process flow is validated and updated .
&gt; - The entity associated with the action or workflow must be the same as the entity associated with the business process flow .
# # # Limitation of using Action Steps in a business process flow
# # Instant flows in business process flows
# # # Add an instant flow as a step in a business process
To do this , you &apos;ll need to do two things :
1 . Build an instant flow that requests review and approval of the proposal from the team .
# # # Build an instant flow
1 . Add a text input field for the user to enter the link to the proposal .
We &apos;ll need information from the business process flow instance to help provide context for the approval request so follow these steps to do this .
Things should look like this now :
1 . Finally , save the flow and then turn it on .
Now that you &apos;ve created the instant flow , all that &apos;s needed is for you to add it to your business process flow .
# # The action center
- The name of the process .
- The current stage for each process .
- The owner of the Common Data Service record associated with the active stage .
- The time since the instance was created .
To see the
To get these two parameters .
2 . Select the environment you use to build your flows .
3 . Copy the organization id and region subdomain from the environment URL .
The response contains the list of flows from within that environment :
&#124; createdon &#124; The date when the flow was created . &#124;
&#124; modifiedon &#124; The last time the flow was updated . &#124;
&#124; description &#124; The user-provided description of the flow . &#124;
You can also provide a description and statecode .
There are three properties :
In another example , you can turn a flow on with this call :
Delete a flow with a simple `DELETE` call :
# # Get all users with whom a flow is shared
# # Share or unshare a flow
You can share a flow using the `GrantAccess` action .
&#124; ReadAccess &#124; The right to read the flow . &#124;
&#124; WriteAccess &#124; The right to update the flow . &#124;
&#124; DeleteAccess &#124; The right to delete the flow . &#124;
&#124; ShareAccess &#124; The right to share the flow . &#124;
&#124; AssignAccess &#124; The right to change the owner of the flow . &#124;
`RevokeAccess` removes all permissions granted in the `AccessMask` .
Once your flow is in a solution , call the following action :
`ExportSolution` returns a base 64-encoded string in the `ExportSoutionFile` property .
You can then save this file into source control and / or use whatever version management or distribution system you want .
Call the `ImportSolution` action to import a solution .
&#124; CustomizationFile &#124; A base 64-encoded zip file that contains the solution . &#124;
# Custom Common Data Service workflow activities ( workflow assemblies )
# Run your flows by pressing a Flic smart button ( Preview )
To use Flics with Power Automate , you must have :
Use Flic &apos;s mobile app to program the Flic &apos;s events . The events are :
* click ( one quick press )
* double-click ( two quick presses )
This screenshot shows a sample of what your Flic configuration process might be like :
# # Create a flow that &apos;s triggered by a Flic
1 . Review the template &apos;s details and note that this template requires a spreadsheet in Google Sheets .
Note : You use this sheet later in this walkthrough .
# # # Add the Flic trigger to your flow
* * Continue * * is enabled after you sign into all required services for the template .
# # # Configure the sheet
# # # Confirm the email settings are correct
# # # Save your flow and test it
1 . Give your flow a name , and then save it .
If you &apos;ve followed along , pressing the Flic once triggers the flow . The flow then records the click type and the current time in the sheet and then sends an email to you .
1 . Press your Flic once .
4 . Here &apos;s what the body of the notification email that I received from the run of the flow looks like .
For extra credit , consider extending the flow to automatically record your location ( latitude and longitude ) when the Flic is pressed .
When you design workflows you have the option to contain the logic you want to perform in stages and steps .
Stages make the workflow logic easier to read , and explain the workflow logic . However , stages do not affect the logic or behavior of workflows . If a process has stages , all the steps within the process must be contained with a stage .
Steps are a unit of business logic within a workflow . Steps can include conditions , actions , other steps , or a combination of these elements .
# # Actions that workflow processes can perform
Workflow processes can perform the actions listed in the following table .
# # # Setting record values
At the bottom of the dialog you can see a list of additional fields not present in the form .
# # Setting conditions for workflow actions
# # # Converting between real-time and background workflows
You can change a real-time workflow into a background workflow by choosing * * Convert to a background workflow * * on the toolbar .
# # # Initiating real-time workflows before or after status changes
# # # Using the Stop Workflow action with real-time workflows
Follow these steps to edit a solution-aware flow .
1 . Select the solution that contains the flow you want to edit .
1 . Turn on your flow if you &apos;d like it to run .
You must have the following components to create solutions , and solution-aware flows :
- An environment with version 9.1.0.267 or later .

title : &quot; Business process flows overview &#124; MicrosoftDocs &quot;
# # Why use business process flows ?
Business process flows provide a guide for people to get work done . They provide a streamlined user experience that leads people through the processes their organization has defined for interactions that need to be advanced to a conclusion of some kind . This user experience can be tailored so that people with different security roles can have an experience that best suits the work they do .
# # What can business process flows do ?
# # # Business process flows integrated with other customizations
# # # Concurrent process flows
# # # System business process flows
The following business process flows are included . To understand how business process flows work , review these system business process flows :
- Lead to Opportunity Sales Process
- Opportunity Sales Process
- Phone to Case Process
# # Multiple entities in business process flows
You can design business process flows that tie together the records for up to five different entities into a single process so that people using the app can focus on the flow of their process rather than on which entity they are working in . They can more easily navigate between related entity records .
# # Multiple business process flows are available per entity
# # # Control which business process flow will be applied
You can associate business process flows with security roles so that only people with those security roles can see or use them . You can also set the order of the business process flows so that you can control which business process flow will be set by default . This works in the same way that multiple forms for an entity are defined .
# # # Business process flows that call a workflow
# # # Entities that can use business process flows
All custom entities can use business process flows . The following standard entities can also use business process flows :
- Recurring Appointment
# # # Maximum number of processes , stages , and steps
To ensure acceptable performance and the usability of the user interface , there are some limitations you need to be aware of when you plan to use business process flows :
- There can be no more than 10 activated business process flow processes per entity .
- Each process can contain no more than 30 stages .
- Multi-entity processes can contain no more than five entities .
# # # Interact with the business process flow entity from a workflow
# # # Run business process flows offline
You can use business process flows offline if the following conditions are met :
- The business process flow is used from a Power Apps app .
- The Power Apps app is enabled for offline use .
- The business process flow has a single entity .
- Next stage
- Previous stage
- Set Active stage
# # # Limitations of using business process flow entities
- Currently , you can ’ t create custom forms for entities based on a business process flow .

In our next topic , we ’ ll see what it looks like when an approver receives a new request for a proposed tweet .
Workflows automate business processes without a user interface . People usually use workflow processes to initiate automation that doesn ’ t require any user interaction .
Each workflow process is associated with a single entity . When configuring workflows you have four major areas to consider :
- When to start them ?
- Should they run as a real-time workflow or a background workflow ?
- What actions should they perform ?
- Under what conditions should actions be performed ?
# # Where do you customize workflow processes ?
Depending on how the app is built , users can create or modify their workflows in the app .
When you create a workflow the * * Create Process * * dialog requires that you set three properties that all processes have :
This property establishes that this is a workflow process .
Each workflow process must be set to a single entity . You can ’ t change the entity after the workflow process is created .
After you create the Workflow or if you edit an existing one , you will have the following additional properties :
Process templates are convenient when you have a number of similar workflow processes and want to define them without duplicating the same logic .
&gt; Editing a process template does not change the behaviors of any other workflow processes previously created using it as a template . A new workflow created using a template is a copy of the content in the template .
This section contains options that describe how the workflow is available to be run .
* * As an on-demand process * *
Choose this option if you want to allow users to run this workflow from the * * Run Workflow * * command .
* * As a child process * *
This section contains an option to delete a workflow after the workflow execution has completed .
Choose this option , if you want a completed workflow job to be automatically deleted .
&gt; The workflow jobs are not deleted immediately upon completion , but soon after , through a batch process .
# # Security context of workflow processes
Workflows are saved when they are activated , so it is not necessary to save them before activating them .
&#91; Add an on-demand workflow to a business process flow &#93; ( bpf-add-on-demand-workflow.md )
From this section , you can create a new UI flow and edit or delete your existing UI flows .
For each of your UI flows , you can see its details by selecting its name from the list of UI flows . You then see details including :
- The run history with details of each run .
- The applications or Websites used in the UI flow .
Follow these steps to see the details for a UI flow :
1 . Select any of your UI flows .
You should see your new Twitter connection and any other connections you have created .
# # Build a SharePoint List
The first thing you need to do is create a new SharePoint Online list for Contoso Flooring .
Your list is built , so now you can build the flow .
# # # Choose a trigger

- Dependencies on canvas apps are tracked in the same way as dependencies in Dynamics 365 apps .
Can I launch a canvas app as a popup from a button in the command bar ?
Can workflows be called from a canvas app ?
Can I automatically convert dialogs to business process flows or canvas apps ?
- There is no automated way to convert dialogs to business process flows or canvas apps .

title : Call Child Flows
Let &apos;s look at an example where you have a child flow that you want to create or update a contact in Common Data Service based on that contact &apos;s name .
You will need a solution with two flows :
# # Create the child flow in a solution
The input you define here will be passed in to the child flow from the parent flow .
1 . Build the logic that you want the child flow to run . This logic can contain as many steps as you need .
1 . Give your flow a descriptive name and then save it .
# # Create the parent flow in a solution
1 . Build the parent flow in the same solution in which you created the child flow .
Alternatively , you can bring an existing flow into that solution . The parent flow can have any type of trigger .
1 . Pick the child flow that you created earlier .
# Create an automated flow by using Common Data Service
You can use any of the following triggers to initiate your flow :
- When a record is selected
- When a record is created
- When a record is deleted
- When a record is updated
You can use scopes to determine if your flow runs if you create a new record , if a new record is created by a user within your business unit , or if a new record is created by any user in your organization .
&#124; Business Unit &#124; Action is taken on a record owned by your business unit &#124;
&#124; Organization &#124; Action is taken by anyone within the organization or database &#124;
&#124; Parent : Child business unit &#124; Action is taken on a record owned by your business unit or a child business unit &#124;
&#124; User &#124; Action is taken on a record owned by you &#124;
Triggers that run when a record is updated can also use filtering attributes . This ensures that the flow only runs when any of the defined attributes are updated .
This flow triggers any time the first or last name of contact that the flow user owns is updated .
Use any of the following actions to write data into Common Data Service :
- Create a new record
- Update a record
Here &apos;s an example of creating a follow-up task when the given user creates a new account record .
To write data into customer , owner , and regarding fields , two fields must be populated .
&#124; Field category &#124; Example settings &#124;
&#124; Customer &#124; Represents the ID of the record and the customer type as selected from the list . &#124;
&#124; Owner &#124; Represents the ID of the system user or team , and owner type as selected from the list . &#124;
# # # Enable upsert behavior
Create a vacation request in the SharePoint Online list you created earlier .
After you save this request , the flow triggers , and then :
1 . Creates a request in the approvals center .
2 . Sends an approval request email to the approvers .

After you enter a name for the process , a unique name will be created for it by removing any spaces or special characters from the process name .
This property establishes that this is an action process . You can ’ t change this after you save the process .
Use this property to choose whether to build a new action from scratch or to start from an existing template .
Unlike workflow processes , you don ’ t need to set the following options :
Actions also have something that workflow processes don ’ t – input and output arguments .
You must deactivate processes before you can edit them .
When an action is saved , a unique name is generated based on the process name . This unique name has the customization prefix added from the solution publisher . This is the name of the message that a developer will use in their code .
When editing an action you have the following options :
After the process is created and the unique name is generated from the process name , you can edit the process name . You might want to apply a naming convention to make it easier to locate specific processes .
&gt; After the action is activated and code is written to use a unique name , the unique name must not be changed without also changing the code that references it .
&gt; You can ’ t enable rollback if a custom action is invoked directly from within a workflow . You can enable rollback if an action is triggered by a Power Apps web services message .
Like all processes , you can activate the process as a template and use it as an advanced starting point for processes that follow a similar pattern .
# # # Action process argument types
The following table describes the action process argument types .
&#124; DateTime &#124; A value that stores date and time information . &#124;
&#124; Money &#124; A value that stores data about an amount of money . &#124;
&#124; Picklist &#124; A value that represents an option for an OptionSet attribute . &#124;

# Responding to GDPR Data Subject Delete Requests for Power Automate
The following table shows which personal data is automatically deleted and which data requires an administrator to manually review and delete :
&#124; User details &#124; Gateway permissions &#124;
Here is the breakdown of experiences that are available for an administrator to delete each types of personal data within each type of resource :
The steps below describe how administrative functions exist to serve delete requests for GDPR . These steps should be performed in the order outlined below .
&gt; To avoid data corruption , follow these steps in order .
1 . The copy now performs the same workflow logic as the original version .
# # Delete approval history from Power Automate
# # Delete connections created by a user
Connections are used in conjunction with connectors to establish connectivity with other APIs and SaaS systems . Connections include references to the user who created them and as a result , can be deleted to remove any references to the user .
Power Apps Maker PowerShell cmdlets
# # Delete the user ’ s permissions to shared connections
# # Delete custom connectors created by the user
# # Delete the user ’ s permissions to shared custom connectors
# # Delete or reassign all environments created by the user
As an admin you have two decisions to make when processing a DSR delete request for a user for each of the environments that has been created by the user :
1 . If you determine that the environment is not being used by anyone else in your organization then you can choose to delete the environment
# # Delete the user ’ s permissions to all other environments
# # Delete the user from Azure Active Directory
# # Delete the user from Unmanaged Tenant
To determine whether or not you are a user of a managed or unmanaged tenant , perform the following actions :
1 . Otherwise , you belong to a managed tenant .
# Create flows from the OneDrive for Business launch panel
1 . Select one of the templates .
In this example , select the * * Request my manager &apos;s approval for the selected file * * template .
&gt; Sign into any connectors that requests that you sign in .
1 . Make any changes you want to the template and then save your flow with a name that you &apos;ll remember easily .
1 . Find , and then select the file on which request manager approval .
1 . Select the flow you created earlier .
* Value : * Approve *
* A Twitter account
1 . If prompted , select the sign-in button , and then provide your credentials .
Within a minute after the tweet is posted , an email message notifies you of the new tweet .
1 . In the list of flows , do any of the following :
Select a flow run from the list of runs to see the inputs and outputs of each step .
# Configure custom actions from a workflow
You may also create an action so that a developer can use it in code or you may need to edit an action that was previously defined . Like workflow processes , consider the following :
- What should the action do ?
- Under what conditions should the action be performed ?
* * Add Stages , Conditions and Actions * *
# # # Define process arguments
# # # # Action process argument types
* To use the template demonstrated in this topic , you &apos;ll also need :
* Push notifications enabled on your phone .
You can find a template in any of these ways :
* Specify a keyword in the search box at the top of the screen .
* Tap an option in the list of services .
* Scroll down to show a variety of categories , and then tap a template in any category .
For this tutorial , you &apos;ll open the template that sends a push notification when you get mail from your manager .
You can use the same connections when you create other flows .
Your flow is created and will check for mail from your manager until you pause or delete the flow .
title : Monitor activity from your phone &#124; Microsoft Docs
# Monitor activity in Power Automate from your phone
The flow in this tutorial runs when you receive mail from a specific address :
When the flow runs , it sends a custom push notification , with this syntax , to your phone :
# # Display a summary of activity
It might take some time for the data to appear in the app .
This tab organizes data by day , with today &apos;s data at the top .
Each entry shows the name of a flow with icons that correspond to its trigger events and actions .
If a flow sends a push notification , the text of the most recent notification appears at the bottom of the entry for successful runs .
5 . To filter the activity summary , tap the icon in the upper-right corner .
You can show all entries , only the failure entries , or only the entries that include push notifications .
# # Show details of a run
1 . In the activity summary , tap an entry to show details for the most recent run .
# Manage flows in Power Automate from your phone
# Manage connections in Power Automate
For example , you can use a connection to perform these tasks :
* Update a SharePoint list .
* Get data from an Excel file in your OneDrive for Business or Dropbox account .
# # Connect to your data through an on-premises data gateway
1 . Follow the steps earlier in this topic to add a connection .
&gt; Microsoft SharePoint data gateways support HTTP traffic but not HTTPS traffic .
You can update a connection that isn &apos;t working because your account details or your password changed .
2 . When prompted , update your connection with new credentials .
title : Learn how to export solution-aware flows &#124; Microsoft Docs
Follow these steps to move your solution and its dependencies to a new environment :
1 . Select the solution you want to export .
1 . Save the solution with a name of your choice .
# # Create and process a request
First we need to add an item to our SharePoint list , then we can process an approval request for that item .
In this topic , you saw the experience from the approver ’ s point of view - from receiving an approval request email , to processing the request in the Approval Center .
The first thing you &apos;ll need is a trigger . The button flow is a convenient one to use .
# # Create a team flow
2 . Enter names , email addresses , or user groups to add co-owners .
3 . To remove co-owners , select the trash can to the right of their name .
The worker then shared that button out to the team , so others could trigger the same flow if that person wasn ’ t around .
# Overview of Adaptive Cards for Microsoft Teams
Since Adaptive Cards adapt to their host , they are perfect vehicles for sharing information between Microsoft Teams and other services .
&gt; When you use this card , the flow waits for a response from any Teams member .
- Only the information within the ‘ Update message ’ input box ( see image 3 ) will be shown on the replacement card after consumers submit the card .
&gt; This content will be updated to reflect the branding change in the coming days .
# Use expressions in conditions to check multiple values
You can use any combination of the following logical expressions in your conditions .
# # Use the or expression
Here &apos;s an example of what the spreadsheet might look like :
Let &apos;s create the flow .
2 . Set the schedule to run once daily .
# # # Select the spreadsheet and get all rows
# # # Check the status column of each row
The * * or * * expression appears as shown here :
Your * * Condition * * card resembles this image :
# # # Delete matching rows from the spreadsheet
# # # Name the flow and save it
# # # Run the flow with the or expression
The flow runs after you save it . If you created the spreadsheet shown earlier in this walkthrough , here &apos;s what the it looks like after the run completes :
# # Use the and expression
# # # Run the flow with the and expression
After your flow runs , your spreadsheet resembles this image :
# # Use the empty expression
After your flow runs , the spreadsheet resembles this image :
Notice extra lines are removed from the table .
Here &apos;s a view of the spreadsheet :
Here &apos;s the implementation of the * * greater * * expression that identifies all persons who have paid less than the amount due from them :

After you select a trigger , you &apos;ll need to configure :
- A condition for the trigger .
- The name of the entity .
- The scope for the trigger .
You can add any of these conditions to determine precisely when your flow is triggered .
# # # The entity name
Select any of the numerous entities that are available to indicate the entity on which your trigger operates .
Use scopes to determine if your flow runs when you , someone in your business unit , or any user in your organization creates a record .
Here are the details on each scope .
&gt; If you have two updates that happen within seconds of each other , the flow may be triggered more than once with the latest versioned content .

title : Use inputs and outputs in desktop UI flows &#124; Microsoft Docs
# Use inputs and outputs in desktop UI flows
Use inputs to pass information from an external source such as a database or any supported connector to the legacy software that UI flows automates .
# # Define inputs in the UI flows
- Sample data is used during the recording or test .
- The description will be helpful to differentiate the inputs that you have created .
- For sensitive text inputs , the sample value will be obscured and will not be persisted after saving
1 . Once your inputs are created , you can click on next to use them in a recording .
# # Use inputs to pass information to the application
1 . In the list , you can choose between three options :
&gt; You can identify sensitive text inputs easily because they have a different icon from text inputs .
In example that follows , you will see that “ Invoice Account ” is used as the value .
&gt; If you also used a sensitive text input , you would see an action with a lock icon on the top right to indicate that you used sensitive text input .
# # Use outputs to extract information from the app
For example , you can extract customer information your legacy accounting software and add it to a SharePoint list .
Outputs can only be created as you record your UI flow .
1 . Provide a name and a description for the output .
Your output is now available in the dedicated area of the wizard .
- An output name as defined during the recording .
- A description : This field can be very useful when you define many outputs during a recording and want to easily identify them later .
- An action name : the action in which the output is defined in your UI flow .
# # Use clipboard content to define outputs
During a recording , it is possible to copy a text in the clipboard of your computer and to define it as output of your UI flow .
1 . During your recording , copy a string value
If you do not need an output anymore , delete it by going to the associated action and removing the Output name in the dynamic value .
Testing UI flows lets you validate your changes and the appropriate playback behavior .
1 . ( Optional ) Enter a value in the input field .
&gt; For any sensitive text inputs that are created in the recorder , the sample value will need to be specified again before testing .
1 . Once playback completes , you see the run status of your UI flow :
- For each action , a status indicator that shows that the test worked well , along with the associated inputs .
- You will also see the value of the outputs obtained for this test at the bottom of the designer .
- If an error occurs , you &apos;ll see which step caused the problem along with a screenshot at the moment the error occurred .

# # What is an environment :
# # Purposes for an environment
You can use environments to :
* Separate apps , flows and business data based on different roles , security requirements or users .
* Manage test and production environments .
# # How to use environments
Environments can serve several different purposes , depending on your organizational needs , some examples are :
* You can choose to build all your apps and flows in a single environment .
* You could choose to create an environment for different types of apps and flows . For example , you could create an environment for test and another environment for production .
# # What are roles ?
1 . Name your environment .
4 . Optionally select who will have access to the database . You can either restrict access or give everyone access to the database .
# # Add users to an environment
After you create an environment , you can add users to either the Environment Admin role or the Environment Maker role . As with all other administrative tasks , you do this from the admin center .
You &apos;ll learn about :
* The features that environments provide .
* Switching between environments .
* How to create a flow in the right environment .
# # Here are a few scenarios for using environments
Scenario &#124; Recommendation
Follow these steps to switch environments :
1 . In the top right corner , you see an image that represents your profile .
1 . Select the image . A drop-down list displays all the environments available to you . The environment in which you &apos;re currently signed in is checked :
1 . To switch to another environment , select that environment in the list :
1 . Power Automate switches to the new environment .
# # Create flows in the right environment
Before you create a flow , select the environment into which you &apos;ll add the flow and its resources .
&gt; If you create a flow in the wrong environment , you &apos;ll have to delete it , and then create it in the correct environment .
Consider the following factors when choosing an environment to host your flows :
&gt; You &apos;ll always be able to create flows in the default environment .

This tutorial will guide you through understanding and creating some calculated columns and using them in report visualizations in Power BI Desktop .
# # Create a calculated column with values from related tables
An opening parenthesis appears , along with another suggestion list of the related columns you can pass to the RELATED function , with descriptions and details of expected parameters .
# # Use your new column in a report
# # Create a calculated column that uses an IF function
# # What you &apos;ve learned
# # Download the report as a .pbix file
To download the .pbix file , follow these steps :
There are a few important considerations and limitations associated with downloading a .pbix file from the Power BI service .
* To download the file , you must have edit access to the report .
* This feature won &apos;t work with reports and content packs originally created in the Power BI service .
* If your administrator has turned off the ability to download data , this feature won &apos;t be visible in the Power BI service .
* Datasets with incremental refresh can &apos;t be downloaded to a .pbix file .
Here are some additional articles that can help you learn to use the Power BI service :
After you &apos;ve installed Power BI Desktop , see the following article to help you get up and running quickly :
title : &apos; Organizational content packs : Access and copy&apos;
# Organizational content packs : Copy , refresh , and get access
# # Create a copy of an organizational content pack
Now you have a copy that you can change . Nobody else will see changes you make .
&gt; Previously , each time you installed a content pack or created a copy one , a new dataset would appear in the workspace content list . A recent update simplified the experience to show just one item using the new referenced dataset icon :
# # Help ! I can no longer access the content pack
This can happen for several reasons :
# # How are organizational content packs refreshed ?
When the content pack is created , the refresh settings are inherited with the dataset . When you create a copy of the content pack , the new version retains its link to the original dataset and its refresh schedule .

# Dataset connectivity with the XMLA endpoint ( Preview )
# # What &apos;s an XMLA endpoint ?
# # Data modeling and management tools
Object level security ( OLS ) is not yet supported in Power BI Premium datasets .
# # Optimize datasets for write operations
# # Connecting to a Premium workspace
# # # To get the workspace connection URL
When connecting to a dataset with the same name as another dataset in the same workspace , append the dataset guid to the dataset name . You can get both dataset name and guid when connected to the workspace in SSMS .
# # # Delay in datasets shown
When connecting to a workspace , changes from new , deleted , and renamed datasets can take up to a few minutes to appear .
The following datasets are not accessible by the XMLA endpoint . These datasets will not appear under the workspace in SSMS or in other tools :
- Datasets with Push data by using the REST API .
Access through the XMLA endpoint will honor security group membership set at the workspace / app level .
The following limitations apply when working with dataset roles through the XMLA endpoint :
- Object-level security ( OLS ) rules are not currently supported in Power BI .
When the Deployment Server property has been specified , the project can then be deployed .
When connected , the workspace is shown as an Analysis Services server , and datasets in the workspace are shown as databases .
When applications connect to a workspace , access through XMLA endpoints is logged in the Power BI audit logs with the following operations :
&#124; Operation friendly name &#124; Operation name &#124;
&#124; Connected to Power BI dataset from an external application &#124; ConnectFromExternalApplication &#124;

# Query folding guidance in Power BI Desktop
Query folding guidance differs based on the model mode .
The following bulleted-list provides specific guidance .
For a relational data source , if the step that prevents query folding could be achieved in a single SELECT statement — or within the procedural logic of a stored procedure — consider using a native SQL query , as described next .
There are two important considerations you need to bear in mind when using native SQL queries :
- Incremental refresh can &apos;t use a native SQL query . So , it would force the Power Query mashup engine to retrieve all source rows , and then apply filters to determine incremental changes .

Let &apos;s get more specific .
Notice how Power BI answers the question as you type and displays the appropriate chart .
3 . Experiment with more questions and see what kind of results you get .
4 . When you &apos;re ready , return to the dashboard .
# # Dive deeper into the data
Now let &apos;s explore on a more detailed level , looking at the districts &apos; performances .
Let &apos;s see if we can narrow down where the issues might be .
Observe that although the men &apos;s category wasn &apos;t as severely affected in April as the overall business , January and July were still problematic months .
Notice the women &apos;s category performed much worse than the overall business across all months , and in almost every month compared to the previous year .
1 . Select the bubble again to clear the filter .
# # Try out the slicer
Let &apos;s look at how specific districts are doing .
Note that Allan &apos;s district outperformed in March and June , compared to last year .
3 . Explore the other district managers and categories ; what other insights can you find ?
4 . When you are ready , return to the dashboard .
# # What the data says about sales growth this year
The last area we want to explore is our growth by examining the new stores opened this year .
As evident from the tile , more Fashions Direct stores than Lindseys stores opened this year .
Notice the difference in average sales / square foot across the new stores .

title : Many-to-many relationship guidance
There are , in fact , three many-to-many scenarios . They can occur when you &apos;re required to :
Here &apos;s a simplistic model diagram of the three tables .
To help describe how the relationship filter propagation works , the model diagram has been modified to reveal the table rows .
&gt; It &apos;s not possible to display table rows in the Power BI Desktop model diagram . It &apos;s done in this article to support the discussion with clear examples .
The row details for the four tables are described in the following bulleted list :
Let &apos;s see what happens when the model is queried .
- Account-01 balance amount is 75
- Account-02 balance amount is 200
- The total is 275
- Customer-91 balance amount is 275
- Customer-92 balance amount is 275
The * * Customer Balance * * visuals , however , now displays the following result :
- Customer-91 balance amount is 75
The answer to their question lies in understanding the many-to-many relationship . Each customer balance can represent the addition of multiple account balances , and so the customer balances are _ non-additive _ .
When you have a many-to-many relationship between dimension-type tables , we provide the following guidance :
- Add a bridging table to store associated entities
- Create one-to-many relationships between the three tables
- Configure * * one * * bi-directional relationship to allow filter propagation to continue to the fact-type tables
- Hide the bridging table ( unless it contains additional columns or measures required for reporting )
- Hide any ID columns that aren &apos;t suitable for reporting ( for example , when IDs are surrogate keys )
The row details for the two tables are described in the following bulleted list :
Let &apos;s consider a better solution .
Notice the following design changes :
- The four additional tables are all dimension-type tables , and one-to-many relationships relate these tables to the fact-type tables
- All unique identifier columns are hidden
Taking the time to apply star schema design principles delivers the following benefits :
- Your report visuals can _ filter or group _ by any visible column from the dimension-type tables
- Your report visuals can _ summarize _ any visible column from the fact-type tables
This many-to-many scenario is very different from the other two already described in this article .
# # # Relate higher grain time periods
# # # Relate higher grain ( non-date )
A different design approach is required when relating a non-date column from a dimension-type table to a fact-type table ( and it &apos;s at a higher grain than the dimension-type table ) .
Let &apos;s now take a look at the table rows .
The visual produces a misrepresentation of the data . What is happening here ?
To avoid this behavior , as described earlier , we recommend you control the summarization of your fact data by using measures .
The final model design looks like the following .
# # # Relate higher grain facts guidance
When you need to relate a dimension-type table to a fact-type table , and the fact-type table stores rows at a higher grain than the dimension-type table rows , we provide the following guidance :
- For higher grain fact dates :
- In the fact-type table , store the first date of the time period
- Create a one-to-many relationship between the date table and the fact-type table
- For other higher grain facts :
- Create a many-to-many relationship between the dimension-type table and the fact-type table
- Control summarization with measure logic — return BLANK when lower-level dimension-type columns are used to filter or group
- Hide summarizable fact-type table columns — this way , only measures can be used to summarize the fact-type table
title : Change data source connection strings with PowerShell
# Change data source connection strings in Power BI reports with PowerShell - Power BI Report Server
You can change data source connection strings in Power BI reports in Power BI Report Server using APIs in PowerShell .

4 . Save the updated credentials back to the server .
When creating a Premium capacity , administrators are required to define :
- Capacity name ( unique within the tenant ) .
- Capacity admin ( s ) .
At least one Capacity Admin must be assigned . Users assigned as Capacity Admins can :
- Assign workspaces to the capacity .
- Manage user permissions , to add additional Capacity Admins or users with assignment permissions ( to enable them to assign workspaces to the capacity ) .
- Manage workloads , to configure maximum memory usage for paginated reports and dataflows workloads .
- Restart the capacity , to reset all operations because of a system overload .
Power BI service administrators and Global Administrators can modify Premium capacities . Specifically , they can :
- Change the capacity size to scale-up or scale-down resources .
- Add or remove Capacity Admins .
- Add or remove users that have assignment permissions .
- Add or remove additional workloads .
- Change regions .
Assignment permissions are required to assign a workspace to a specific Premium capacity . The permissions can be granted to the entire organization , specific users , or groups .
Deleting a Premium capacity is possible and won &apos;t result in the deletion of its workspaces and content . Instead , it moves any assigned workspaces to shared capacity . When the Premium capacity was created in a different region , the workspace is moved to shared capacity of the home region .
Capacity Admins , as well as Global Administrators or Power BI service administrators , can bulk assign workspaces in the Power BI Admin portal . Bulk assigned can apply to :
A workspace can be added to a Premium capacity by using the * * Workspace * * pane providing the user is both a workspace admin and has assignment permissions .
In the Power BI service , a workspace assigned to a Premium capacity is easily identified by the diamond icon that adorns the workspace name .
# # # Power BI Admin portal
At the capacity level , metrics are cumulative of all enabled workloads. the following metrics are provided :
When the app opens , the dashboard is loaded to present numerous tiles expressing an aggregated view over all capacities of which the user is a Capacity Admin . The dashboard layout includes five main sections :
The underlying report , from which the dashboard tiles were pinned , can be accessed by clicking on any dashboard tile . It provides a more detailed perspective of each of the dashboard sections and supports interactive filtering .
Metrics should be monitored to establish a baseline understanding of resource usage and workload activity . If the capacity becomes slow , it is important to understand which metrics to monitor , and the conclusions you can make .
Ideally , queries should complete within a second to deliver responsive experiences to report users and enable higher query throughput . It is usually of lesser concern when background processes - including refreshes - take longer times to complete .
- Model load times ( especially the wait to load a large model into memory ) .
- Long running queries .
- Complex report designs with an excessive number of visuals on a page ( recall that each visual is a query ) .

# Model relationships in Power BI Desktop
Let &apos;s see how relationships propagate filters with an animated example .
&gt; If a data refresh operation attempts to load duplicate values into a &quot; one &quot; side column , the entire data refresh will fail .
The four options — together with their shorthand notations — are described in the following bulleted list :
&gt; The Many-to-many cardinality type isn &apos;t currently supported for models developed for Power BI Report Server .
# # # Cross filter direction
Each model relationship must be defined with a cross filter direction . Your selection determines the direction ( s ) that filters will propagate . The possible cross filter options are dependent on the cardinality type .
&#124; Cardinality type &#124; Cross filter options &#124;
&#124; One-to-one &#124; Both &#124;
# # # Make this relationship active
# # # Assume referential integrity
There are several DAX functions that are relevant to model relationships . Each function is described briefly in the following bulleted list :
First , some modeling theory is required to fully understand relationship evaluations .
Let &apos;s see an example of a Composite model .
&gt; Inactive relationships are expanded also , even when the relationship isn &apos;t used by a calculation . Bi-directional relationships have no impact on table expansion .
- The relationship uses a Many-to-many cardinality type ( even if one or both columns contain unique values )
- The relationship is cross-island ( which can only ever be the case for Composite models )
For Import models , data structures are never created for weak relationships . This means table joins must be resolved at query time .
There are additional restrictions related to weak relationships :
- The RELATED DAX function can &apos;t be used to retrieve the &quot; one &quot; side column values
- Enforcing RLS has topology restrictions
Bi-directional relationships can introduce multiple — and therefore ambiguous — filter propagation paths between model tables . The following list presents precedence rules that Power BI uses for ambiguity detection and path resolution :
1 . Many-to-one and One-to-one relationships , including weak relationships
2 . Many-to-many relationships
The following list orders filter propagation performance , from fastest to slowest performance :
1 . One-to-many intra-island relationships
2 . Many-to-many cardinality relationships
3 . Many-to-many model relationships achieved with an intermediary table and that involves at least one bi-directional relationship
4 . Cross-island relationships
Using Diagnostics can answer a few scenarios , such as :
* Detection of long-running or problematic queries .
* Tracking usage of specific datasets .
# # Set up diagnostics logging
To change how your diagnostic logs are saved , you can return to this page to modify settings .
To enable metrics and diagnostics logging by using PowerShell , use the following commands :
* To enable storage of diagnostics logs in a storage account , use this command :
The storage account ID is the resource ID for the storage account where you want to send the logs .
* To enable streaming of diagnostics logs to an event hub , use this command :
* The Azure Service Bus rule ID is a string with this format :
* To enable sending diagnostics logs to a Log Analytics workspace , use this command :
* You can obtain the resource ID of your Log Analytics workspace by using the following command :

# Sensitivity labels in Power BI
# # How sensitivity labels work in Power BI
In Microsoft Office applications , a sensitivity label appears as a tag on the email or document , similar to what is shown in the image above .
# # Sensitivity label inheritance upon creation of new content
The following image shows how a dataset &apos;s sensitivity label is automatically applied on a new report that is built on top of the dataset .
# # Sensitivity labels and protection on exported data
A user who exports a file from Power BI has permissions to access and edit that file according to the sensitivity label settings ; they do not get owner permissions to the file .
Sensitivity labels and protection are not applied when data is exported to .csv , .pbix files , or any other export path .
# # Sensitivity label inheritance in Analyze in Excel
&gt; If the dataset &apos;s sensitivity label is less restrictive than the Excel file &apos;s sensitivity label , no label inheritance or update takes place . An Excel file never inherits a less restrictive sensitivity label .
The following embedding scenarios are supported :
# # Sensitivity labels in the Power BI mobile apps
Sensitivity labels are only supported for tenants in global ( public ) clouds ; they are not supported for tenants in clouds such as national clouds .
# # Sensitivity label creation and management

title : Use insights to explain increases and decreases in visuals ( Preview )
The insights feature is contextual , and is based on the immediately previous data point - such as the previous bar , or column .
By selecting the small icons at the bottom of the waterfall visual , you can choose to have insights display a scatter chart , stacked column chart , or a ribbon chart .
You can use insights when your report is in reading or editing mode , making it versatile for both analyzing data , and for creating visuals you can easily add to your reports .
# # Details of the results returned
The details returned by insights are intended to highlight what was different between the two time periods , to help you understand the change between them .
# # # The scatter plot
# # # The 100 % stacked column chart
# # # The waterfall chart
The fourth visual is a waterfall chart , showing the main actual increases or decreases between the periods . This visual clearly shows the actual changes , but does not alone indicate the changes to the level of contribution that actually highlight why the column was chosen as being interesting .
When ranking the column as to which have the largest differences in the relative contributions , the following is considered :
* The cardinality is factored in , as a difference is less statistically significant , and less interesting , when a column has a large cardinality .
* Various heuristics are employed to select the most meaningful results , for example by considering other relationships between the data .
Since these insights are based on the change from the previous data point , they aren &apos;t available when you select the first data point in a visual .
* Include / exclude filters
* Non-numeric measures
* Use of &quot; Show value as &quot;
* Categorical columns on X-axis unless it defines a sort by column that is scalar . If using a hierarchy , then every column in the active hierarchy has to match this condition
In addition , the following model types and data sources are currently not supported for insights :

Images can be stored in three different locations :
- Within the report ( embedded )
- On a web server
- In a database , which can be retrieved by a dataset
They can then be used in a variety of scenarios in your report layouts :
- Free-standing logo , or picture
- Pictures associated with rows of data
- Background for certain report items :
- Report body
Consider the following suggestions to deliver professional report layouts , ease of maintenance , and optimized report performance :
title : Get started with the Power BI mobile app for iOS
You can run the Power BI mobile app for iOS on any device running iOS 11 or later .
# # Sign up for the Power BI service
# # Get started with the Power BI app
1 . In your iOS device , open the Power BI app .
When you &apos;re in the app , just tap the account profile image in the upper left corner of your screen to switch between Power BI and your report server .
Even without signing up , you can view and interact with the Power BI and Reporting Services samples .
A number of Power BI samples are followed by several Report server samples .

You ’ ll be prompted to sign in to Power BI .
When we pin a couple of visuals from our report , we can see them in the dashboard .
# Manage your workspace in Power BI and Microsoft 365
* Add or remove workspace members , including making a workspace member an admin .
* Edit the workspace name .
* Delete the workspace , which also deletes the Microsoft 365 group .
* Add or remove your workspace &apos;s group members , including making a member an owner .
* See the group email address .
* Delete the group .
# # Edit your workspace in Power BI
1 . Here you can rename the workspace , add or remove members , or delete the workspace .
# # Edit Power BI workspace properties in Microsoft 365
You can also edit aspects of a workspace directly in Outlook for Microsoft 365 .
# # # Edit the members of the workspace group
This opens the Outlook for Microsoft 365 group view of your workspace . You may need to sign in to your corporate account .
# # # Add an image and set other workspace properties
Here are some of the most common ways to use parameters .
- Filter paginated report data at the data source by writing dataset queries that contain variables .
* * Vary report presentation * *
- Enable users to specify values to help customize the appearance of a report . For example , provide a Boolean parameter to indicate whether to expand or collapse all nested row groups in a table .
- Enable users to customize report data and appearance by including parameters in an expression .
You can create report parameters in a few different ways .
&gt; Not all data sources support parameters .
* * Dataset query or stored procedure with parameters * *
This image from Report Builder shows :
2 . The dataset with the parameters .
Create a parameter manually from the Report Data pane . You can configure report parameters so that a user can interactively enter values to help customize the contents or appearance of a report . You can also configure report parameters so that a user cannot change preconfigured values .
&gt; Because parameters are managed independently on the server , republishing a main report with new parameter settings doesn &apos;t overwrite the existing parameters settings on the report .
The following are options for selecting parameter values in the report .
- Select a single parameter value from a drop-down list .
- Select multiple parameter values from a drop-down list .
- Run the report without having to first select a parameter value because a default value has been created for the parameter .
&#124; Prompt &#124; The text that appears next to the parameter on the report viewer toolbar . &#124;
&#124; Internal &#124; Select this option to hide the report parameter . In the published report , the report parameter can only be viewed in the report definition . &#124;
To filter data in the dataset query , you can include a restriction clause that limits the retrieved data by specifying values to include or exclude from the result set .
Use the query designer for the data source to help build a parameterized query .
When you design a report , report parameters are saved in the report definition . When you publish a report , report parameters are saved and managed separately from the report definition .
For a published report , you can use the following :
Report execution options can affect how parameters are processed . A report that runs as a snapshot cannot use parameters that are derived from a query unless the query includes default values for the parameters .
You can define a subscription for an on demand or for a snapshot and specify parameter values to use during subscription processing .

# Troubleshoot subreports in Power BI paginated reports
# # Subreport couldn &apos;t be found
- A subreport with the specified name doesn &apos;t exist in the same workspace or app as the main report .
- The user doesn &apos;t have access to the subreport .
- The number of subreports in the main report has reached the subreport limit ( 50 subreports ) .
- Verify that the report with the name in the error message exists . The name is case insensitive .
- Verify that the report with the name in the error message exits in the app . Contact the author of the app for further assistance .
* * If the report is shared * *
1 . Verify that the report with the name in the error message is shared with you .
Power BI allows users to have multiple reports with the same name in the same workspace
2 . Look for reports with the same name in the workspace .
3 . Locate the expected report and rename the rest .
Same as the general troubleshooting steps for reports with data access issues .
# # Rendering fails : Unspecified parameters
3 . Verify that the set of parameters passed inside the subreport report item in the main report matches the set of parameters in the subreport .
# # Rendering fails : Recursion limit
- Reduce nesting .
&quot; Error : Subreport could not be shown . &quot;
- Multiple errors during subreport rendering , for example , parameter mismatch with data retrieval issues .
- Unexpected errors .
1 . Verify that the subreport can render directly .
2 . If the subreport can render , check the parameters in both the subreport and main report .
4 . If you can &apos;t resolve the issue , contact Power BI support .

title : Power BI visuals interactivity utils
# Power BI visuals interactivity utils
Interactivity utils ( `InteractivityUtils` ) is a set of functions and classes that can be used to simplify the implementation of cross-selection and cross-filtering .
1 . To install the package , run the following command in the directory with your current Power BI visual project .
3 . To use interactivity utils , import the required component in the source code of the Power BI visual .
# # # Including the CSS files
To use the package with your Power BI visual , import the following CSS file to your `.less` file .
Import the CSS file as a `.less` file because the Power BI visuals tool wraps external CSS rules .
Usually , data points contain selections and values . The interface extends the `SelectableDataPoint` interface .
`SelectableDataPoint` already contains properties as described below .
# # Defining an interface for data points
1 . Create an instance of interactivity utils and save the object as a property of the visual
2 . Extend the base behavior class .
3 . Define the interface for the behavior class options .
The class is responsible to handle `click` `contextmenu` mouse events .
When a user clicks on data elements , the visual calls the selection handler to select data points. if the user clicks on the background element of the visual , it calls the clear selection handler .
The class has the following correspond methods :
# Scatter charts , bubble charts , and dot plot charts in Power BI
# # # Scatter and bubble charts
Scatter charts are a great choice :
* To show relationships between two numerical values .
* To plot two groups of numbers as one series of x and y coordinates .
* To use instead of a line chart when you want to change the scale of the horizontal axis .
* To turn the horizontal axis into a logarithmic scale .
* To display worksheet data that includes pairs or grouped sets of values .
&gt; In a scatter chart , you can adjust the independent scales of the axes to reveal more information about the grouped values .
In addition to what Scatter charts can do for you , bubble charts are a great choice :
* If your data has three data series that each contains a set of values .
* To present financial data . Different bubble sizes are useful to visually emphasize specific values .
* To use with quadrants .
# # # Dot plot charts
A dot plot chart is similar to a bubble chart and scatter chart , but is instead used to plot categorical data along the X-Axis .
They &apos;re a great choice if you want to include categorical data along the X-Axis .
# # Create a scatter chart
Now let &apos;s add a third dimension .
# # Create a bubble chart
You can set the max data volume to any number up to 10,000 . As you get into the higher numbers , we suggest testing first to ensure good performance .
# # Create a dot plot chart
# # # Your scatter chart has only one data point
Does your scatter chart have only one data point that aggregates all the values on the X- and Y-axes ? Or maybe it aggregates all the values along a single horizontal or vertical line ?
If you don &apos;t have that in your data , create a field that concatenates your X and Y values together into something unique per point :

# Refresh summaries for Power BI
The refresh summaries page has two views :
You can also export information about a refresh event to a .CSV file , which can provide significant information and insight into refresh events or errors that can be impacting the performance or completion of scheduled refresh events .
The following sections look at each of these views in turn .
The History provides an overview of the outcomes of recently scheduled refreshes on the capacities for which you have admin privilege . You can sort the view by any column by clicking the column . You can choose to sort the view by the column selected by ascending order , descending , or by using text filters .
With the information in the exported file , you can review the capacity , duration , and any error messages recorded for the instance of refresh .
There are three scheduled refresh events occurring in this time slot .

title : Personalize visuals in a report
# Personalize visuals in a report
# # What you can change
This feature helps you gain further insights through ad-hoc exploration of visuals on a Power BI report . Here are some of the modifications that you can make . The available options vary by visual type .
- Change the visualization type
- Swap out a measure or dimension
- Compare two or more measures
- Change aggregations , etc .
Not only does this feature allow for new exploration capabilities . It also includes ways for you to capture and share your changes :
- Capture your changes
- Share your changes
- Reset all your changes for a report
- Reset all your changes for a visual
- Clear out your recent changes
# # Personalize visuals in the Power BI service
By personalizing a visual , you can explore your data in many ways , without leaving report reading view . The following examples show different ways you can modify a visualization to meet your needs .
1 . Open a report in reading view in the Power BI service .
# # # Change the visualization type
Replace the field being used for the X axis by selecting the field that you want to replace , then selecting a different field .
# # # Add or remove a legend
By adding a legend , you can color-code a visual based on a category . In this example , we &apos;re color-coding based on company name .
# # # Compare two or more different measures
You can also make the bookmark your default view .
If you have read and reshare permissions , when you share the report you can choose to include your changes .
# # # Reset all your changes to a report
# # # Clear recent changes
Select the eraser icon to clear all recent changes you &apos;ve made since you opened the * * Personalize * * pane .
# # Limitations and known issues
Currently the feature has a few limitations to be aware of .
- User explorations don &apos;t automatically persist . You need to save your view as a personal bookmark to capture your changes .
There are also some known issues that we &apos;re addressing :
- Adding a hierarchy isn &apos;t supported ; you need to add each of the individual child items .
# Support timeline for Power BI Report Server

Use the following tips to help design your paginated reports in Power BI Report Builder .
- A well-designed report conveys information that leads to action . Identify the questions that the report helps to answer . Keep those questions in mind as you design the report .
- Use naming conventions for data sources and datasets that document the source of data .
- Use arrow keys to adjust the position and size of selected items on the design surface . For example , the following key combinations are very useful :
- To add an item to a rectangle , use the upper left tip of the mouse to point to the initial location of the item in the rectangle container . Use keyboard shortcuts to help position selected objects . The rectangle automatically expands to accommodate the size of the contained items .
- To add multiple items to a tablix cell , first add a rectangle , and then add the items .
- To drag fields from the Report Data pane to the Grouping pane , avoid dragging the field across other report items on the design surface because this selects the other items and unselects the tablix data region . Drag the field down the Report Data pane and then across to the Grouping pane .
To help select the object that you want on the report design surface , use the ESC key , the right-click context menu , the Properties pane , and the Grouping pane .
- On some report items , try using the right-click context menu to select the report item or the part of the report item that you want .
- The Properties pane displays properties for the current selection .
- To work with row groups and column groups in a tablix data region , select the group from the Grouping pane .
- You can set format properties and actions on a text box or on placeholder text in the text box . If there is only one line of text , it &apos;s more efficient to set properties on the text box than on the text .
- On the report design surface , report items grow to accommodate the contents from the associated dataset , expression , subreport , or text .
- An item in a report grows to accommodate its data and pushes peer items ( items within the same parent container ) out of the way using the following rules :
- Each item moves down to maintain the minimum space between itself and the items that end above it .
- Each item moves right to maintain the minimum space between itself and the items that end to the left of it . For systems that right-to-left layouts , each item moves left to maintain the minimum space between itself and the items that end to the right of it .
1 . Remove all extra white space between data regions and on the edges of the report .
4 . In column headers , change the text box property WritingMode to use vertical text .
Visuals can now make use of Power BI tooltip support . Power BI tooltips handle the following interactions :
* Show a tooltip .
* Hide a tooltip .
* Move a tooltip .
A tooltip in a sample bar chart is shown in the following image :
The preceding tooltip image illustrates a single bar category and value . You can extend a single tooltip to display multiple values .
`TooltipShowOptions` and `TooltipHideOptions` would in turn define what to display and how to behave in these events .
Because calling these methods involves user events such as mouse moves and touch events , it &apos;s a good idea to create listeners for these events , which would in turn invoke the `TooltipService` members .
Our sample aggregates in a class called `TooltipServiceWrapper` .
The bar chart constructor now has a `TooltipServiceWrapper` member , which is instantiated in the constructor with the host `tooltipService` instance .
The `TooltipServiceWrapper` class holds the `tooltipService` instance , also as the root D3 element of the visual and touch parameters .
The single entry point for this class to register event listeners is the `addTooltip` method .
# # # The addTooltip method
As you can see , `addTooltip` exits with no action if the `tooltipService` is disabled or there &apos;s no real selection .
# # # Call the show method to display a tooltip
The `addTooltip` method next listens to the D3 `mouseover` event , as shown in the following code :
Additional handling can be found in the sample for `mouseout` and `mousemove` events .
# # # Populate the tooltip content by the getTooltipData method
# # # Call the addTooltip method
# # Add report page tooltips
To add report page tooltips support , you &apos;ll find most changes in the * capabilities.json * file .
A sample schema is
* `supportedTypes` : The tooltip configuration that &apos;s supported by the visual and reflected in the fields well .
* `canvas` : Specifies whether the report page tooltips are supported .
An example of sending the selectionId to tooltip display calls is shown in the following code :
# Sorting options for Power BI visuals
This article describes how * sorting * options specify the sorting behavior for Power BI visuals .
The sorting capability requires one of the following parameters .
Custom sorting means that the sorting is managed by the developer in the visual &apos;s code .

title : The Power BI service - basic concepts for consumers
# Basic concepts for the Power BI service consumers
# # Open the Power BI service for the first time
But before we get much further , let &apos;s back up and talk about the building blocks that make up the Power BI service .
# # # Introduction to building blocks
At its most basic :
- Can be used over and over by a report designer to create dashboards and reports
- Can be used to create many different reports
- Visuals from that one dataset can appear on many different dashboards
On to the next building block -- visualizations .
One visualization in a report ...
- Can appear multiple times in the same report
- Can appear on many different dashboards
One report ...
- Can be created using data from only one dataset .
- Can be part of multiple apps .
What are some purposes for dashboards ? Here are just a few :
- to see , in one glance , all the info needed to make decisions
- to monitor the most-important info about your business
- to ensure all colleagues are on the same page ; viewing and using the same info
- to monitor the health of a business or product or business unit or marketing campaign , and so on
- to create a personalized view of a larger dashboard -- all the metrics that matter to you
- can display visualizations from many different datasets
- can display visualizations from many different reports
- can display visualizations pinned from other tools ( for example , Excel )
This app has three related dashboards and three related reports that make up a single app .
You can get apps in a few different ways :
- The app designer can install the app automatically in your Power BI account .
- The app designer can send you a direct link to an app .
Once you &apos;ve installed the app , just select it from your Apps list and select which dashboard or report to open and explore first .
I hope this article gave you an understanding of the building blocks that make up the Power BI service for consumers .
- Watch a video in which Will reviews the basic concepts and gives a tour of the Power BI service .
You were able to connect to the server but not to the database that was supplied . Verify the name of the database and that the user credential has the proper permission to access that database .
You were unable to connect to the specified data source . Be sure to validate the information provided for that data source .
To confirm whether the attribute is enabled , follow these steps .
You want to see something similar to the following in the results :
To correct this issue , you must enable TGGAU on the account used for the Analysis Services Windows service .
This error could also be caused if the Analysis Services server is in a different domain than the users and there isn &apos;t a two-way trust established .
Work with your domain administrators to verify the trust relationship between domains .
# # # Error : There is not enough space for this row .
# # # Error : You don &apos;t see the on-premises data gateway present when you configure scheduled refresh .
A few different scenarios could be responsible for this error :
This error is usually caused by one of the following :
- There &apos;s no data source available on any gateway within your organization . You can configure the data source on a new or existing on-premises data gateway .
3 . Run the following query . You see a rather large JSON response .
The ImpersonationLevel is related to the SPN setup or the local policy setting .
Follow these steps to solve the issue .
1 . Set up an SPN for the on-premises gateway .
2 . Set up constrained delegation in your Active Directory .
The FailedToImpersonateUserException happens if you &apos;re unable to impersonate on behalf of another user . This error could also happen if the account you &apos;re trying to impersonate is from another domain than the one the gateway service domain is on . This is a limitation .
* Verify that the configuration is correct as per the steps in the previous &quot; ImpersonationLevel &quot; section .
* Ensure that the user ID it &apos;s trying to impersonate is a valid Active Directory account .
# # # General error : 1033 error while you parse the protocol
# Troubleshooting sign-in for Power BI Desktop
# # Proxy Authentication Required error
The following screen shows an example of the * Proxy Authentication Required * error .
If your network uses a proxy authentication server , your administrator can fix this issue by adding the following domains to the allow list on the proxy authentication server :
* domains in the * .analysis.windows.net namespace
For customers who are part of a government cloud , fixing this issue can be done by adding the following domains to the allow list on the proxy authentication server :
* domains in the * .analysis.usgovcloudapi.net namespace
* * Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory.AdalServiceException : Non-HTTPS url redirect is not supported in webview *
There may be many trace files in that folder . Make sure you only send the recent files to your administrator to facilitate quickly identifying the error .
# # Using default system credentials for web proxy
It is not necessary to have the registry entry in both locations .
# # # Limitations and considerations for using default system credentials
There are a collection of security implications that administrators should consider before enabling this capability .
The following recommendations should be followed whenever enabling this feature for clients :
# # How are backup instances kept in sync with my data ?
# # Where are the failover clusters located ?
# # How does Microsoft decide to fail over ?
There are two different systems that indicate when a failover might be required :
- Microsoft Azure &apos;s central operations team informs us of a critical outage in a region .
# # How do I know Power BI is now in failover mode ?
# # How long does it take Power BI to fail over ?
# # What happens to workspaces and reports if my Premium capacity becomes unavailable ?
If a Premium capacity becomes unavailable , workspaces and reports remain accessible and visible to all Power BI Pro licensed users who previously had access to them .
# # When does my Power BI instance return to the original region ?
# # Am I responsible for the availability of my Power BI solution ?
If the Power BI solution used in your organization involves one of the following elements , you must take some measures to guarantee that the solution remains highly available :
# # Will gateways function when in failover mode ?
# # Use the link in Power BI Desktop

title : Pin a tile to a Power BI dashboard from a report
# Pin a tile to a Power BI dashboard from a report
You can &apos;t pin tiles from reports that have been shared with you or from Power BI Desktop .
&gt; Because some visualizations use background images , pinning might not work if the background image is too large . Try reducing the image size or using image compression .
# # Pin a tile from a report
Watch Amanda create a dashboard by pinning visuals and images from a Power BI report .
Now create your own dashboard by using one of the Power BI sample reports .
2 . Select whether to pin to an existing dashboard or new dashboard .
# # Pin an entire report page

# Manage your data source - SQL Server
# # Add a data source
# # Use the data source
After you create the data source , it &apos;s available to use with either DirectQuery connections or through scheduled refresh .
&gt; The server and database names must match between Power BI Desktop and the data source within the on-premises data gateway .
This requirement is the case for both DirectQuery and scheduled refresh .

title : Change how visuals interact in a report
# Change how visuals interact in a Power BI report
# # Introduction to visual interactions
By default , visualizations on a report page can be used to cross-filter and cross-highlight the other visualizations on the page .
For example , selecting a state on a map visualization highlights the column chart and filters the line chart to display only data that applies to that one state .
# # Enable the visual interaction controls
If you have edit permissions to a report , you can turn on the visual interaction controls and then customize how the visualizations on your report page filter and highlight each other .
1 . Select a visualization to make it active .
- In the Power BI service , open the report in Editing view and select the dropdown from the report menu bar .
# # Change the interaction behavior
If the selected visualization should :
# # Change the interactions of drillable visualizations
1 . Select the drillable visual to make it active .
2 . Turn on drill down by selecting the drill down icon .
If you build a matrix with fields from different tables , then try to cross-highlight by selecting multiple items at different levels of the hierarchy , you get errors on the other visuals .

title : Use bookmarks in Power BI Desktop to share insights and build stories
You can also create a collection of bookmarks , arrange them in the order you want , and later step through each bookmark in a presentation to highlight a series of insights , or the story you want to tell with your visuals and reports .
When you create a bookmark , the following elements are saved with the bookmark :
* The current page
* Slicers , including slicer type ( for example , dropdown or list ) and slicer state
* Visual selection state ( such as cross-highlight filters )
* Drill location
The yellow bar between bookmarks designates where the dragged bookmark will be placed .
# # Bookmarks as a slide show
1 . The name of the bookmark appears in the bookmark title bar , which appears at the bottom of the canvas .
2 . The bookmark title bar has arrows that let you move to the next or previous bookmark .
# # Visibility : Using the Selection pane
# # Bookmarks for shapes and images
To assign a bookmark to an object :
To create a bookmark group :
As with any bookmark group , expanding the bookmark group &apos;s name only expands or collapses the group of bookmarks , and doesn &apos;t represent a bookmark by itself .
To ungroup bookmarks :
1 . Select any bookmark in a group and select the ellipsis .
To remove a single bookmark from a group :
Let &apos;s compare spotlight to focus mode to see how they differ :

To enable the preview bookmarks feature :
In this release of the bookmarks features , there are a few limitations and considerations to keep in mind .
* Moving a visual after a bookmark has been created is automatically reflected in the bookmark .
For more information about features that are similar or interact with bookmarks , see the following articles :
By default , relationships will be set to cross-filter in both directions . Cross-filtering in just one direction limited some of the modeling capabilities in a relationship .
Setting accurate relationships between your data allows you to create complex calculations across multiple data elements .

title : How to configure workloads in Power BI Premium
# Configure workloads in a Premium capacity
# # # AI ( Preview )
The AI workload lets you use cognitive services and Automated Machine Learning in Power BI . Use the following settings to control workload behavior .
&#124; Setting Name &#124; Description &#124;
The datasets workload is enabled by default and cannot be disabled . Use the following settings to control workload behavior . There is additional usage information below the table for some of the settings .
Alternatively , if the capacity can support more than the one million row default , and you have a large dataset , increase this setting to fetch more rows .
# # # # Max Offline Dataset Size
# # # # Max Result Row Set Count
Use this setting to control the impact of resource-intensive or poorly designed reports . If this limit is reached in a DAX query , a report user sees the following error . They should copy the error details and contact an administrator .
# # # # Query Memory Limit
This setting applies to all DAX and MDX queries that are executed by Power BI reports , Analyze in Excel reports , as well as other tools which might connect over the XMLA endpoint .
The default setting is 0 , which results in the following SKU-specific automatic query memory limit being applied .
Use this setting to maintain better control of long-running queries , which can cause reports to load slowly for users .
This setting applies to a single query and not the length of time it takes to run all of the queries associated with updating a dataset or report . Consider the following example :
- There are five queries to execute , and each runs 15 minutes .
- Turn automatic page refresh on and off
- Define a minimum refresh interval
The following image shows the location of the automatic refresh interval setting :
Queries created by automatic page refresh go directly to the data source , so it &apos;s important to consider reliability and load on those sources when allowing automatic page refresh in your organization .
# # # # Enhanced dataflows compute engine
- Dataflow entities include computation steps , for example , a join .
Maximize your capacity &apos;s available resources by enabling workloads only if they will be used . Change memory and other settings only when you have determined default settings are not meeting your capacity resource requirements .

title : Upgrade classic workspaces to the new workspaces
# Upgrade classic workspaces to the new workspaces in Power BI
&gt; Workspace upgrade is available as a Public Preview .
# # Things to do after upgrading
# # Upgrade a classic workspace
# # # Impact on other workspace users
Users who are actively using the workspace are asked to refresh their browser . Users who are editing a report are given the option to save before they refresh .
# # # Differences in roles before and after upgrade
Workspace roles are different in the classic and new workspaces . The new workspace experience enables you to give workspace roles to Microsoft 365 groups , security groups , or distribution lists .
Any users who have access to items in the workspace through sharing or app permission continue to have access to those items . Anyone with access to the workspace also has access to the app published from the workspace . These users aren &apos;t listed in the app access list .
After upgrade , you may consider creating a security or Microsoft 365 group or distribution list for workspace admins , instead of managing access through role assignments to individual users .
Users in the Admin , Member , or Contributor workspace roles need a Power BI Pro license to access the workspace .
The new workspace experience has features that the classic workspaces don &apos;t have . One difference is the ability to set a contact list that &apos;s different from the workspace admins or owners . One similarity is that it &apos;s still connected to the Microsoft 365 group SharePoint document library .
# # # Modify the contact list
# # # The workspace OneDrive
# # Content packs during upgrade
# # # Published content packs
# # # Installed content packs
However , there are important changes :
- The content no longer updates if the content pack is updated .
- The URLs and item identifiers change and require any bookmarks or links you &apos;ve shared with others to be updated .
- New users may not have access to the datasets that were in the content pack . You need work with the dataset owner to ensure workspace users have access to the data .
# # Go back to a classic workspace
To go back , you need to be an Owner of the Microsoft 365 group the workspace was associated with before it was upgraded . Follow these steps .
1 . When the switch back is complete , you see a confirmation dialog box .
You can &apos;t switch back if any of the following statements about your workspace are true :
- The Microsoft 365 group was deleted .
- It &apos;s been more than 30 days since you upgraded .
- The workspace is part of an application life-cycle management pipeline .
- The workspace is used for template apps .
- The workspace uses the large models capability .
- The workspace uses the new usage metrics feature .
When you switch back to a classic workspace , you aren &apos;t restoring an exact copy of the original workspace . The following changes occur :
- Permissions for the workspace are set by the Microsoft 365 group the upgraded workspace was originally connected to .
- Any admins of the Microsoft 365 group become admins of the classic workspace .
- Users who received access to the app for the workspace continue to have access to the app .
- Users who received access to items in the workspace through sharing continue to have access to them .
- Content packs published from the classic workspace before upgrade aren &apos;t restored .
- Content packs installed in the classic workspace before upgrade aren &apos;t restored .
- Subscriptions created by users in the workspace after upgrade are removed . Subscriptions that existed before upgrade continue to work as expected .
- Data alerts aren &apos;t preserved . They &apos;re removed .
- If you renamed the workspace after upgrade , the name of the workspace is restored to match the name of the Microsoft 365 group .
- In-progress operations like refreshes aren &apos;t impacted by workspace upgrade .
# # Manage migration to the new workspaces for your tenant
- After upgrading users may see a &quot; Failure to load model &quot; warning dialog . This message is shown erroneously and can be ignored .
# Create and use doughnut charts in Power BI
A doughnut chart is similar to a pie chart in that it shows the relationship of parts to a whole . The only difference is that the center is blank and allows space for a label or icon .
# # Create a doughnut chart
* The sum of the doughnut chart values must add up to 100 % .
* Too many categories make it difficult to read and interpret .
* Doughnut charts are best used to compare a particular section to the whole , rather than comparing individual sections with each other .

You can also embed that iframe link into a blog post or website , or into Sway , too .
# Manage storage mode in Power BI Desktop
The storage mode setting in Power BI Desktop is one of three related features :
# # Use the Storage mode property
To set the * * Storage mode * * property , or view its current setting :
You set the * * Storage mode * * property to one of these three values :
# # Constraints on DirectQuery and Dual tables
# # Propagation of the Dual setting
The propagation logic traverses only to the one side of one-to-many relationships .
Let &apos;s continue with the example from the previous section , and imagine applying the following storage mode property settings :
* Data-refresh times are improved , and memory consumption is reduced .
# # Queries that hit or miss the cache
* Queries Events \ Query Begin
* Query Processing \ Vertipaq SE Query Begin
* Query Processing \ DirectQuery Begin
# # Caches should be kept in sync
There are a few limitations for this release of storage mode and its correlation with composite models .
The following live connection ( multi-dimensional ) sources can &apos;t be used with composite models :
When you connect to those multi-dimensional sources by using DirectQuery , you can &apos;t connect to another DirectQuery source or combine it with imported data .
For more information about composite models and DirectQuery , see the following articles :

# # # All / some of the visuals in the report don &apos;t contain any value
The barcode value you scanned exists in your model but all / Some of the visuals on your report don &apos;t contain this value and therefore filtering will return an empty state . Try looking into other report pages or edit your reports in Power BI desktop to contain this value
title : Manage multi-tenancy with Power BI embedded analytics
# Manage multi-tenancy with Power BI embedded analytics
With Power BI Embedded , there are two main fundamental approaches to maintaining separation between tenants .
This article describes the different approaches and analyzes them according to several evaluation criteria .
* Import - which is the most common way to get data .
* DirectQuery - connect directly to the data in its source repository .
The following are a set of areas to consider when choosing between the different tenancy models .
* Number of users .
* Number of concurrent users in peak times .
# # # Automation &amp; operational complexity
Identify frequently occurring processes that need automation .
* What is the frequency of onboarding new tenants ? What actions are needed to fully onboard each one ?
* What is the release cadence for new or updated Power BI content , that needs to be deployed ?
* How many row-level security roles are defined for each tenant ?
Identifying these processes and how you address them can help you understand the operational complexity involved in maintaining each model .
# # # Data Residency Requirements and the need to support multiple geographies
# # # Content customization and authoring
There are two approaches to SaaS applications that give users the ability to edit and create reports or upload data into the service as part of the flow :
There are two main approaches to manage tenant &apos;s data .
* A separate database per tenant
* A single multi-tenant database
* Adding a new tenant ( customer )
* Updating a report or dashboard for some or all the tenants
* Updating the dataset schema for some or all the tenants
* Unplanned customizations for specific tenants
* Frequency of dataset refreshes
Application developers need to consider the limit on the number of parallel refreshes , as refresh processes might need extra capacity when you have multiple datasets .
If the application developer needs to manage many roles and role definitions that need to be created or updated frequently , row-level security-based isolation isn &apos;t scalable , from a manageability perspective .
Another operational complexity is the need to closely monitor memory utilization and build a robust mechanism of alerts and scaling to ensure users get a smooth experience .
# # Summary comparison of the different approaches
* The number of datasets in a single workspace is 1000 .
* The number of reports / dashboards connected to a single dataset is 1000 .
* The max dataset size in a dedicated capacity is 10 GB .
# # # Measure RLS impact
The following rule expression is defined :
The model comprises four tables :
Each of the three model relationships is described in the following table :
There are several advantages associated with avoiding RLS :
However , there are disadvantages associated with avoiding RLS :
If RLS produces unexpected results , check for the following issues :
- Incorrect relationships exist between model tables , in terms of column mappings and filter directions .
- Tables contain no data .
- Incorrect values are loaded into tables .
- The user is mapped to multiple roles .
- The report is opened in an app .

title : Use report page drillthrough
It &apos;s recommended that you design your report to allow report users to achieve the following flow :
1 . View a report page .
2 . Identify a visual element to analyze more deeply .
3 . Right-click the visual element to drillthrough .
4 . Perform complimentary analysis .
5 . Return to the source report page .
We suggest that you consider two types of drillthrough scenarios :
When your report page displays summarized results , a drillthrough page can lead report users to transaction-level details . This design approach allows them to view supporting transactions , and only when needed .
The following example shows what happens when a report user drills through from a monthly sales summary . The drillthrough page contains a detailed list of orders for a specific month .
A drillthrough page can achieve the opposite of additional depth . This scenario is great for drilling through to a holistic view .
At report design time , we recommend the following practices :
To complete the steps in this article , you need the following resources :
# # Launch Power BI Desktop

# Render events in Power BI visuals
When rendering starts , the Power BI visual code calls the `renderingStarted` method to indicate that the rendering process has started .
# # # Sample : The visual displays no animations
# # # Sample : The visual displays animations
If the visual has animations or async functions for rendering , the `renderingFinished` method should be called after the animation or inside async function .
# # Rendering events for visual certification
# Create key performance indicator ( KPI ) visualizations
# # When to use a KPI
KPIs are a great choice :
* To measure progress . Answers the question , &quot; What am I ahead or behind on ? &quot;
# # How to create a KPI
In this example , you &apos;ll create a KPI that measures the progress you &apos;ve made toward a sales goal .

# # The Basic Filter API
Basic filter interface is shown in the following code :
Example of a basic filter :
The SQL equivalent is :
To create a filter , you can use the BasicFilter class in `powerbi-models` .
# # The Advanced Filter API
The filter was introduced in Visuals API 1.7.0 .
Additionally , the filter uses conditions instead of values with the interface :
The filter interface is shown in the following code :
* `target` is an array of columns with table names :
The filter can address columns from various tables .
* `values` is an array of value tuples , and each tuple represents one permitted combination of the target column values .
Complete example :
&gt; The order of the column names and condition values is sensitive .

- Query refresh reliability
The notification email provides information about the reason for the high resource usage , including the following :
* Dataset ID of the responsible dataset
* CPU time associated with the high resource usage
If you have more than one Premium capacity , the email includes information about those capacities during the overloaded period , so you can consider moving the workspaces containing resource intensive items to capacities with the least load .
Overload email notifications are only sent when an overload threshold is triggered . You will not receive a second email when the load on that Premium capacity returns to non-overloaded levels .

With DAX , there are many functions available to shape , form , or otherwise analyze your data . These functions can be grouped into a handful of categories :
Now that we know how to get that DAX formula started , let &apos;s take a look at each of these function categories in turn .
These functions work only on numeric columns , and generally can aggregate only one column at a time .
These functions count different elements , such as distinct values , non-empty values , and table rows .
While these functions can be situationally useful , there is value in knowing the data type of your columns ahead of time , rather than depending on these functions to provide the data type .

# # # Power Apps visual
Report designers can create a Power App and embed it into a Power BI report as a visual . Consumers can interact with that visual within the Power BI report .
# # # Q &amp; A visual
# # # R script visuals
&gt; Too many data points on a visual can bog it down , so a sophisticated sampling algorithm is used to ensure the accuracy of the visualization .
&gt; Work well with quantitative comparisons among items where there are many categories .
&gt; Are charts of colored rectangles , with size representing value . They can be hierarchical , with rectangles nested within the main rectangles .
&gt; Waterfall charts show a running total as values are added or subtracted .
# # Tell Q &amp; A which visualization to use

# Tables in Power BI reports and dashboards
Create tables in reports and cross-highlight elements within the table with other visuals on the same report page . You can select rows , columns , and even individual cells and cross-highlight . You can also copy and paste individual cells and multiple cell selections into other applications .
Tables are a great choice :
* To see and compare detailed data and exact values ( instead of visual representations ) .
* To display data in a tabular format .
* To display numerical data by categories .
You &apos;ll create the table pictured at the beginning of the article to display sales values by item category .
Power BI automatically creates a table that lists all the categories .
* Try formatting the table grid . Here you &apos;ll add a blue vertical grid , add space to the rows , and increase the outline and text size .
* For the column headers , change the background color , add an outline , and increase the font size .
* After some additional formatting , here is our final table .
Data bars replace the numerical values in the table , making it easier to scan .
# # Copy values from Power BI tables for use in other applications
To copy the value of a single cell :
1 . Select the cell you want to copy .
1 . Right-click inside the cell .
With the unformatted cell value on your clipboard , you can paste it into another application .
To copy more than a single cell :
1 . Right-click inside one of the cells you selected .
* If the text data in your table &apos;s cells or headers contain new line characters , those characters will be ignored unless you toggle on the &apos; Word Wrap &apos; option in the element &apos;s associated formatting pane card .

title : Key influencers visualizations tutorial
The key influencers visual is a great choice if you want to :
- See which factors affect the metric being analyzed .
- Contrast the relative importance of these factors . For example , do short-term contracts have more impact on churn than long-term contracts ?
# # Features of the key influencers visual
# # Analyze a metric that is categorical
- Role in Org
Later in the tutorial , you look at more complex examples that have one-to-many relationships . In those cases , the columns have to first be aggregated down to the customer level before you can run the analysis .
# # Interpret categorical key influencers
Let &apos;s take a look at the key influencers for low ratings .
# # # Top single factor that influences the likelihood of a low rating
- 14.93 % of consumers give a low score .
- On average , all other roles give a low score 5.78 % of the time .
- Consumers are 2.57 times more likely to give a low score compared to all other roles . You can determine this by dividing the green bar by the red dotted line .
# # # Second single factor that influences the likelihood of a low rating
# # Interact with other visuals
# # Interpret continuous key influencers
# # Binned continuous key influencers
In some cases you may find that your continuous factors were automatically turned into categorical ones . This is because we realized the relationship between the variables is not linear and so we cannot describe the relationship as simply increasing or decreasing ( like we did in the example above ) .
# # Interpret measures and aggregates as key influencers
You can use measures and aggregates as explanatory factors inside your analysis . For example , you might want to see what effect the count of customer support tickets or the average duration of an open ticket has on the score you receive .
# # Interpret the results : Top segments
You can turn counts on through the * * Analysis card * * of the formatting pane .
# # Analyze a metric that is numeric
Instead we may want to ask , ‘ What influences House Price to increase ’ ? which allows us to treat house prices as a range rather than distinct values .
In the example below we look at our top influencer which is kitchen quality being Excellent . The results are very similar to the ones we saw when we were analyzing categorical metrics with a few important differences :
In the example below we are looking at the impact a continuous factor ( year house was remodeled ) has on house price . The differences compared to how we analyze continuous influencers for categorical metrics are as follows :
- The scatter plot in the right pane plots the average house price for each distinct value of year remodeled .
Finally , in the case of measures we are looking at the average year a house was built . The analysis here is as follows :
- The scatterplot in the right pane plots the average house price for each distinct value in the table
# # Interpret the results : Top Segments
# # Analyze a metric that is a measure or a summarized column
If you would like to learn more about how you can analyze measures with the key influencers visualization please watch the following tutorial .
The key influencers visual has some limitations :
- Direct Query is not supported
- Publish to web is not supported
- SharePoint Online embedding isn &apos;t supported
This error occurs when you included fields in * * Explain by * * but no influencers were found .
- Your explanatory factors have enough observations to generalize , but the visualization didn &apos;t find any meaningful correlations to report .
When analyzing a numeric or categorical column , the analysis always runs at the table level . For example , if you are analyzing house prices and your table contains an ID column , the analysis will automatically run at the house ID level .
If you have a related table that &apos;s defined at a more granular level than the table that contains your metric , you see this error . Here &apos;s an example :
- You analyze what drives customers to give low ratings of your service .
- You want to see if the device on which the customer is consuming your service influences the reviews they give .
- A customer can consume the service in multiple different ways .
If you try to use the device column as an explanatory factor , you see the following error :
- You can pivot the device column to see if consuming the service on a specific device influences a customer ’ s rating .
Measures and aggregates are by default analyzed at the table level . If there were a measure for average monthly spending , it would be analyzed at the customer table level .
* * How do you calculate key influencers for categorical analysis ? * *
* * How do you calculate key influencers for numeric analysis ? * *
For example , if we are analyzing house prices , a linear regression will look at the impact having an excellent kitchen will have on the house price . Do houses with excellent kitchens generally have lower or higher house prices compared to houses without excellent kitchens ?
- By itself , more bedrooms might be a driver for house prices to be high .
- Including house size in the analysis means you now look at what happens to bedrooms while house size remains constant .
- If house size is fixed at 1,500 square feet , it &apos;s unlikely that a continuous increase in the number of bedrooms will dramatically increase the house price .
- Bedrooms might not be as important of a factor as it was before house size was considered .

# Use the Google Analytics connector for Power BI Desktop
Calculated tables are a function within DAX that allows you to express a whole range of new modeling capabilities . For example , if you want to do different types of merge joins or create new tables on the fly based on the results of a functional formula , calculated tables are the way to accomplish that .
Select * * New Table * * from the Modeling tab to open the formula bar .
Type the name of your new table on the left side of the equal sign , and the calculation that you want to use to form that table on the right . When you &apos;re finished your calculation , the new table appears in the Fields pane in your model .
Once created , you can use your calculated table as you would any other table in relationships , formulas , and reports .

title : &quot; DAX : Appropriate use of error functions &quot;
# DAX : Appropriate use of error functions
As a data modeler , when you write a DAX expression that might raise an evaluation-time error , you can consider using two helpful DAX functions .
However , while these functions can be helpful and can contribute to writing easy-to-understand expressions , they can also significantly degrade the performance of calculations . It can happen because these functions increase the number of storage engine scans required .
Most evaluation-time errors are due to unexpected BLANKs or zero values , or invalid data type conversion .
It &apos;s better to avoid using the ISERROR and IFERROR functions . Instead , apply defensive strategies when developing the model and writing expressions . Strategies can include :
The following measure expression tests whether an error would be raised . It returns BLANK in this instance ( which is the case when you do not provide the IF function with a value-if-false expression ) .
This next version of the measure expression has been improved by using the IFERROR function in place of the IF and ISERROR functions .
However , this final version of the measure expression achieves the same outcome , yet more efficiently and elegantly .

If you have access to the dataset that is being used to create the map visualization , there are a few things you can do to increase the likelihood of correct geo-coding .
# # In Power BI : tips to get better results when using map visualizations
# # Use geo-hierarchies so you can drill down to different &quot; levels &quot; of location
When drilling with geo-hierarchies , it is important to know how each drill button works and what gets sent to Bing Maps .
1 . Go to the Azure SQL database for which you &apos;re configuring refresh .
# Data types in Power BI Desktop
# # Determine and specify a column ’ s data type
In Power BI Desktop , you can determine and specify a column ’ s data type in the Query Editor , or in Data View or Report View :
* * Data types in Query Editor * *
* * Data types in Data View or Report View * *
# # # Date / time types
# # # Blanks / nulls type
# # # Binary data type
# # # Table data type
# # Implicit and explicit data type conversion in DAX formulas
* You can type a date as a string , and DAX will parse the string and attempt to cast it as one of the Windows date and time formats .
For example , if a date is used in a subtraction operation with any other data type , both values are converted to dates , and the return value is also a date .
In the following table , the row header is the numerator and the column header is the denominator .
For example , if an integer is combined with a currency value in a division operation , both values are converted to real numbers , and the result is also a real number .
The following DAX expressions illustrate this behavior :
Conversions are performed implicitly for numeric or date / time types as described in the following table :
# # # Handling blanks , empty strings , and zero values
How blanks are handled in operations such as addition or concatenation depends on the individual function . The following table summarizes the differences between DAX and Microsoft Excel formulas , in the way that blanks are handled .

title : Create a matrix visual in Power BI
# Create matrix visualizations in Power BI
There are many features associated with the matrix , and we &apos;ll go through them in the following sections of this article .
# # Understanding how Power BI calculates totals
Take a look at the following matrix visuals .
# # Expanding and collapsing row headers
Once the icons are turned on , they work similar to PivotTable icons in Excel .
# # Using drill down with the matrix visual
# # # Drill down on row headers
In addition to using those icons , you can select any of those row headers and drill down by choosing from the menu that appears .
# # # Drill down on column headers
&gt; The drill down and drill up icons in the upper-left of the matrix visual only apply to rows . In order to drill down on columns , you must use the right-click menu .
# # Stepped layout with matrix visuals
The matrix visual automatically indents subcategories in a hierarchy beneath each parent , called a stepped layout .
If you turn off stepped layout , Power BI shows the subcategories in another column rather than indented beneath the parent category .
# # Subtotals and grand totals with matrix visuals
The same process applies for column subtotals .
Add visual cues to your table or matrix with * conditional icons * .
# # Cross-highlighting with matrix visuals
# # Copying values from Power BI for use in other applications
* To copy more than a single cell , select a range of cells or use CTRL to select one or more cells .
* The copy will include the column and row headers .
* The copy will be another matrix visualization , but contain only your copied data .
# # Setting a matrix value as a custom URL
# # Shading and font colors with matrix visuals
* If the text data in your matrix &apos;s cells or headers contain new line characters , those characters will be ignored unless you toggle on the &apos; Word Wrap &apos; option in the element &apos;s associated formatting pane card .

title : Use the numeric range slicer in Power BI
# Use the numeric range slicer in Power BI
In this video , Will walks through creating a numeric range slicer .
Select the down-arrow in the upper-right corner of the numeric range slicer and a menu appears .
For the numeric range , you can select from the following three options :
* * * Less than or equal to * *
* * * Greater than or equal to * *
# # Snap to whole numbers with the numeric range slicer
# # Display formatting with the date range slicer
Displaying the Short Date format in the slicer ensures the length of the string stays consistent and compact within the slicer .
The following limitations and considerations apply to the numeric range slicer :
* It doesn &apos;t currently work with measures .
* You can type any number into a numeric slicer , even if it is outside the range of values in the underlying column . This option lets you set up filters if you know the data may change in future .
title : Add hyperlinks ( URLs ) to a table or matrix
&gt; You can &apos;t create a column in DirectQuery mode . But if your data already contains URLs , you can turn them into hyperlinks .
2 . In Data view or Report view , select the column .
# # Create a table or matrix with a hyperlink
2 . Create a table or matrix with the field that you categorized as a Web URL . The hyperlinks are blue and underlined .
# # Display a hyperlink icon instead of a URL
&gt; You can &apos;t display icons in a matrix .
2 . Select the table to make it active .
# # Format link text as a hyperlink
&gt; You can &apos;t format another field as the hyperlink in a matrix .
2 . In Data view or Report view , select the column that contains the URL .
2 . In Report view , create a table or matrix with the URL column and the column you &apos;re going to format as link text .
Now the text in that column is formatted as the link .
4 . Place your cursor in the column that contains the URLs that you &apos;d like to turn into hyperlinks in Power BI tables .

# Use report themes in Power BI Desktop
There are two types of report themes : built-in report themes and custom report theme files .
Let &apos;s discuss how report themes work , then jump into how to create customized report themes .
# # How report themes work
To apply a report theme to a Power BI Desktop report , you can select from the following options :
* Customize a theme , using the * * Customize theme * * dialog
# # # Built-in report themes
To select from the available built-in report themes :
2 . Select from among the included themes from the drop-down menu that appears .
Your report theme is now applied to the report .
The following table shows the available built-in report themes .
&#124; Built-in report theme &#124; Default color sequence &#124;
From the gallery , you can select a theme you like and download its associated JSON file .
When successful , Power BI shows a dialog that the import was successful .
The two ways to customize report themes are the following :
Let &apos;s take a look at each of these approaches , in turn , in the following sections .
# # # Import custom report theme files
You can also import a custom report theme file , by taking the following steps :
A window appears that lets you browse to the location of the JSON theme file .
When the theme file has loaded successfully , Power BI Desktop displays a success message .
# # Introduction to report theme JSON files
This report theme JSON file has the following lines :
You can use this JSON file as a basis to create your own custom report theme file to import . If you want to adjust only the basic colors of your report , change the name and hex codes in the file .
# # How report theme colors stick with your reports
To view the available colors in a report theme :
# # # Situations when report theme colors won &apos;t stick to your reports
Many Power BI visuals won &apos;t apply to report themes .
# # Custom report theme files you can use right now
- Valentine &apos;s Day theme .
Here &apos;s the code for the Valentine &apos;s Day JSON file :
Here are a few more report themes you can use as starting points :
Report themes can make your Power BI Desktop reports a colorful reflection of you , your organization , or even the current season or holiday .
To export the currently applied theme from Power BI Desktop :
# # Report theme JSON file format
# # # Setting theme colors
A basic theme that defines these colors might appear as follows :
&#124; Color class &#124; What it formats &#124;
Here &apos;s a sample theme that sets the color classes :
# # # Setting formatted text defaults
The following table shows the following information :
- Each of the four primary text classes , what it formats , and its default settings
- Each secondary class , what it formats , and its default setting that &apos;s unique compared to the primary class
* \ * Starred items are also colored based on the first data color of the report theme . *
Here &apos;s an example theme that sets only the primary text classes :
This example makes the following settings :
- Turns on word wrap everywhere
- Sets the gridline style to dotted for all visuals with a category axis
- Sets the bubble size for scatter charts to -10 .
&gt; You need only specify the formatting elements you want to adjust . Any formatting elements that aren &apos;t included in the JSON file revert to their default values and settings .
# # # `visualStyles` definition list
# # # Properties within each card
# # # Enumerations in the JSON file
The following section defines the enumerations that you can use in the JSON file .
Built-in themes that are affected by this limitation include the following themes :
* Colorblind safe
* High contrast
If you &apos;re using one of the affected themes and you don &apos;t need to modify the text settings , you can safely use the other tabs of the dialog box with no issues . However , if you want to use the text classes with one of the affected themes , you have a couple options :
- The quickest and easiest way to enable the text classes is to select the Default theme options .
- If you want to keep your current custom theme , to enable the text tab :
1 . Export your current theme .
1 . Select the default theme .
1 . Import the custom theme you exported in the first step .
The text in your report will look different , but you will be able to access the text tab in the theme dialog box .

title : Monitor usage metrics in the new workspace experience ( preview )
# Monitor usage metrics in the new workspace experience ( preview )
- To access improved usage metrics for a report , the report must reside in a modern workspace and you must have edit access to that report .
# # Create &amp; view an improved usage metrics report
1 . Open the workspace that contains the report for which you want to analyze the usage metrics .
&gt; You can only see the New usage report switch if your report resides in a modern workspace . Legacy workspaces do not offer improved usage metrics reports .
# # About the improved usage metrics report
# # # Usage metrics report dataset
&gt; While still in preview , the usage metrics dataset may have minor changes which affect custom reports .
The improved usage metrics report includes the following report pages :
# # # Which metrics are reported ?
&#124; Report usage &#124; Report views per day &#124; Total number of views per day . &#124;
&#124; Report usage &#124; Users with report views &#124; Shows the list of users who opened the report sorted by view count . &#124;
# # Update usage metrics report credentials
Use the following procedure to take over a Usage Metrics Report dataset and update the credentials .
1 . Open the workspace that contains the report for which you want to update the Usage Metrics Report dataset .
1 . Select the Usage Metrics Report dataset .
If you aren &apos;t the current dataset owner , you must take over ownership before you can update the data source credentials .
1 . Complete the sign-in sequence and note the notification that the data source was updated successfully .
# # Disable usage metrics reports
&gt; Only admins for the Power BI tenant can see the Admin portal and edit settings .
# # Exclude user information from usage metrics reports
If user information is excluded , the usage report refers to users as Unnamed .
# # Customize the usage metrics report
To dig into the report data , or to build your own reports against the underlying dataset , you have several options :
# # # Create a copy of the usage report
For example , you can change filters , add new pages , and build new visualizations , format the fonts and colors , etc .
1 . The new report is saved to the Reports tab in the current workspace and added to the Recent content list .
1 . Now you can create and share custom usage reports , all from the same Usage Metrics Report dataset .
# # # Analyze usage data in Excel
In addition to the above differences between previous and improved usage metrics reports , note the following limitations for the preview release :
- Dashboard usage metrics still rely on the previous version of the usage metrics reports .
- Improved usage metrics reports are only available for reports in modern workspaces . Reports in legacy workspaces only support the previous version of the usage metrics reports .
- Initializing the Usage Metrics Report dataset might fail due to a timeout encountered during refresh . Refer to the Troubleshooting section below to resolve this issue .
- In some scenarios you may notice the performance data is missing . This can occur if a user opens a report and interacts with the report before it has completed loading or if an error occured during the report load .
In addition to the above considerations and limitations , the following questions and answers about usage metrics might be helpful for users and administrators :
Note that the definition of a view differs from previous usage metrics reports . Changing report pages is no longer considered an additional view .
# # Troubleshoot : Delete the dataset
If you suspect data consistency or refresh issues , it might make sense to delete the existing Usage Metrics Report dataset . Then you can run View Usage Metrics again to generate a new dataset with its associated improved usage metrics reports . Follow these steps .
# # # Delete the dataset
1 . Open the workspace that contains the report for which you want to reset the Usage Metrics Report dataset .
5 . Copy the workspace and dataset IDs from the URL displayed in the address bar of your browser .
# # # Create a fresh usage metrics report
1 . Back in the Power BI service , you see the dataset is gone .
2 . If you still see the Usage Metrics report in the Reports list , refresh your browser .
# Enable encryption for SAP HANA
Ensure your HANA server is configured to use OpenSSL as its cryptographic provider . Replace the missing path information below with the server ID ( sid ) of your HANA server .
Create an X509 certificate signing request for the HANA server .
1 . Execute the following command :
Get the certificate signed by a certificate authority ( CA ) that is trusted by the client ( s ) you &apos;ll use to connect to the HANA server .
1 . Restart the HANA server .
1 . Verify the trust relationship between a client and the CA you used to sign the SAP HANA server &apos;s certificate .
The client must trust the CA used to sign the HANA server &apos;s X509 certificate before an encrypted connection can be made to the HANA server from the client &apos;s machine .
You must first convert trust.pem into a .crt file before you can import the certificate into the Trusted Root Certification Authorities folder , for example by executing the following OpenSSL command :

title : &quot; Bi-directional relationship guidance &quot;
Generally , we recommend minimizing the use of bi-directional relationships . They can negatively impact on model query performance , and possibly deliver confusing experiences for your report users .
There are three scenarios when bi-directional filtering can solve specific requirements :
Bi-directional relationships play an important role when creating the following two special model relationship types :
To help describe how bi-directional filtering works , the model diagram has been modified to reveal the table rows . All examples in this article are based on this data .
The row details for the three tables are described in the following bulleted list :
Now consider the following report page .
We first suggest you consider carefully whether this design works for your report users . Some report users find the experience confusing . They don &apos;t understand why slicer items dynamically appear or disappear when they interact with other slicers .
A different scenario involving bi-directional relationships treats a fact-type table like a bridging table . This way , it supports analyzing dimension-type table data within the filter context of a different dimension-type table .
Using the example model in this article , consider how the following questions can be answered :

# Monitor usage metrics for Power BI dashboards and reports
# # Why usage metrics are important
# # View a Usage Metrics report
1 . Start in the workspace that contains the dashboard or report .
# # # Report Usage Metrics report
# # About the Usage Metrics report
To dig into the report data , or to build your own reports against the underlying dataset , you have two options :
# # Which metrics are reported ?
# # Save a copy of the Usage Metrics report
# # See * all * workspace usage metrics
Now your report displays metrics for the entire workspace .
# # Power BI admin controls for usage metrics
# # # Discrepancies between audit logs and usage metrics
* Usage metrics may sometimes undercount activities due to inconsistent network connections , ad blockers , or other issues that can disrupt sending the events from the client .
* Certain types of views aren &apos;t included in usage metrics , as described earlier in this article .
In addition to potential differences between usage metrics and audit logs , the following questions and answers about usage metrics may be helpful for users and administrators :

# Configure Multi-Geo support for Power BI Premium
- Asia Pacific
After you &apos;ve created capacity , it remains in that region , and any workspaces created will have their content stored in that region . You can migrate workspaces from one region to another through the dropdown on the workspace settings screen .
You see this message to confirm the change .
You don &apos;t need to reset the gateway credentials during a migration at this time . After they &apos;re stored in the Premium capacity region , you will need to reset them upon migration .
During migration , certain operations may fail , such as publishing new datasets or scheduled data refresh .
The following items are stored in the Premium region when Multi-Geo is enabled :
- Models ( .ABF files ) for import and Direct Query datasets
These items remain in the home region for the tenant :
- Service buses for gateway queries or scheduled refresh jobs
- Dataset credentials
In the Admin Portal , you can view all the capacities for your Power BI tenant and the regions where they &apos;re currently located .
# # Change the region for existing content
If you need to change the region for existing content , you have two options .
- Create a second capacity and move workspaces . Free users won &apos;t experience any downtime as long as the tenant has spare v-cores .
# # Move content out of Multi-Geo
You can take workspaces out of Multi-Geo capacity in one of two ways :
- Migrate individual workspaces back to Premium capacity located in the home tenant .
- Confirm that any movement you initiate between regions follows all corporate and government compliance requirements prior to initiating data transfer .
title : &quot; Tutorial : Get started creating in the Power BI service &quot;
# Tutorial : Get started creating in the Power BI service
In this tutorial , you complete the following steps :
&gt; * Get some data and open it in report view .
&gt; * Use that data to create visualizations and save it as a report .
&gt; * Create a dashboard by pinning tiles from the report .
&gt; * Add other visualizations to your dashboard by using the Q &amp; A natural-language tool .
&gt; * Clean up resources by deleting the dataset , report , and dashboard .
# # Step 1 : Get data
1. open the report editor .
Power BI analyzes the data and creates a column chart visualization .
Some fields have sigma symbols next to them because Power BI detected that they contain numeric values .
Now you &apos;re looking at the report in Reading view .
A success message ( near the top-right corner ) lets you know the visualization was added as a tile to your dashboard .
Back in Editing view , you can continue to explore and pin tiles .
# # Step 3 : Explore with Q &amp; A
Q &amp; A searches for an answer and presents it in the form of a * card * visualization .
1 . Pin the bar chart to your Financial Sample dashboard , too .
You see that even though you changed the map to a bar chart in Q &amp; A , that tile remained a map because it was a map when you pinned it .
# # Step 4 : Reposition tiles
We can rearrange the tiles to make better use of the dashboard space .
Now the two tiles are the same height .
1 . Rearrange the other visuals to fit together .
That looks better .
Now that you &apos;ve finished the tutorial , you can delete the dataset , report , and dashboard .

title : Row-level security ( RLS ) in Power BI Report Server
# Row-level security ( RLS ) in Power BI Report Server
By default , row-level security filtering uses single-directional filters , regardless of whether the relationships are set to single direction or bidirectional . You can manually enable bidirectional cross-filter with row-level security .
# # Add members to roles
Here are the current limitations for row-level security on Power BI models .
If you &apos;re using integrated security with DirectQuery , then your users may notice :
- RLS is disabled and all data is returned .
- Users can &apos;t update their role assignments , and get an error on the RLS Manage page .
- For the DAX username function , you continue to receive the username as DOMAIN \ USER .
Report authors don &apos;t have access to view the report data in Power BI Report Server until they &apos;ve assigned themselves roles accordingly after uploading the report .
# # # Can I use RLS to limit the columns or measures accessible by my users ?
No , you secure individual rows of data but users can always see either the details or the summarized data .
Yes , if you already have existing roles defined and members assigned in Power BI Report Server , you can make additional roles and republish your report with no effect on your current assignments .
title : Connect to AI Insights in Power BI Desktop
# Use AI Insights in Power BI Desktop
# # How to enable AI Insights
# # Using Text Analytics and Vision
The services that are supported today are the following :
The transformations are executed on the Power BI service and do not require an Azure Cognitive Services subscription .
# # # Enabling Text Analytics and Vision on Premium capacities
This section describes the available functions in Cognitive Services in Power BI .
# # # # Detect language
# # # # Extract key phrases
# # # # Score sentiment
# # # # Tag images
# # # Invoking Text Analytics or Vision functions in Power Query
After signing in , select the function you want to use and the data column you want to transform in the pop-up window .
The first time you use AI Insights on a new data source , you &apos;re prompted to set the privacy level of your data .
After invoking the function , the result is added as a new column to the table . The transformation is also added as an applied step in the query .
Reports with applied Text Analytics and Vision functions should be published to a workspace that is not on a Premium capacity , otherwise refreshing the dataset will fail .
# # # Managing impact on a Premium capacity
The following sections describe how you can manage the impacts of Text Analytics and Vision on capacity .
# # # Considerations and limitations of Text Analytics
There are a few considerations and limitations to keep in mind when using Text Analytics .
* Incremental refresh is supported but can cause performance issues when used on queries with AI insights .
* Direct Query is not supported .
To learn more about Azure Machine Learning , see the following articles :
# # # Granting access to an Azure ML model

# # # Schema discovery for Machine Learning models
# # # Considerations and limitations of Azure ML
The following considerations and limitations apply to Azure ML in Power BI Desktop .
* Lots of other rectangles for all the other clothing sold .
You could compare the number of items sold across the other clothing categories by comparing the size and shading of each leaf node ; larger and darker rectangles mean higher value .
# # When to use a treemap
Treemaps are a great choice :
* To display large amounts of hierarchical data .
* When a bar chart can &apos;t effectively handle the large number of values .
* To show the pattern of the distribution of the measure across each level of categories in the hierarchy .
* To show attributes using size and color coding .
* To spot patterns , outliers , most-important contributors , and exceptions .
# # Create a basic treemap
You &apos;ll create a report and add a basic treemap .
&gt; Color Saturation and Details cannot be used at the same time .
# # Export data from a visual
And just like with a dashboard , you can export data from a visual within a report , too , by selecting the export button on a visual .
title : Export entire reports to PowerPoint
* Each page in the Power BI report becomes an individual slide in PowerPoint .
* Each page in the Power BI report is exported as a single high-resolution image in PowerPoint .
* You can preserve the filters and slicers settings that you added to the report .
* A link is created in PowerPoint that links to the Power BI report .
# # Export your Power BI report to PowerPoint
# # Open the PowerPoint file
3 . Each report page is a separate slide , as shown in the nav pane .
What you do with your PowerPoint deck from there , or any of the high-resolution images , is up to you .
* When exporting to PowerPoint , if the report uses a custom font , that font will be replaced with a default font .
* The following visual types are not supported , and will not be exported to PowerPoint :
- Background images are cropped with the chart &apos;s bounding area . We recommend that you remove background images before you export to PowerPoint .
* Some reports cannot be exported . These include :
- Reports with more than 50 report pages . Only the first 50 pages will be exported .
- Reports being exported to older versions of PowerPoint .
- Reports that take longer than an hour to process .
- Report pages that take longer than 6 minutes to load .

- Allow end users to export summarized data from the Power BI service or Power BI Report Server
- Allow end users to export both summarized and underlying data from the service or Report Server
- Don &apos;t allow end users to export any data from the service or Report Server
&gt; We recommend that report designers revisit old reports and manually reset the export option as needed .
To set these options :
You can also update this setting in the Power BI service .
- Export using * Underlying data * won &apos;t work if :
- the version is older than 2016 .
- the tables in the model don &apos;t have a unique key .
- an administrator or report designer has disabled this feature .
- There are too many columns . Try reducing the number of columns and exporting again .
- There &apos;s data that is difficult to compress .
- Other factors are at play that increase file size and decrease the number of rows Power BI can export .
- Power BI visuals and R visuals aren &apos;t currently supported .
- Power BI admins can disable the export of data .

&#124; User / parent-child hierarchies &#124; Hierarchies &#124;
# # # Measures , measure groups , and KPIs
# # # Dimension attribute type
# # # Dimension calculated members
Multidimensional models support creation of various types of * calculated members * . The two most common types of calculated members are :
* Calculated members on user hierarchies
Multidimensional models expose * calculated members on attribute hierarchies * as values of a column . You have a few additional options and constraints if you expose this type of calculated member :
* An attribute containing calculated members can &apos;t be the key attribute of the dimension unless it &apos;s the only attribute of the dimension .
* An attribute containing calculated members can &apos;t be a parent-child attribute .
There are certain limitations to using SSAS MD :
* You can &apos;t create * report level * measures when authoring a report that is connected live to an SSAS multidimensional model . The only measures that are available are measures defined in the MD model .
* Dimension calculated members , which :
* must be a single real member when the dimension has more than one attribute ;
* can &apos;t be the key attribute of the dimension unless it &apos;s the only attribute ; and
* can &apos;t be a parent-child attribute .
* Display folders
* Measures ( with or without measure groups )
* Measures as variant

# # What is our dashboard telling us ?
Our sales manager has created a dashboard to track those metrics most important to them . When they see something interesting , they can select a tile to look into the data :
- Opportunity count and revenue follow a familiar funnel pattern , with totals decreasing with each subsequent stage .
- Most of our opportunities are in the East region .
- Large opportunities generate more revenue than medium or small opportunities .
Because the effort to land a deal is the same whether the deal is classified as large , medium , or small , our company should analyze the data to learn more about large opportunities .
# # Explore the pages in the report
View each page in the report by selecting the page tabs at the bottom .
# # # Opportunity Count Overview page
Note the following details :
* East is our biggest region in terms of opportunity counts .
# # # Revenue Analysis page
This page takes a similar look at the data , but uses a revenue perspective instead of count .
* East is our biggest region , not only in opportunity count but also in revenue .
* For partner driven businesses , average revenue for large-sized opportunities is almost double that of medium-sized opportunities .
* Average revenue for small and medium businesses is comparable for both partner driven and non-partner driven business .
Clearly our partners are doing a better job than non-partners selling to customers . It might make sense to funnel more deals through our partners .
This page of the report looks at data similar to the data on the previous page but breaks it down by region and stage .
* Large opportunities are most common in the Central region , small opportunities are most common in the East region , and medium opportunities are most common in the West region .
# # # Upcoming Opportunities by Month page
For this page we &apos;re looking at similar factors , but from a date and time perspective .
Our CFO uses this page to manage workload . By looking at the revenue opportunities by sales stage and month , they can plan accordingly .
* Average revenue for the Finalize sales stage is the highest . Closing these deals is a top priority .

- Assign workspace roles to user groups and individuals .
- Create a workspace in Power BI without creating a Microsoft 365 group .
- Use more granular workspace roles for more flexible permissions management .
# # Create one of the new workspaces
1 . Here are some optional items you can set for your workspace :
Power BI creates the workspace and opens it . You see it in the list of workspaces you ’ re a member of .
# # Create a contact list
In the * * Create a workspace * * pane when you first create it .
# # # Access the workspace OneDrive location
After you &apos;ve configured the OneDrive location , you get to it in the same way you get to other data sources in the Power BI service .
# # # Connect to apps in new workspaces
In the new workspace experience , you can &apos;t create or consume organizational content packs . Ask your internal teams to provide apps for any content packs you ’ re currently using .
# # Give access to your workspace
Anyone who has an admin role in a workspace can give others access to the workspace .
When enabled , Contributors can :
* Update app metadata like name , icon , description , support site , and color
* Add or remove items included in the app , like adding reports or datasets
* Change the app navigation or default item the app opens on
However , Contributors are not able to :
* Publish the app for the first time
* Change who has permission to the app

3 . Add a message if you want . It &apos;s optional .
# # See who has access to a dashboard or report
Sometimes you need to see the people you &apos;ve shared with , and see who they &apos;ve shared it with .
People outside your organization are listed as * * Guest * * .
# # Share a dashboard or report outside your organization
They can &apos;t edit any content in this dashboard or report . They can interact with the charts and change filters or slicers , but can &apos;t save their changes .
People outside your organization don &apos;t see any data at all if role- or row-level security is implemented on on-premises Analysis Services tabular models .
# # # Allow external users to edit content
# # Share with more than 100 separate users
- Share multiple times by specifying the users individually .

The following section describes troubleshooting steps you can take to help address trouble you might run into .
# # # Missing or outdated R packages
When attempting to install an R-powered custom visual , you can run into errors when there are missing or outdated R packages ; this is due to one of the following reasons :
* The R installation is incompatible with the R package
* The firewall , anti-virus software , or proxy settings are preventing R from connecting to the Internet
* The Internet connection is slow or there &apos;s an Internet connection problem
1 . Remove the custom visual , then install it again . This initiates a reinstallation of the R packages .
Supported R versions are listed in the description of each R-powered custom visual , as shown in the following image .
3 . Install R packages manually , using any R console . The steps for this approach follow :

title : &quot; DAX : Avoid using FILTER as a filter argument &quot;
&gt; This article is especially relevant for model calculations that apply filters to Import tables .
There are , however , restrictions that apply to Boolean expressions when they &apos;re used as filter arguments . They :
- Cannot compare columns to other columns
- Cannot reference a measure
- Cannot use nested CALCULATE functions
- Cannot use functions that scan or return a table
It means that you &apos;ll need to use table expressions for more complex filter requirements .
Consider now a different measure definition .
Here &apos;s one more example . The requirement this time is to calculate sales , but only for months that have achieved a profit .
For best performance , we recommend you use Boolean expressions as filter arguments , whenever possible .
Therefore , the FILTER function should only be used when necessary . You can use it to perform filter complex column comparisons . These column comparisons can involve :

# # # Ad hoc per item sharing
The process is considered ad-hoc since business users in Contoso perform the invite action as needed for their business purposes . Each item shared is a single link the external user can access to view the content .
# # # Planned per item sharing
# # # Ad hoc or planned sharing of Power BI Apps
1 . The process starts by the user being invited to Contoso &apos;s Azure AD organization through the Azure portal or PowerShell
# # # Commenting and subscribing to content across organizations
# # # Access content in the Power BI mobile apps
# # # Cross-organization editing and management of Power BI content
This scenario is described in detail in the section Enabling external users to edit and manage content within Power BI later in this document .
# # # Case 1 : Direct collaboration between organizations
# # # Case 2 : Parent and its subsidiaries or affiliates
This follows the following process :
1 . Users from each Subsidiary are invited to Contoso &apos;s Azure AD
3 . Finally , the users open the app through a link they &apos;ve been given to see the reports
Several important challenges are faced by organizations in this structure :
- How to distribute links to content in the Parent organization &apos;s Power BI
- How to allow subsidiary users to access data source hosted by the parent organization
# # # # Allowing subsidiary users to access data sources hosted by the parent organization
More sophisticated approaches are also possible , however the above are by far the most common .
# # # Case 3 : Shared environment across partners
The process is as follows :
# # # Case 4 : Distribution to hundreds or thousands of external partners
- Other authors are added to the workspace
- Content is created inside the workspace
Now that the content is created in a workspace , Contoso is ready to invite guest users in partner organizations to consume this content .
2 . Invite Guest Users
* Planned Invites
- Add an invitation message for the guest users and click Invite
After the invitation , guest users receive an email with the invitation link .
Once the guest users click the link , they can access content in the Contoso Azure AD tenant .
&gt; Invites are needed only the first time an external user is invited to your organization .
3 . Distribute Content
Guest users get an email with a link to the app .
On clicking this link , guest users are asked to authenticate with their own organization &apos;s identity .
Once they are successfully authenticated , they are redirected to Contoso &apos;s BI app .
4 . Next steps
Contoso can choose one of three approaches to license guest users from its suppliers and partner organizations to have access to Power BI content .
# # Data security for external partners
Let &apos;s walk through this with an example .
This opens a page where Contoso &apos;s BI team can see the two roles they created . Now Contoso &apos;s BI team can assign users to the roles .
Now when this user opens the app that was shared with them , they only see a report with data from Europe :
Let &apos;s look at a small example - Contoso has a simple report on sales by groups :
Then , Contoso creates the right data model that filters the data appropriately with the right relationships :
Now , when the guest users open the report , they only see sales from group A :
Now the internal user gets to see all the data :
As you can see , Dynamic RLS works with both internal or guest users .
# # Connecting to on premises data sources
# # Enabling external users to edit and manage content within Power BI
Contoso can allow external users to contribute content within the organization as described earlier in the cross-organization editing and management of Power BI content section .
In the Power BI Admin portal , the setting is shown in the following image .
To help these users to log in to Power BI , provide them with the Tenant URL . To find the tenant URL , follow these steps .
&gt; When using this option make sure to review the governance section of this document since default Azure AD settings prevent Guest users to use certain features like people pickers which can lead to a reduced experience . * *
- Direct publishing from Power BI desktop to the Power BI service
- Guest users cannot use Power BI desktop to connect to service datasets in the Power BI service
- Sending ad-hoc invites is not supported for workspace access lists
- Guest users cannot install a Power BI Gateway and connect it to your organization
- Guest users cannot install apps publish to the entire organization
- Guest users cannot use , create , update , or install organizational content packs
- Guest users cannot use Analyze in Excel
- Guest users cannot be @ mentioned in commenting ( this functionality will be added in an upcoming release )
- Guest users who use this capability should have a work or school account . Guest users using Personal accounts experience more limitations due to sign-in restrictions .
Details on the settings are available here :
- Turn off invitations by end users
- Only admins and users in the Guest Inviter role can invite
- Admins , the Guest Inviter role , and members can invite
- All users , including guests , can invite
# # # Conditional Access policies for guest users
Reasons to choose this alternative :
- Users who use personal accounts for their business often are restricted from accessing certain services so may need an organizational account .
Reasons not to choose this alternative :
- When the user leaves their organization , they continue to have access to Contoso &apos;s resources until the Contoso admin manually deletes their account
- Contoso admins have to manage the identity for the guest , including creation , password resets , etc .
- Typical Partner Portals are highly branded experiences with consistent experiences across partners and streamlined to meet the needs of typical partners . Contoso can therefore offer a better overall experience to partners by integrating all required services into a single portal .
- Provides better isolation across partners if architected as a multi-tenant solution .
- Significant effort is required to build , operate , and maintain such a portal making it a significant investment in resources and time .
- Time to solution is much longer than using B2B sharing since careful planning and execution across multiple workstreams is required .
- Where there are a smaller number of partners the effort required for this alternative is likely too high to justify .
- Collaboration with ad-hoc sharing is the primary scenario faced by your organization .
- The reports and dashboards are different for each partner . This alternative introduces management overhead beyond just sharing directly with Partners .

title : Use the Analyze feature to explain fluctuations in report visuals
# Use the Analyze feature to explain fluctuations in report visuals
The Analyze feature is contextual , and is based on the immediately previous data point - such as the previous bar , or column .
&gt; This feature is in preview , and is subject to change . The insight feature is enabled and on by default ( you don &apos;t need to check a Preview box to enable it ) .
# # # Which factors and categories are chosen
The dotted line shows the best fit , and data points above this line increased by more than the overall trend , and those below it by less .
Data items whose value was blank in either period will not appear on the scatter plot .
In this scenario , an investigation was triggered when users complained that report data sometimes appeared to be old or &quot; stale &quot; .
There are several possible explanations for these results :
- Inefficient Power Query logic may be resulting in a memory usage spike during dataset refresh . On a busy capacity , this spike can occasionally reach the physical limit , failing the refresh and potentially affecting other report view operations on the capacity .
- Frequently queried datasets that need to stay in memory may affect the ability of other datasets to refresh because of limited available memory .
To help investigate , the Power BI administrator can look for :
- Low available memory at the time of data refreshes when available memory is less than 2x the size of the dataset to be refreshed .
The Power BI administrator can attempt to resolve the issue by taking steps to ensure that sufficient memory is available for data refreshes to start by :
- Contacting dataset owners and asking them to stagger and space out data refresh schedules .
- Reducing dataset query load by removing unnecessary dashboards or dashboard tiles , especially those that enforce row-level security .
There are several possible reasons for query wait time buildup in datasets :
# # Identifying causes for sporadically slow-responding datasets
# # Determining whether there is enough memory
In a healthy capacity the visual will look like this , showing a gap between All ( total ) and Active memory :
# # Determining whether there is enough CPU
title : Complete code listing
# Push data to a dataset complete code listing
# # Push data to dataset code
title : Dataset modes in the Power BI service
# Dataset modes in the Power BI service
The three dataset modes are :
Design flexibility can be achieved in three ways . Data modelers can :
As shown in the following image , an Import model can integrate data from any number of supported data source types .
However , while there are compelling advantages associated with Import models , there are disadvantages , too :
- Model data is only as current as the latest refresh , and so Import models need to be refreshed , usually on a scheduled basis
From a Power BI service resource perspective , Import models require :
- Sufficient memory to load the model when it &apos;s queried or refreshed
- Processing resources and additional memory resources to refresh data
There are two main reasons to consider developing a DirectQuery model :
There are several advantages associated with DirectQuery models :
- Import model size limits don &apos;t apply
- Dashboard tiles , when based on DirectQuery models , can update automatically as frequently as every 15 minutes
However , there are some limitations associated with DirectQuery models :
- DAX formulas are limited to use only functions that can be transposed to native queries understood by the data source . Calculated tables are not supported .
- Q &amp; A and Quick Insights features aren &apos;t supported
From a Power BI service resource perspective , DirectQuery models require :
- Minimal memory to load the model ( metadata only ) when it &apos;s queried
title : Create a drill-through button in Power BI
# Create a drill-through button in Power BI
# # Set up a drill-through button
Because the drill-through button has two states , enabled vs. disabled , you see two tooltip options .
If you leave the tooltips boxes blank , Power BI automatically generates tooltips . Those tooltips are based on the destination and drill-through field ( s ) .
Here &apos;s an example of the autogenerated tooltip when the button is disabled :
And here &apos;s an example of the autogenerated tooltip when the button is enabled :
After you select the drill-through button , you see filters on both Store and Product being passed through to the destination page :
# # # Ambiguous filter context
Since the drill-through button isn &apos;t tied to a single visual , if your selection is ambiguous , then the button is disabled .
# # Customize formatting for disabled buttons
You can customize the formatting options for the disabled state of drill-through buttons .
These formatting options include :
You can use conditional formatting to change the button text based on the selected value of a field . To do this , you need to create a measure that outputs the desired string based on the DAX function SELECTEDVALUE .
Then , you select the measure you created for the button text :
When a single product is selected , the button text reads :
&quot; See details for Word &quot;
When either no products are selected , or more than one product is selected , the button is disabled . The button text reads :
&quot; See product details &quot;
# # Set formatting for tooltips conditionally
If the user hasn &apos;t selected either a single product or a single store , the measure returns : “ Select a single product and Ctrl + click to also select a single store . ”
# # Set the drill-through destination conditionally
You can use conditional formatting to set the drill-through destination based on the output of a measure .
Here are some scenarios where you might want the button drill-through destination to be conditional :
# # # Disable the button until multiple conditions are met
Here ’ s an example DAX measure that requires a Store to be selected before the user can drill through on a Product to Store details page :
For the last step , you select the DAX measure you created as the field value for the destination :
Now you see the button is disabled even when a single product is selected , because the measure also requires you to select a single store :
# # # Support multiple destinations
For the other common case where you want to support multiple destinations , you start by creating a single-column table with the names of the drill-through destinations :
Power BI uses exact string match to set the drill-through destination , so double-check that the entered values exactly align with your drill-through page names .
After you &apos;ve created the table , add it to the page as a single-select slicer :
Alternatively , change the list slicer from vertical to horizontal orientation :
Now you see that the drill-through button is only enabled when you &apos;ve selected a product * and * a destination :
# # # Hybrid of the two scenarios
Here ’ s an example DAX measure that requires the user to select a Store before they can drill through on a Product to any of drill-through pages :
- This button doesn &apos;t allow for multiple destinations using a single button .
- This button only supports drill throughs within the same report ; in other words , it doesn &apos;t support cross-report drill through .

This article describes service principal authentication using * Application ID * and * Application secret * .
&gt; We recommend that you secure your backend services using certificates , rather than secret keys .
To use service principal and an application ID with embedded analytics , follow these steps :
1 . Create the Azure AD app &apos;s secret .
2 . Create an Azure AD security group .
3 . Enable the Power BI service admin settings .
4 . Add the service principal to your workspace .
5 . Embed your content .

&gt; After you leave this window , the client secret value will be hidden , and you &apos;ll not be able to view or copy it again .
# # # Creating an Azure AD app using PowerShell
# # Step 2 - Create an Azure AD security group
There are two ways to create an Azure AD security group :
# # # Create a security group manually
Below is a sample script for creating a new security group , and adding an app to that security group .
&gt; If you want to enable service principal access for the entire organization , skip this step .
# # Step 3 - Enable the Power BI service admin settings
&gt; Service principals have access to any tenant settings they &apos;re enabled for . Depending on your admin settings , this includes specific security groups or the entire organization .
&gt; To restrict service principal access to specific tenant settings , allow access only to specific security groups . Alternatively , you can create a dedicated security group for service principals , and exclude it from the desired tenant settings .

title : Referencing Power Query queries
Generally , we recommend you reference queries to avoid the duplication of logic across your queries . However , as described in this article , this design approach can contribute to slow data refreshes , and overburden data sources .
We suggest you use the Implementation 2.0 SAP Connector whenever possible .
When you select one or more items from the server , the Navigator dialog creates a preview of the output table .
Implementation 2.0 supports the following options :
The default value is `SapBusinessWarehouseExecutionMode.BasXmlGzip` .
Using `SapBusinessWarehouseExecutionMode.BasXmlGzip` may improve performance when experiencing high latency for large datasets .
The following list describes some of the additional improvements that come with the new implementation :
* Improved performance .
* Ability to retrieve several million rows of data , and fine-tuning through the batch size parameter .
* Ability to switch execution modes .
* Support for compressed mode . Especially beneficial for high latency connections or large datasets .
* Improved detection of `Date` variables .
* Better exception handling . Errors that occur in BAPI calls are now surfaced .
# # # Changing existing reports to use Implementation 2.0
Changing existing reports to use Implementation 2.0 is only possible in import mode . Follow these steps :
Determine whether the query already contains an option record , such as the following example :
If the query doesn &apos;t already include an options record , just add it . For the following option :
Just change it to :

title : Understand data view mapping in Power BI visuals
# Understand data view mapping in Power BI visuals
This article discusses data view mapping and describes how data roles relate to each other and allow you to specify conditional requirements for them . The article also describes each `dataMappings` type .
Power BI creates a mapping to a data view if and only if the valid mapping is filled in `dataViewMappings` .
Power BI produces a data view with a single `categorical` mapping , and `table` and other mappings are undefined :
Currently , for each field , you can specify a minimum and maximum value . The value represents the number of fields that can be bound to that data role .
&gt; If a data role is omitted in the condition , it can have any number of fields .
You can drag multiple fields into each data role . In this example , you limit the category to one data field and the measure to two data fields .
In this example , either of two conditions is required :
* Exactly one category data field and exactly two measures
* Exactly two categories and exactly one measure .
&gt; This data mapping can &apos;t be used in conjunction with any other data mapping . It &apos;s meant to reduce data into a single numeric value .
Code sample to process simple data view mapping
As a result the visual displays a single value from Power BI :
Categorical data mapping is used to get one or two independent groupings of data .
Here is the definition from the previous example for data roles :
Here is the mapping :
This example uses the first two data roles from the previous example and additionally defines `grouping` and `measure2` .
Here is the data view mapping :
The categorical data view could be visualized like this :
Power BI produces it as the categorical data view . It &apos;s the set of categories .
Each category maps to a set of values as well . Each of these values is grouped by series , which is expressed as years .
For example , each `values` array represents data for each year .
The result of the visual :
The table data view is a simple data mapping . Essentially , it &apos;s a list of data points , where numeric data points could be aggregated .
With the given capabilities :
You can visualize the table data view as the following :
You can aggregate the data by selecting the desired field and then selecting sum .
Code sample to process table data view mapping .
The visual styles file `style / visual.less` contains layout for table :
# # Matrix data mapping
Matrix data mapping is similar to table data mapping , but the rows are presented hierarchically . Any of the data role values can be used as a column header value .
The core matrix visual of Power BI renders the data as a table .
The visual gets its data structure as described in the following code ( only the first two table rows are shown here ) :
To control the amount of data to receive in the data view , you can apply a data reduction algorithm .
There are four types of data reduction algorithm settings :
The data reduction algorithm can be used in categorical , table , or matrix data view mapping .
You can apply the data reduction algorithm to the `rows` section of the Data View mapping table .
You can apply the data reduction algorithm to the `rows` and `columns` sections of the Data View mapping matrix .
title : Create Power BI visuals using R
# Create Power BI visuals using R
# # Enable R visuals in Power BI Desktop
After you &apos;ve verified your R installation , you ’ re ready to begin creating R visuals .
# # Create R visuals in Power BI Desktop
When you add an R visual to a report , Power BI Desktop makes the following changes :
- A placeholder R visual image appears on the report canvas .
&gt; The default aggregation type for R visuals is * do not summarize * .
4 . Now you can use the data you selected to create a plot :
* The default aggregation is : * do not summarize * .
* Similar to table visuals , fields are grouped and duplicate rows appear only once .
Power BI Desktop replots the visual when any of the following events occur :
The following image shows an example of the correlation plot code , which plots the correlations between attributes of different types of cars .
7 . Modify the R script to customize the visual , and take advantage of the power of R by adding parameters to the plotting command .
The original plotting command is :
Change the R script so that the plotting command is as follows :
As a result , the R visual now plots circles , only considers the upper half , and reorders the matrix to cluster correlated attributes .
* Resolution : All R visuals are displayed at 72 DPI .
* Plotting device : Only plotting to the default device is supported .
* Calculation times : If an R visual calculation exceeds five minutes , it causes a time-out error .
* Highlights : R visuals respond if you highlight other visuals , but you can &apos;t select elements in the R visual to cross filter other elements .
* Display devices : Only plots that are plotted to the R default display device are displayed correctly on the canvas . Avoid explicitly using a different R display device .
* Column renaming : R visuals do not support renaming input columns . Columns will be referred to by their original name during script execution .

# # # Number-related helper methods
- `getRandomNumbers` generates a random number using min and max values . You can specify `exceptionList` and provide a function for result change .
- `getRandomNumbers` provides an array of random numbers generated by the `getRandomNumber` method with specified min and max values
# # # Event-related helper methods
The following methods are written for web page event simulation in unit tests .
- `clickElement` simulates a click on the specified element
# # # D3 event-related helper methods
The following methods are used to simulate D3 events in unit tests .
- `flushAllD3Transitions` forces all D3 transitions to complete
&gt; These flickers are more noticeable on IE and with a large number of webviews and are not recommended for iOS .
&gt; By flushing the timer queue at the end of the first event loop you can run any zero-delay transitions immediately and avoid the flicker .
The following methods are also included :
The following interface and enumerations are used in the helper function .

# Create and use combo charts in Power BI
Combo charts can have one or two Y axes .
# # When to use a Combo chart
Combo charts are a great choice :
* when you have a line chart and a column chart with the same X axis .
* to compare multiple measures with different value ranges .
* to illustrate the correlation between two measures in one visualization .
* to check whether one measure meet the target which is defined by another measure
* to conserve canvas space .
# # Create a basic , single-axis , Combo Chart
Watch Will create a combo chart using the Sales and Marketing sample .
1 . Start on a blank report page and create a column chart that displays this year &apos;s sales and gross margin by month .
Your combo chart should look something like this :
# # Create a combo chart with two axes
In this task , we &apos;ll compare gross margin and sales .
3 . To make the visual easier to read and interpret , convert the line chart to a Line and Stacked Column chart .
# # Add titles to the axes
Your combo chart now displays dual axes , both with titles .

# Power BI report scheduled refresh in Power BI Report Server
Scheduled refresh for Power BI reports allows the data for a report to stay up to date .
Several components are involved when using scheduled refresh for your Power BI reports .
* SQL Server Agent as a timer to generate scheduled events .
* Scheduled jobs are added to a queue of events and notifications in the report server database . In a scale-out deployment , the queue is shared across all of the report servers in the deployment .
* All report processing that occurs as a result of a schedule event is performed as a background process .
* The data model is loaded within an Analysis Services instance .
* In a scale-out configuration , the data model can be replicated across nodes .
* Analysis Services processes the data and executes any needed calculations .
# # # When scheduled refresh can &apos;t be used
Not all Power BI Reports can have a scheduled refresh plan created on them . The following is a list of Power BI Reports that you Can &apos;t create a scheduled refresh plan .
* Your report contains one or more Analysis Services data sources , which use a live connection .
* Your report contains one or more data sources , which use DirectQuery .

title : Filters and highlighting in Power BI reports
# Filters and highlighting in Power BI reports
* Introduction to filters and highlighting , the article you &apos;re reading now .
# # Intro to the Filters pane
There are four types of filters .
- * * page filter * * applies to all the visuals on the report page
- * * report filter * * applies to all pages in the report
- * * drillthrough filter * * applies to a single entity in a report
You can search in page , visual , and report filters , in Reading or Editing view , to find and select the value you want .
# # Filters in Reading or Editing view
* In Reading view , you can interact with any filters that already exist in the report , and save the selections you make . You can &apos;t add new filters .
# # # Filters in Reading view
If you only have access to a report in Reading view , the Filters pane looks similar to this :
So this page of the report has six page-level filters and one report-level filter .
# # # Filters in Editing view
As in Reading view , we see this page of the report has six page-level filters and one report-level filter . And by selecting the bubble chart , we &apos;d see it has six visual level filters applied .
# Use visual elements to enhance Power BI reports
The following sections describe how to use these enhancements , and how to apply them to your reports .
# # Using wallpaper in Power BI reports
It &apos;s useful to keep in mind the following definitions that pertain to * * wallpaper * * :
* The gray area outside of your report area is the * * wallpaper * * area
For all new reports , the default settings are the following :
# # Using improved visual headers in Power BI reports
If your visual doesn &apos;t have a title , the header floats above the top of the visual aligned to the right , as shown in the following image .
If your visual is positioned all the way to the top of your report , the visual header instead snaps to the bottom of the visual .
# # # Enabling improved visual headers for existing reports
# Use cross-report drill through in Power BI
The drill-through action opens the * target page * in the * target report * .
This article shows you how to set up and use cross-report drill through for Power BI reports .
After you validate your models , enable the source report to use cross-report drill through .
You can also enable cross-report drill through from the Power BI service .
1 . In Power BI service , select the workspace that contains your target and source reports .
# # Set up a cross-report drill-through target
That &apos;s it . Your reports are ready for cross-report drill through .
You see the results in the target cross-report drill-through page , just as you set them up when you created the target . The results are filtered according to the drill-through settings .
- Cross-filter and cross-highlighting that affect the source visual
- Slicers and sync-slicers on the page
Cross-report drill through doesn &apos;t work in Power BI reports in Power BI Report Server .
title : &quot; Active vs inactive relationship guidance &quot;
Here &apos;s a partial model diagram of the two tables .
Here &apos;s the improved model design .
The improved model design supports producing the following report design .
The report page filters by Melbourne as the departure airport , and the table visual groups by arrival airports .
&gt; Further , it &apos;s common that dimension-type tables contain low row counts relative to fact-type table row counts . So , the increased model size and refresh times aren &apos;t likely to be excessively large .
Here &apos;s a methodology to refactor a model from a single role-playing dimension-type table , to a design with _ one table per role _ .
1 . Remove any inactive relationships .
4 . Create an active relationship to relate the new table .
In specific circumstances , inactive relationships can address special reporting needs .
Let &apos;s now consider different model and reporting requirements :
- Each row in the * * Sales * * table records a single order
- There &apos;s no requirement to simultaneously filter ( or group by ) order _ and _ ship date periods
This model design supports producing the following report design .
- There &apos;s no requirement for report visuals to simultaneously filter by different roles
- You use the USERELATIONSHIP DAX function to activate a specific relationship for relevant model calculations

title : Types of licenses for Power BI consumers
# Licenses and subscriptions for * consumers *
What you can do in the Power BI service depends on three things :
- the type of license and subscription you &apos;re using ,
- where content is stored , and
- the roles and permissions you &apos;re assigned .
It &apos;s possible to have more than one license at the same time . The service always delivers you the experience equal to the most-permissive license you currently have .
# # Power BI Premium capacity
# # Find out which licenses you have
This second user , Zalan , has a Power BI free license .
# # Find out if you have access to Premium capacity
We can determine whether Zalan &apos;s organization has Premium capacity by looking up the amount of storage available .
Notice that a Pro user has already shared a workspace with Zalan . The diamond icon shows that this workspace is stored in Premium capacity .
# # Identify content hosted in Premium capacity
Another way to find out if your organization has Premium capacity is to look for apps and app workspaces with a diamond icon . The diamond indicates that the content is stored in Premium capacity .
In the image below , three of the apps are stored in Premium capacity .
&#124; License type &#124; Shared capacity &#124; Dedicated capacity &#124;
In the diagram below , the left side represents Pro users who create and share content in app workspaces .

Using * * variables * * are an extremely powerful part of a DAX expression .
You can define a variable anywhere in a DAX expression , using the following syntax :
Variables can be any data type , including entire tables .
title : Show the data that was used to create the visual
# Show data with Power BI reports
# # Show the data being used to create a report visual
3 . By default , the data displays below the visual .
# DAX : Use COUNTROWS instead of COUNT
As a data modeler , sometimes you might need to write a DAX expression that counts table rows . The table could be a model table or an expression that returns a table .
However , the following measure definition is a better solution .
There are three reasons why the second measure definition is better :
- It &apos;s more efficient , and so it will perform better .
- The intention of formula is clearer , to the point of being self-describing .
When it &apos;s your intention to count table rows , we recommend that you always use the COUNTROWS function .
# Work with Modeling view in Power BI Desktop
The following articles describe more about data models , and also describe DirectQuery in detail .
# Expression examples in Power BI Report Builder
This topic provides examples of expressions that can be used for common tasks in a report .
For example , this expression will show the number of the week in the current year for today &apos;s date :
When used as a calculated field in a dataset , you can use this expression on a chart to aggregate values by week within each month .
The following example displays the start date of the current year
- The following example displays the start date for the previous month based on the current month .
- The following expressions display various dates based on a date parameter value selected by the user .
&#124; Example Description &#124; Example &#124;
The following example does the same as the above example , as well as displays a text string prior to the list of selected values .
When designing a report , you may want to display the name of the report and page number in the report footer . To do this , you can use the following expressions :
- The following expression , placed in a text box in the footer of a report , provides page number and total pages in the report :
The following examples describe how to display the first and last values from a page in the page header , similar to what you might find in a directory listing . The example assumes a data region that contains a text box named `LastName` .
The following example describes how to display a page total . The example assumes a data region that contains a text box named `Cost` .
&gt; You can refer to only one report item per expression in a page header or footer . Also , you can refer to the text box name , but not the actual data expression within the text box , in page header and footer expressions .
You can also use the Visual Basic object variable `Me` . This variable is another way of referring to the value of a text box .
If you are using an expression for a specified scope , you may have to indicate the dataset for the aggregate function :
&gt; Available colors come from the .NET Framework KnownColor enumeration .
You can show and hide items in a report using the visibility properties for the report item . In a data region such as a table , you can initially hide detail rows based on the value in an expression .
You can customize URLs by using report data and also conditionally control whether URLs are added as an action for a text box .
- The following expression , when used as an action on a text box , generates a customized URL that specifies the dataset field `EmployeeID` as a URL parameter .
Expressions can be used to manipulate the data that is used in the report . You can refer to parameters and other report information . You can even change the query that is used to retrieve data for the report .
You can use custom code embedded in a report .
# # # Using group variables for custom aggregation
You can initialize the value for a group variable that is local to a particular group scope and then include a reference to that variable in expressions . One of the ways that you can use a group variable with custom code is to implement a custom aggregate .
# # Suppressing null or zero values at run time
To avoid this condition , use one of the following strategies :
# # Make sure your data is formatted as a table
You &apos;ll want to make sure each column has a good name . It will make it easier to find the data you want when creating your reports in Power BI .
# # Import from a local drive
Once imported into Power BI , you can begin creating reports .
title : Change the display size and ratio of a report page
# Change the display of a report page

# Troubleshoot scheduled refresh in Power BI Report Server
This article discusses resources available to troubleshoot issues with scheduled refresh in Power BI Report Server .
The following are the more common issues you will hit when trying to schedule refresh for a report .
# # # Driver related problems
Please refer to the manufacturer for details on how to install and configure 3rd party drivers .
Memory pressure can occur when reports require more memory to process and render . Schedule refresh on reports may demand a significant amount of memory on the machine . Especially for larger reports . Memory pressure can result in report failures as well as a potential crash of the report server itself .
Information about known issues will be listed here when they become available .
# # # Logs relevant for scheduled refresh of Power BI reports
# # # # Enabling Verbose Logging
Execution log entries for Power BI reports differ from entries for other report types .
* There are 2 Request Types and subsequent item actions :
There may be times you want to modify Analysis Services for diagnosing issues , or adjust memory limits .
&gt; These settings will be reset any time you upgrade the report server . Be sure to keep a copy of your changes and reapply them if needed .
The following settings are reset when ever the Analysis Services process is launched . Any changes you make to these will be ignored .
# # # Profiling the local Analysis Services process
# # Lock Pages In Memory Windows privilege
After you &apos;ve installed the template app , you can customize the dashboard and report to highlight the information you care about most . Then you can distribute it as an app to colleagues in your organization .

title : Understand how visuals interact in a report
# How visuals cross-filter each other in a Power BI report
# # How visuals interact with each other
# # # Cross-filtering and cross-highlighting
# Create Power BI visuals by using Python
# # Create Python visuals in Power BI Desktop
When you add a Python visual to a report , Power BI Desktop takes the following actions :
- A placeholder Python visual image appears on the report canvas .
&gt; The default aggregation type for Python visuals is * do not summarize * .
1 . Now you can use the data you selected to create a plot .
As you select or remove fields , supporting code in the Python script editor is automatically generated or removed .
Based on your selections , the Python script editor generates the following binding code .
- The default aggregation is : * do not summarize * .
- Similar to table visuals , fields are grouped and duplicate rows appear only once .
Power BI Desktop replots the visual if any of the following events occur :
- Whenever a data change occurs , due to data refresh , filtering , or highlighting
Ok , let &apos;s create some visuals .
# # Create a scatter plot
Let &apos;s create a scatter plot to see if there &apos;s a correlation between age and weight .
Your Python script editor pane should now look like this :
The * * matplotlib * * library is imported to plot and create our visuals .
# # Create a line plot with multiple columns
# # Create a bar plot
Python visuals in Power BI Desktop have a few limitations :
- Resolution . All Python visuals are displayed at 72 DPI .
- Calculation time limitation . If a Python visual calculation exceeds five minutes the execution times out which results in an error .
- Python visuals respond to highlighting other visuals , but you can &apos;t click on elements in the Python visual to cross filter other elements .
- Only plots that are plotted to the Python default display device are displayed correctly on the canvas . Avoid explicitly using a different Python display device .
- Python visuals do not support renaming input columns . Columns will be referred to by their original name during script execution .
Take a look at the following additional information about Python in Power BI .
title : Guidance for deploying a data gateway for Power BI
This article provides guidance and considerations for deploying a data gateway for Power BI in your network environment .
# # Installation considerations for the on-premises data gateway
# # # Number of users
The number of users who consume a report that uses the gateway is an important metric in your decision about where to install the gateway . Here are some questions to consider :
* Do users use these reports at different times of the day ?
* Do all users use the same report ?
Here &apos;s what to consider for each option :
title : Add Drill-Down support
Power BI visuals can use Power BI &apos;s drill-down .
# # Enable drill-down support in the visual
&gt; The drill-down dataRole must be of `Grouping` type .
&gt; `max` property in the dataRole conditions must be set to 1 .
Once you add the role to drill-down , users can drag multiple fields into the data role .
# # Create the visual with drill-down support
to create a default sample visual . And apply the above sample of `capabilities.json` to the newly created visual .
Create the property for `div` container to hold HTML elements of the visual :
Update the constructor of the visual :
Update the `update` method of the visual to create `button`s :
Prepare sample data to test the visual :
After those steps you should get following visual :
# # Add context menu to visual elements
In this step you &apos;ll add context menu to the button &apos;s on the visual :
To create context menu , save `host` object in the properties of the visual and call `createSelectionManager` method to the create selection manager to display a context menu by using Power BI Visuals API .
Change the body of `forEach` function callback to :
Apply data to the visual :
In the final step you should get visual with selections and context menu :
# # Add drill-down support for matrix data view mapping
Prepare sample data to test the visual with matrix data view mappings :
Apply following dataview mapping for the visual :
Import required interfaces to process matrix data view mappings :
Create two properties for two `div`s of rows and columns elements :
Check the data before rendering elements and display the current level of hierarchy :
Create function `treeWalker` for traverse the hierarchy :
Generate the selections for datapoints .
Create `div` for each level of hierarchy :
Create `buttons` to interact with visual and display context menu for matrix datapoints :
Clear `div` elements before render elements again :
At the final step you should get visual with context menu :
The first method to create a card is to use the report editor in Power BI Desktop .
Power BI creates a column chart with the one number .
2 . In the Visualizations pane , select the card icon .
You have now successfully created a card with the report editor . Below is the second option for creating a card using the Q &amp; A question box .
The Q &amp; A question box is another option for you to use when creating a card . The Q &amp; A question box is available in Power BI Desktop report view .
1 . Start on a blank report page
Power BI will create a card and a box for your question .

title : Configure workspace dataflow settings
# Configure workspace dataflow settings ( Preview )
There are two ways to configure the workspace dataflow storage settings :
* During creation of the workspace
* By editing an existing workspace
We &apos;ll take a look at each in the following sections .
# # Create a new workspace , configure its dataflow storage
# # Update dataflow storage for an existing workspace
# # Get the URI of stored dataflow files
* Otherwise , all data prep features are the same as for dataflows stored in Power BI storage
There are some additional considerations as well , described in the following list :
* Once a dataflow storage location is configured , it cannot be changed .
1 . Anna creates a new workspace and configures it to store dataflows in the organization ’ s data lake .
3 . Ben receives an error because Ben was not added as an authorized user to the dataflow ’ s CDM folder in the data lake .
This article provided guidance on how to configure workspace storage for dataflows . For additional information , take a look at the following articles :

title : Add a CDM folder to Power BI as a dataflow
There are a few requirements for creating dataflows from CDM folders , as the following list describes :
* You must be granted read and execute permissions on all files and folders in the CDM folder to add them to Power BI .
The following sections describe how to create a dataflow from a CDM folder .
# # Authorizing users for CDM folders to create a dataflow
In order to create a dataflow from a CDM folder the following permissions must be added :
# # Create a dataflow from a CDM folder
In the screen that appears , select to * * Create and attach * * as shown in the following image .
The following lists help clarify how dataflows from CDM folders operate with Power BI .
* Dataflows from CDM folders can &apos;t be edited
* Permissions to read a dataflow created from a CDM folder is managed by the owner of the CDM folder , and not by Power BI
* Linked entities is not available for dataflows created from CDM folders
1 . Anna creates a new workspace and configures it to store dataflows from a CDM folder .
title : Default member in multidimensional models in Power BI
# Work with multidimensional models in Power BI
# # Working with filter cards
If the default member is removed , de-selecting the value clears it for all visuals to which the filter card applies , and the values displayed do not reflect the default member .
Let &apos;s look at an example to clarify the behavior . Consider the following configuration of ARPs :
Now let &apos;s imagine the following * default members * are set for these columns :
Groups displayed in the visual have their entire ARP path cleared .
If a group is not displayed in the visual , but is part of the ARP path of another grouped-on column , the following applies :
* Not all branches of the ARP path are cleared automatically .
# # # Slicers and filter cards
When working with slicers or filter cards , the following behavior occurs :
For this table , we use the same example data used earlier in this article :
The following rules apply for how Power BI behaves in these circumstances .
* Power BI groups on that column
* The column has a filter card with * ALL * state

title : Performance Tips
# How to build a high performance Power BI visual
This article will cover techniques on how a developer can achieve high performance when rendering visuals .
No one wants a visual to take its time when rendering and squeezing every drop of performance you can out of code becomes critical when rendering .
# # Power BI visual performance tips
Here are some recommendations on how to achieve optimal visual performance .
# # # Use User Timing API
# # # Review animation loops
Does the animation loop redraw unchanged elements ?
- Problem : It wastes time to draw elements that don ’ t change from frame-to-frame .
- Solution : Update frames selectively .
When the time comes to animate static visualizations , it ’ s tempting to lump draw code into one update function and repeatedly call it with new data for each iteration of the animation loop .
Instead consider the following update pattern , use a visual constructor method to draw everything static , then the update function only needs to draw visualization elements that change .
&gt; Inefficient animation loops are commonly found in axes and legends .
# # # Cache DOM Nodes
To make sure that your code is fast and doesn ’ t slow down the browser , keep DOM access to a minimum .
# # # Avoid DOM manipulation
The above example could be quickened using `html ( ) ` and building the list beforehand :
Limiting your JS frameworks and using native JS whenever possible can increase the available bandwidth and lower your processing overhead . This can also limit compatibility issues with older browsers .
# # # Use requestAnimationFrame instead of setTimeout
title : Export data from a Power BI visual
# # From a visual on a Power BI dashboard
&gt; If you don &apos;t have permissions to the data , you won &apos;t be able to export or open in Excel .
# # From a visual in a report
You can export data from a visual in a report as .csv or .xlsx ( Excel ) format .
# Radial gauge charts in Power BI
# # When to use a radial gauge
Radial gauges are a great choice to :
* Show progress toward a goal .
* Represent a percentile measure , like a KPI .
* Show the health of a single measure .
* Display information you can quickly scan and understand .
# # Create a basic radial gauge
Notice that we &apos;ve exceeded our target .
The gauge is redrawn with a new end value , 1.21 million in gross sales .
# # # Step 5 : Save your report
# # Use manual format options to set Minimum , Maximum , and Target values
1 . Optionally , continue formatting your gauge chart .

# Remove your connection to a Power BI organizational content pack
To remove a content pack , you remove its dataset .
title : Custom layouts with Power BI embedded content
Use custom layout to embed a report with different layout than in an original report . Defining a new layout varies between defining only a page size , controlling visual sizes , or position and visibility .
pagesLayout is a map from page name to PageLayout object . Definition :
PageLayout contains a visual layout map , which maps each visual name to a visual layout object :
To define a visual layout , pass a new position and size and a new visibility state .
- `width` , height : Defines the new size of the visual .
- `displayState` : Defines the visibility of the visual .

In the example below :
# # Why don &apos;t aggregates work the way I want them to ?
# # Change how a numeric field is aggregated
Say you have a chart that sums the units sold for different products , but you &apos;d rather have the average .
1 . Your visualization is now using aggregated by average .
Some of the options that may be available for aggregating a field :
For example , this data :
Would give the following results :
Q : I &apos;m a dataset owner and I want to ensure that a field is never aggregated .
A : Try removing the field and adding it back in .
To create a dataset that grows beyond 10 GB , follow these steps :
1 . Publish the dataset to the Power BI Premium service .
In the current version of large models , enable the dataset for Premium Files storage using PowerShell cmdlets . You must have capacity admin and workspace admin privileges to run the PowerShell cmdlets .
1 . Run the following cmdlets to sign in and check the dataset storage mode .
1 . Run the following cmdlets to set the storage mode to Premium Files and check it . It can take a few seconds to convert to Premium Files .
The response should be the following . The storage mode is now set to Premium Files .
Keep in mind the following restrictions when using large models :
The following list provides regions where large models in Power BI are available . Regions not in the following list are not supported for large models :
&#124; Azure region &#124; Azure region abbreviation &#124;
&#124; Australia Southeast &#124; australiasoutheast &#124;

When Premium capacity performance issues arise , a common first approach is to optimize or tune your solutions to restore acceptable response times . The rationale being to avoid purchasing additional Premium capacity unless justified .
When additional Premium capacity is required , there are two options described in this article :
- Scale-up an existing Premium capacity
- Add a new Premium capacity
Finally , testing approaches and Premium capacity sizing conclude this article .
When trying to get the best utilization and performance , there are some recommended best practices , including :
- Using workspaces instead of personal workspaces .
- If sharing content only with Power BI Pro users , there may be no need to store the content in a dedicated capacity .
This article addresses seven common support questions , describing possible issues and explanations , and information on how to identify and resolve them .
# # # Why is the capacity slow , and what can I do ?
Having gained an understanding of the reason , you can then begin to investigate . Responses to the following six questions will help you to address more specific issues .
# # # What content is using up my capacity ?
Key metrics to monitor include :
- Average CPU and high utilization count .
- Active datasets loaded in memory .
- Average and maximum query durations .
- Average query wait times .
- Average dataset and dataflow refresh times .
The following tables show possible issues and ways to identify and handle them .
# # # # Insufficient capacity resources
&#124; Possible Explanations &#124; How to Identify &#124; How to Resolve &#124;
# # # # Inefficient report designs
# # # # Dataset is slow , especially when reports have previously performed well
# # # # High concurrent report usage
# # # Why are reports not loading ?
# # # Why are refreshes not starting on schedule ?
Scheduled refresh start times are not guaranteed . Recall that the Power BI service will always prioritize interactive operations over background operations . Refresh is a background operation that can occur when two conditions are met :
- There is sufficient memory
- The number of supported concurrent refreshes for the Premium capacity is not exceeded
When the conditions are not met , the refresh is queued until the conditions are favorable .
Recall that the supported number of maximum concurrent refreshes is set to 1.5 times the backend v-cores , rounded up .
A scheduled refresh will fail when it cannot commence before the next scheduled refresh is due to commence . An on-demand refresh triggered manually from the UI will attempt to run up to three times before failing .
# # # Why are refreshes slow ?
Refreshes can be slow - or perceived to be slow ( as the previous common question addresses ) .
When the refresh is in fact slow , it can be due to several reasons :
- Insufficient CPU ( refresh can be very CPU-intensive ) .
- Data volume - a good reason to configure incremental refresh , as discussed below .
# # # Why are data refreshes not completing ?
When the data refresh commences but fails to complete , it can be due to several reasons :
- Non-capacity reasons , including datasource system disconnection , invalid permissions or gateway error .
# # # Optimizing Power BI hosted models
Optimizing models hosted in a Premium capacity can be achieved at the datasource ( s ) and model layers .
Consider the optimization possibilities for an Import model :
At the datasource layer :
- Non-relational data sources can be pre-integrated with relational stores .
- Ensure that gateways have enough resources , preferably on dedicated machines , with sufficient network bandwidth and in close proximity to the data sources .
At the model layer :
- There may be opportunity to tune DAX expressions for measures and RLS rules , perhaps rewriting logic to avoid expensive formulas
- Incremental refresh can dramatically reduce refresh time and conserve memory and CPU . The incremental refresh can also be configured to remove historic data keeping model sizes trim .
Consider the optimization possibilities for a DirectQuery model . As the model issues query requests to the underlying datasource , datasource optimization is critical to delivering responsive model queries .
- Ensure that gateways have enough resources , preferably on dedicated machines , with sufficient network bandwidth and in close proximity to the datasource .
- Power Query query designs should preferably apply no transformations - otherwise attempt to keep transformations to an absolute minimum .
- Avoid creating Power Query query custom columns or model calculated column - materialize these in the datasource , when possible .
Consider the optimization possibilities for a Composite model . Recall that a Composite model enables a mix of import and DirectQuery tables .
- Generally , the optimization for Import and DirectQuery models apply to Composite model tables that use these storage modes .
- Ensure that gateways have enough resources , preferably on dedicated machines , with sufficient network bandwidth and in close proximity to the data sources
Over time , Capacity Admins can balance workspaces across capacities by moving content between workspaces , or workspaces between capacities , and by scaling capacities up or down . Generally , to host larger models you scale-up and for higher concurrency you scale out .
It &apos;s important that the tests are repeatable . Tests should be run several times and they should deliver approximately the same result each time . An average of these results can be used to extrapolate and estimate a workload under true production conditions .

# Automated Machine Learning in Power BI
Automated machine learning is available for dataflows that are hosted on Power BI Premium and Embedded capacities only .
# # Creating a machine learning model
This section describes how to create an AutoML model .
# # # Data prep for creating an ML model
AutoML has specific data requirements for training a machine learning model . These requirements are described in sections below , based on respective model types .
# # # Configuring the ML model inputs
A simplified experience is launched , consisting of a wizard that guides you through the process of creating the ML model . The wizard includes the following simple steps .
The outcome field identifies the label attribute for training the ML model , shown in the following image .
# # # ML model training
AutoML applies several transformations on each selected input field based on its data type , and its statistical properties . AutoML uses these transformations to extract features for use in training your ML model .
In some cases , the final model generated may use ensemble learning , where multiple models are used to deliver better predictive performance .
# # # AutoML model explainability
# # # AutoML model report
You can review the model report to understand its performance . You can also validate that the key influencers of the model align with the business insights about the known outcomes .
The charts and measures used to describe the model performance in the report depend on the model type . These performance charts and measures are described in the following sections .
Another section on this page describes the detected type of the input field and imputation method used for filling missing values . It also includes the parameters used by the final model .
# # Applying the AutoML model
After you apply the model , AutoML always keeps your predictions up-to-date whenever the dataflow is refreshed .
The output of a Binary Prediction model is a probability score , which identifies the likelihood that the target outcome will be achieved .
# # # Training a Binary Prediction model
- A minimum of 20 rows of historical data is required for each class of outcomes
# # # Binary Prediction model report
Measures , such as Precision and Recall , describe the effect of the probability threshold on the predicted outcomes . You can use the probability threshold slicer to select a threshold that achieves a balanced compromise between Precision and Recall .
# # # Applying a Binary Prediction model
The output of a Classification model is a probability score , which identifies the likelihood that a record will achieve the criteria for a given class .
# # # Training a Classification model
The input entity containing your training data for a Classification model must have a string or whole number field as the outcome field , which identifies the past known outcomes .
# # # Classification model report
The model report includes a chart that includes the breakdown of the correctly and incorrectly classified records for each known class .
A further class-specific drilldown enables an analysis of how the predictions for a known class are distributed . This shows the other classes in which records of that known class are likely to be misclassified .
The model explanation in the report also includes the top predictors for each class .
# # # Applying a classification model
To apply a Classification ML model , you must specify the entity with the input data and the output column name prefix .
The output of a Regression model is the predicted value .
# # # Training a Regression model
The input entity containing the training data for a Regression model must have a numeric field as the outcome field , which identifies the known outcome values .
- A minimum of 100 rows of historical data is required for a Regression model
# # # Regression model report
Like the other AutoML model reports , the Regression report is based on the results from applying the model to the holdout test data .
The model report includes a chart that compares the predicted values to the actual values . In this chart , the distance from the diagonal indicates the error in the prediction .
# # # Applying a regression model
To apply a Regression ML model , you must specify the entity with the input data and the output column name prefix .

title : Power BI visuals concepts
# Power BI visuals system integration
The article describes how visuals integrate with Power BI and how a user can interact with a visual in Power BI .
# # Visuals get updates from Power BI
# # Action and update patterns
Actions and subsequent updates in Power BI visuals occur in one of these three patterns :
* User interacts with a visual through Power BI .
* User interacts with the visual directly .
* A user opens the visual &apos;s properties panel .
* A user resizes the visual .
* A user applies a filter at the report , page , or visual level .
The visual gets a new update of the `options` objects when there &apos;s new data in one of the nested objects . How the update occurs depends on the data view mapping configuration of the visual .
* A user selects a data point in another visual in the report .
* A user selects a bookmark in the bookmarks panel of the report .
When a user selects a bookmark in the report &apos;s bookmarks panel , one of two actions can occur :
* Power BI calls the `update` method with a corresponding `filter` object inside the `options` object .
In either case , the visual must change its state according to the received selections or `filter` object .
# # # User interacts with the visual directly
* A user hovers the mouse over a data element .
* A user selects a URL .
* A user applies a filter through the visual .
* A user selects elements in the visual .
# # # Visual interacts with Power BI
* The event service triggers .

title : Add comments to dashboards and reports
# Add comments to a dashboard or report
# # How to use the Comments feature
If you are using a paginated report , you may only leave a general comment about your report . Support for leaving comments on individual paginated report visuals is not available .
The process for adding comments to a dashboard or report is similar . In this example , we &apos;re using a dashboard .
Here we see that the dashboard creator has already added a general comment . Anyone with access to this dashboard can see this comment .
3 . If you want to add a comment that is not part of an existing thread , enter your comment in the upper text field .
The comments for this dashboard now look like this .
# # # Get your colleagues attention by using the @ sign
- Bookmarks are not captured when you reply to a conversation . Only the first comment in a conversation creates a bookmark .
Back to &#91; visualizations for consumers &#93; ( end-user-visualizations.md )
# Work with Report view in Power BI Desktop
# # Let &apos;s take a look !
Once you &apos;ve added some data , you can add fields to a new visualization in the canvas .
&gt; Be sure to experiment with different visualization types . It &apos;s important your visualization convey information in your data clearly .
To correct the error , just replace the broken fields with the fields you want to use from the model in the report to which you pasted the visual . If you &apos;re using a custom visual , you must also import that custom visual to the destination report .
There are a few considerations to keep in mind when hiding a report page :
* You * cannot * see a hidden report page when viewing the report in the Power BI service .
* When a page is hidden , when in View mode , no view-mode navigation arrows are shown .

# View on-premises report server reports and KPIs in the Power BI mobile apps
Then in the Power BI mobile apps , connect to up to five report servers to view the Power BI reports and KPIs , organized in folders or collected as favorites .
# # Explore samples in the mobile apps without a server connection
Even if you don &apos;t have access to a Reporting Services web portal , you can still explore the features of Reporting Services mobile reports and KPIs .
# # Connect to an on-premises report server
1 . On your mobile device , open the Power BI app .
The mobile app needs to access the server in some way . There are a few ways to do that :
* Being on the same network / using VPN is the easiest way .
* Open a connection ( port ) in the firewall .
6 . Now you see the server in the Accounts pane - in this example , it is called &quot; Work server &quot; .
# # Connect to an on-premises report server in iOS or Android
Now you can view and interact with KPIs and Power BI reports stored on the report server .
&gt; Drill down and up is currently not enabled in Power BI reports on a Power BI Report Server .
* Tap a KPI to see it in focus mode .
# # View your favorite KPIs and reports
You can mark KPIs and reports as favorites on the web portal , and then view them in one convenient folder on your mobile device , along with your Power BI favorite dashboards .
Your favorite KPIs and reports from the web portal are all on this page , along with Power BI dashboards in the Power BI service :
# # Remove a connection to a report server
2 . Tap the name of the server you don &apos;t want to be connected to .
1 . You must be the owner of the ADLS storage account . This needs to be assigned at a resource level , not inherited from subscription level .
2 . The storage account must be created in the same AAD tenant as your Power BI tenant .
4 . The storage account must have the * Hierarchical Name Space * feature enabled .
The following sections walk through the steps necessary to configure your Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account in detail .
# # # Create the storage account
2 . Make sure you enable the hierarchical namespace feature
# # # Grant permissions to Power BI services
Next , you need to grant the Power BI service reader and data access roles in your created storage account . They are both built-in roles , so the steps are straightforward .
# # Allow admins to assign workspaces
That &apos;s it . The Power BI workspace admins can now assign workflows to the file system you created .
This feature is a preview feature , and its behavior may change as it approaches release . There are a few considerations and limitations to keep in mind when working with your dataflow storage :
* Creating dataflows with linked entities is only possible when they are stored in the same storage account
1 . Anna has created a new workspace and configured it to store dataflows in the organization ’ s data lake .
3 . Ben receives a similar error because Ben was not authorized to the dataflow ’ s CDM folder in the lake .
Common questions and answers include the following :
# Guidelines for Power BI visuals
# # Power BI visuals with additional purchases
You can use watermarks so that customers continue using the IAP advanced features without paying .
Watermarks can be used to showcase the full functionality of the Power BI visual , before a purchase is made .
* Watermarks may only be used on paid features that are used without a valid license .
* Watermarks are not allowed in Power BI visuals with a * free * price tag .
* Watermarks are not allowed in IAP visuals , when the user uses free features .
Context menu is the right-click menu that is displayed when the user is hovering over a visual .
All Power BI visuals should enable the context menu to bring a unified experience .
This section describes the specifications for adding commercial logos in Power BI visuals . Commercial logos are not mandatory . If added they must follow these guidelines .
&gt; * In this article , &apos; commercial logo &apos; refers to any commercial company icon as described in the pictures below .
# # # Commercial logo type
There are three types of commercial logos :
The following table describes the size considerations for Power BI visuals .
Commercial logos are only allowed in edit mode . When clicked , a commercial logo can only include the following functionality :
* Clicking the commercial logo redirects to your website .
* A marketing area which can include the the commercial logo , a visual and market ratings .
* An information area which can include information and links .
# # # Things to avoid
* Commercial logos cannot be displayed in view mode .
* An animated commercial logo can display animation for up to five seconds .
* A commercial logo with effects such as gradients or strong shadows .
When publishing a Power BI visual , consider the following recommendations in order to provide users a great experience .
# # # Visual landing page
# # # License key and token
For the user &apos;s convenience , add the license key or token related fields at the top of the format pane .

title : Troubleshoot report performance in Power BI
This article provides guidance that enables developers and administrators to troubleshoot slow report performance . It applies to Power BI reports , and also Power BI paginated reports .
Use the following flowchart to help understand the cause of slow performance , and to determine what action to take .
There are six flowchart terminators , each describing action to take :
The first consideration is to understand if the slow report is hosted on a Premium capacity .
When the report is hosted on shared capacity , it &apos;s not possible to monitor capacity health . You &apos;ll need to take a different investigative approach .
First , determine if slow performance occurs at specific times of the day or month . If it does — and many users are opening the report at these times — consider two options :
If you &apos;re unable to create a ticket either through either of these pages , then try to contact support over the phone :

title : Use gridlines and snap-to-grid in Power BI Desktop reports
# # # Using gridlines inside visuals
* Turn gridlines on or off
* Change the color of gridlines
* Adjust the stroke ( the width ) of gridlines
* Select the line style of the gridlines in the visual , such as solid , dashed , or dotted
# # Using z-order , align , and distribute
With a few selections from these gridlines , alignment , and distribution tools , your reports will look just how you want them to .
title : Separate reports from models in Power BI Desktop
# Separate reports from models in Power BI Desktop
This article is concerned with the second scenario . It provides guidance on whether a report and model should be combined into a single Power BI Desktop file .
It makes sense to separate model and report development into separate Power BI Desktop files when :
- Data modelers and report authors are different people .
- It &apos;s understood that a model will be the source for multiple reports , now or in the future .
# # # Preserve the model interface
So , manage model changes carefully . If possible , avoid the following changes :
- Modifying column data types .
- Modifying measure expressions so they return a different data type .
If you must make breaking changes to your models , we recommend you either :
title : &quot; Tutorial : Create a React-based visual for Power BI &quot;
&gt; * Set up your development environment
&gt; * Create a React visual
&gt; * Configure capabilities for the visual
&gt; * Resize the visual
&gt; * Make the visual customizable
1 . Open PowerShell and run the following command :
The command creates a folder called * ReactCircleCard * .
This basic visual represents updates count . Let &apos;s transform it to a circle card at the next step .
# # Change the visual to a circle card
This basic visual represents an updates count . Next , transform it to a circle card , which represents a measure and its title .
1 . Run the following command to install required dependencies :
1 . Import React dependencies and the component you just added .
The error on `component` should be gone .
1 . Modify the `Visual` class , as in the following code :
1 . Save the changes and run the existing code by using this command :
You can configure the capabilities of the visual .
1 . Remove all the content of `objects` key . You &apos;ll fill it in later .
Now you can bring data from the `Fields` pane into the visual settings .
# # Receive properties from Power BI
1 . To send updates to component instance , insert the following code in the `ReactCircleCard` class :
In this section , you make the component resizable . Currently , the component has fixed width and height .
Get the current size of the visual viewport from the `options` object .
1 . Add the following code to the `update` method of `visual` .
Now you can resize the viewport . The circle diameter corresponds to minimal size as width or height .

This article describes how to configure your SAP HANA data source to enable SSO from the Power BI service .
To enable SSO for SAP HANA , follow these steps :
We also recommend following these additional steps , which can yield a small performance improvement :
1 . In the gateway installation directory , find and open this configuration file : Microsoft.PowerBI.DataMovement.Pipeline.GatewayCore.dll.config .
# Expression-based titles in Power BI Desktop
Creating dynamic titles , sometimes called * expression-based titles * , is straightforward .
# # Create a field for your title
The first step in creating an expression-based title is to create a field in your model to use for the title .
You can create an expression that changes based on the filter context that the visual receives for the product &apos;s brand name . The following image shows the DAX formula for such a field .
Or you can retrieve the string from a lookup table that contains all the translations . You place that table in your model .
# # Select your field for your title
After you &apos;ve created the DAX expression for the field you create in your model , you need to apply it to your visual &apos;s title .
From that window , you can select the field that you created to use for your title .
There are a few limitations to the current implementation of expression-based titles for visuals :
* Expression-based formatting isn ’ t currently supported on Python visuals , R visuals , or the Key Influencers visual .
* Expression based titles aren &apos;t carried over when you pin a visual to a dashboard .
This article described how to create DAX expressions that turn the titles of your visuals into dynamic fields that can change as users interact with your reports . You might find the following articles useful as well .
title : &quot; Manage data sources &quot;
# # Remove a data source
You can remove a data source if you no longer use it . Removing a data source breaks any dashboards and reports that rely on that data source .
&gt; If your dataset contains multiple data sources , each data source must be added in the gateway . If one or more data sources aren &apos;t added to the gateway , you won &apos;t see the gateway as available for scheduled refresh .
You can also give users and security groups administrative access to the gateway .
# # # Add users to a data source
2 . Select the data source where you want to add users .
Remember that you need to add users to each data source that you want to grant access to . Each data source has a separate list of users . Add users to each data source separately .
# # # Remove users from a data source
# # Store encrypted credentials in the cloud
title : Power BI visuals samples
# Samples of Power BI visuals
These samples demonstrate how to harness the analytic and visual power of R visuals and R scripts .
# Refresh data from an on-premises SQL Server database
&gt; * Perform an on-demand refresh of your dataset .
&gt; * Review the refresh history to analyze the outcomes of past refresh cycles .
&gt; * Clean up resources by deleting the artifacts created in this tutorial .
The chart should now look like the following .
# # Connect a dataset to a SQL Server database
# # Configure a refresh schedule
Now follow these steps so the updated data can flow through the gateway connection to the dataset and into the reports in Power BI .
Note in the upper right corner , that Power BI is preparing to perform the requested refresh .

title : Funnel charts
# Create and use funnel charts
# # When to use a funnel chart
Funnel charts are a great choice :
* when the data is sequential and moves through at least 4 stages .
* when the number of &quot; items &quot; in the first stage is expected to be greater than the number in the final stage .
* to calculate and track conversion and retention rates .
* to reveal bottlenecks in a linear process .
* to track a shopping cart workflow .
* to track the progress and success of click-through advertising / marketing campaigns .
Funnel charts :
* Can be sorted .
* Support multiples .
* Can be highlighted and cross-filtered by other visualizations on the same report page .
* Can be used to highlight and cross-filter other visualizations on the same report page .
&gt; Watch this video to see Will create a funnel chart using the Sales and Marketing sample . Then follow the steps below the video to try it out yourself using the Opportunity Analysis PBIX sample file
# # Create a basic funnel chart
Watch this video to see Will create a funnel chart using the Sales and Marketing sample .
4 . Hovering over a bar displays a wealth of information .
* The name of the stage
* Number of opportunities currently in this stage
* Overall conversion rate ( % of Lead )
Highlighting a bar in a funnel cross-filters the other visualizations on the report page ... and vice versa . To follow along , add a few more visuals to the report page that contains the funnel chart .
# What is Power BI Premium ?
&gt; * Greater scale and performance
&gt; * Flexibility to license by capacity
&gt; * Unify self-service and enterprise BI
&gt; * Extend on-premises BI with Power BI Report Server
&gt; * Support for data residency by region ( Multi-Geo )
&gt; * Share data with anyone without purchasing a per-user license
Processing is achieved by a set number of v-cores , divided equally between backend and frontend .
The resources and limits of each Premium SKU ( and equivalently sized A SKU ) are described in the following table :
# # # How capacities function
At all times , the Power BI service makes the best use of capacity resources while not exceeding limits imposed on the capacity .
Capacity admins can also make sure a capacity is running smoothly . They can monitor capacity health right in the Admin portal or by using the Premium capacity metrics app .
Monitoring in the portal provides a quick view with high-level metrics indicating loads placed and the resources utilized by your capacity , averaged , over the past seven days .
From the app &apos;s dashboard , you can click a metric cell to open an in-depth report . Reports provide in-depth metrics and filtering capability to drill-down on the most important information you need to keep your capacities running smoothly .
The initial report load of large datasets can take a long time if it has been a while since the last time the dataset was used . A loading bar for longer-loading reports displays the load progress .
While the per-query memory and time constraints are much higher in Premium capacity , it &apos;s recommended you use filters and slicers to limit visuals to display only what is necessary .
# # Power BI Report Server
With Premium , anyone , whether they &apos;re inside or outside your organization can view your Power BI content including paginated and interactive reports without purchasing individual licenses .
When you &apos;re signed in , you see the following window indicated you &apos;ve been authenticated .
A useful design tip is to draw a transparent shape around visuals that interact with each other , so it &apos;s clear to the user that they have an interactive relationship .
&gt; An Office365Mon admin account is required to connect and load the Power BI template app .
When prompted , enter your Office365Mon admin credentials and follow the authentication process .
# Create report templates for Power BI Desktop
Power BI report templates contain the following information from the report from which they were generated :
What is * not * included in templates is the report &apos;s data .
And that &apos;s it , your Power BI report template is created in the file location you specified , with the .PBIT extension .
* Double-click on any .PBIT file to automatically launch Power BI Desktop and load the template
You might also be interested in learning about * * Query Parameters * * :
In previous lessons , we already created a content pack and a group . In this lesson , we &apos;re going to create an instance of the content pack for everyone in the group .

title : Embedded analytics capacity planning
# Capacity planning in Power BI embedded analytics
Some of the things to take into consideration when planning your capacity are :
* The data models you &apos;re using
* The number and complexity of required queries
* The hourly distribution of the usage of your application
* Data refresh rates
* Additional usage patterns that are hard to predict .
# # # Using the planning tool
When running the tool , be mindful of the existing load on your capacities and make sure not to run load tests during top usage times .
Here are some examples of how you can use the planning tool .
* Capacity administrators can get a better understanding of how many users their capacity can handle in a given time frame .
* You can see renders happening in real time on your browser .
* The load test effects are visible in the premium capacity metrics app &apos;s Datasets page . Capacity admins can use this tool to generate load , and see how that load shows up .

title : Getting started with formatting report visualizations
You can customize many elements of each visualization . The options available depend on the visual selected . Some of those options are :
* Lock aspect
and more .
1 . Change colors used in the visual
2 . Apply a style
3 . Change axis properties
4 . Add data labels
Let ’ s walk through the steps necessary to customize colors on a visualization .
Here are a few useful tips for working with colors . The numbers in the following list are also shown on the following screen , indicating where these useful elements can be accessed or changed .
# # Applying a style to a table
1 . Select a table or matrix to make it active .
1 . Select a style from the dropdown .
Even after you apply a Style , you can continue formatting properties , including color , for that visualization .
It ’ s often useful to modify the X-axis or the Y-axis . Similar to working with colors , you can modify an axis by selecting the down-arrow icon to the left of the axis you want to change , as shown in the following image .
In the example below , we &apos;ve formatted the Y axis by :
- moving the labels to the right side of the visualization
- changing the starting value to zero .
- changing the label font color to black
- increasing label font size to 12
One last formatting example before you start exploring on your own . Let &apos;s add data labels to an area chart .
Here is the * before * picture .
And , here is the * after * picture .
These are just a few of the formatting tasks that are possible . Open a report in Editing mode and have fun exploring the Formatting pane to create beautiful and informative visualizations .
For more information , see the following article :

title : Build a bar chart
It &apos;s important to define the bar chart view model first , and iterate on what &apos;s exposed to your visual as you build it .
Using static data is a great way to test your visual without data binding . Your view model won &apos;t change , even after you add data binding in a later step .
You add data binding by defining your visual capabilities in * capabilities.json * . The sample code already has a schema for you to use .
# # # Add data roles
The sample code already has data roles , but you can customize them .
- `name` is the internal name used to refer to the data role .
# # # Add conditions to DataViewMapping
Define conditions within your `dataViewMappings` to set how many fields each field well can bind . Use the data role &apos;s internal `name` to refer to each field .
# # # Define and use visualTransform
To assign colors and select them when defining individual data points , you use `IVisualHost` .
Color is exposed as one of the services available on `IVisualHost` .
# # # Add color to data points
Each data point is represented by a different color . You add color to the `BarChartDataPoint` interface .
# # # The colorPalette service
The `colorPalette` service manages the colors used in your visual . Its instance is available on `IVisualHost` .
# # # Assign color to data points
Selection lets the user interact both with your visual and other visuals .
Since each data point is unique , add selection to each data point . You add the selection property on the `BarChartDataPoint` interface .
# # # Assign selection IDs to each data point
Since you &apos;re making selections based only on the category , you only need to define selections `withCategory` .
# # # Interact with data points
You can interact with each bar of the bar chart once a selection ID is assigned to the data point . The bar chart listens to `click` events .
Use the `selectionManager` factory method on `IVisualHost` to create a selection manager for cross filtering and clearing selections .
You can toggle objects on or off in the * * Property * * pane .
# # # Define objects in capabilities
- `enableAxis` is the internal name that the `dataView` references .
- `bool` is a primitive value that is typically used with static objects , such as text boxes or switches .
# # # Define property settings
Although optional , it &apos;s best to localize most settings onto a single object for easy reference .
# # # Define and use ObjectEnumerationUtility
# # # Retrieve property values from dataView
The `visualTransform` is the ideal place to manipulate the visual &apos;s view model . To continue this pattern , retrieve the object properties from the `dataView` .
Define the default state of the property , and use `getValue` to retrieve the property from the `dataView` .
# # # Populate Property pane with enumerateObjectInstances
For each object , define the property with its current state .
# # # Control property update logic
# # # Define object in capabilities
Similar to static objects , define another object in the * capabilities.json * .
- `colorSelector` is the internal name that the `dataView` references .
- `fill` is a structural object value not associated with a primitive type .
# # # Define default color and retrieve categorical object from dataView
Each color is now associated with each category inside `dataView` . You can set each data point to its corresponding color .
Selection is required to associate the color with the data point .
After providing a selector for each property , you get the following `dataView` object array :

Any empty columns now appear in your visual with blank values .
title : Visual types in Power BI for consumers
# # List of visuals available in Power BI
Bar charts are the standard for looking at a specific value across different categories .
Multi row cards display one or more data points , one per row .
- when you have a line chart and a column chart with the same X axis .
- to compare multiple measures with different value ranges
- to illustrate the correlation between two measures in one visual
- to check whether one measure meets the target which is defined by another measure
- to conserve canvas space
Doughnut charts are similar to pie charts . They show the relationship of parts to a whole . The only difference is that the center is blank and allows space for a label or icon .
Funnels help visualize a process that has stages , and items flow sequentially from one stage to the next . One example is a sales process that starts with leads and ends with purchase fulfillment .
- show progress toward a goal
- represent a percentile measure , like a KPI
- show the health of a single measure
- display information that can be quickly scanned and understood
A Key Performance Indicator ( KPI ) is a visual cue that communicates the amount of progress made toward a measurable goal .
- to measure progress ( what am I ahead or behind on ? )
- to measure distance to a goal ( how far ahead or behind am I ? )
Line charts emphasize the overall shape of an entire series of values , usually over time .
Use a basic map to associate both categorical and quantitative information with spatial locations .
Pie charts show the relationship of parts to a whole .
Report designers can create a Power App and embed it into a Power BI report . Consumers can interact with that visual within the Power BI report .
# # # Scatter , bubble , and dot plot charts
A bubble chart replaces data points with bubbles , with the bubble size representing an additional dimension of the data .
A dot plot chart is similar to a bubble chart and scatter chart except that it can plot numerical or categorical data along the X axis . This example happens to use squares instead of circles and plots sales along the X axis .
This ensures the best combination of responsiveness , representation , and clear preservation of important points in the overall data set .
Slicers are a great choice to :
- display commonly-used or important filters on the report canvas for easier access
- make it easier to see the current filtered state without having to open a drop-down list
- filter by columns that are unneeded and hidden in the data tables
- create more focused reports by putting slicers next to important visuals
A standalone image is a graphic that has been added to a report or dashboard .
- to see and compare detailed data and exact values ( instead of visual representations )
- to display data in a tabular format
- to display numerical data by categories
Tree maps are a great choice :
- to display large amounts of hierarchical data
- when a bar chart can &apos;t effectively handle the large number of values
- to show the proportions between each part and the whole
- to show attributes using size and color coding
- to spot patterns , outliers , most-important contributors , and exceptions
Waterfall charts are a great choice :
- when you have changes for the measure across time or across different categories
- to audit the major changes contributing to the total value
- to plot your company &apos;s annual profit by showing various sources of revenue and arrive at the total profit ( or loss ) .
- to visualize how much money you make and spend each month , and the running balance for your account .

# Create and use R visuals in Power BI
# # Viewing R visuals in the Power BI service
The following image shows a Power BI dashboard with a collection of R visuals used for advanced analytics .
R visuals are created from R scripts , which could potentially contain code with security or privacy risks .
These risks mainly exist in the authoring phase when the script author run the script on their own computer .
The Power BI service applies a * sandbox * technology to protect users and the service from security risks .
# # R scripts error experience
As another example , the following image shows the error message that appears when an R script failed to run properly due to a missing R package in Azure .
The following table describes R visuals capabilities based on licensing .
R visuals in the Power BI service have a few limitations :
* Resolution - all R visuals are displayed at 72 DPI .
* R visuals respond to highlighting other visuals , but you cannot click on elements in the R visual in order to cross filter other elements .
* R visuals do not support renaming input columns . Columns will be referred to by their original name during script execution .
* R visuals currently do not print with dashboard and reports printing
* R visuals are currently not supported in the DirectQuery mode of Analysis Services
* R visuals have the ability to convert text labels into graphical elements . Doing so in the Power BI service requires the following additional step :

title : Use cascading parameters in paginated reports
# Use cascading parameters in paginated reports
There are two design scenarios for using cascading parameters . They can be effectively used to :
- Filter _ large sets _ of items
- Present _ relevant _ items
There &apos;s a requirement to develop a Reseller Profile report . The report must be designed to display information for a single reseller . It &apos;s not appropriate to have the report user enter a reseller code , as they rarely memorize them .
# # Filter large sets of items
Let &apos;s take a look at three examples to help you limit large sets of available items , like resellers . They are :
# # # Filter by related columns
Here &apos;s how you can develop the cascading parameters :
1 . Create the five report parameters , ordered in the correct sequence .
7 . For each dataset except the first , map the query parameters to the corresponding report parameters .
# # # Filter by a grouping column
In this example , the report user interacts with a report parameter to select the first letter of the reseller . A second parameter then lists resellers when the name commences with the selected letter .
# # # Filter by search pattern
In this example , the report user interacts with a report parameter to enter a search pattern . A second parameter then lists resellers when the name contains the pattern .
Here &apos;s how you can let the report users define their own pattern .
We recommend you design your reports with cascading parameters , whenever possible . It &apos;s because they :
- Provide intuitive and helpful experiences for your report users
- Are efficient , because they retrieve smaller sets of available values
Be sure to optimize your data sources by :
- Using stored procedures , whenever possible
- Adding appropriate indexes for efficient data retrieval
- Materializing column values — and even rows — to avoid expensive query-time evaluations

title : Understand star schema and the importance for Power BI
# Understand star schema and the importance for Power BI
# # Star schema relevance to Power BI models
Star schema design and many related concepts introduced in this article are highly relevant to developing Power BI models that are optimized for performance and usability .
- Dimension tables support _ filtering _ and _ grouping _
- Fact tables support _ summarization _
Lastly , it &apos;s important to understand that optimal model design is part science and part art . Sometimes you can break with good guidance when it makes sense to do so .
There are many additional concepts related to star schema design that can be applied to a Power BI model . These concepts include :
However , there are three compelling reasons for you to create measures , even for simple column-level summarizations :
If you use your imagination , you can picture the normalized tables positioned outwards from the fact table , forming a snowflake design .
When you choose to mimic a snowflake dimension design :
- Longer relationship filter propagation chains will need to be traversed , which will likely be less efficient than filters applied to a single table .
- It &apos;s not possible to create a hierarchy that spans the tables .
A non-incremental refresh of a Power BI model dimension-type table achieves the result of a Type 1 SCD . It refreshes the table data to ensure the latest values are loaded .
It &apos;s also a good design practice to include a hierarchy that allows visuals to drill down to the version level .
- With only one active relationship path between date and reseller sales , it &apos;s not possible to simultaneously filter reseller sales by different types of dates . For example , you can &apos;t produce a visual that plots order date sales by shipped sales .
Observe the following good design practices when you create model dimension-type tables for each role :
You load this query to the model as a dimension-type table . You also need to merge this query with the fact query , so the index column is loaded to the model to support the creation of a &quot; one-to-many &quot; model relationship .
For more information about star schema design or Power BI model design , see the following articles :

# Create and manage relationships in Power BI Desktop
# # Create a relationship with autodetect
# # Create a relationship manually
If you encounter that error , there are a couple ways to fix the issue :
* Add an intermediary table made of the list of distinct key values to the model , which will then be linked to both original columns in the relationship .
&gt; You can complete this lesson yourself :
So , let ’ s create a relationship between these two tables .
Remember those columns we saw in both tables with a project name , but with values that look alike ? We &apos;ll use these two columns to create a relationship between our tables .
# # # To create the new relationship
Now , let ’ s look at the table in our report canvas again .
That looks a whole lot better , doesn ’ t it ?
That was easy . In fact , with autodetect , you might not even have to do that much .
Power BI typically sets these options automatically and you won ’ t need to adjust them ; however , there are several situations where you might want to configure these options yourself .
There are three options that can be selected and enabled :
# # Future updates to the data require a different cardinality
These additional rows mean the best combination of the two tables now looks like this :
# # Adjusting Cross filter direction for a complex set of tables and relationships
Cross filtering both directions works well for a pattern of table relationships such as the pattern above . This schema is most commonly called a star schema , like this :

1 . Open a dashboard or report that you use often . Even content that has been shared with you can be a favorite .
From here , you can take action . You can open a favorite , identify owners , and even share favorites with your colleagues .
2 . Select the yellow star next to the content you want to unfavorite .
# Supported browsers for Power BI
Power BI supports these browsers on all platforms where they &apos;re available :
- Chrome desktop latest version
&gt; Power BI doesn &apos;t run in any browsers in iOS10 or previous versions .
title : Set up drill through in Power BI reports
# Set up drill through in Power BI reports
# # Set up the drill-through destination page
&gt; You can configure and perform drillthrough to a page in the same report , however , you cannot drillthrough to a page in a different report .
# # Use your own image for a back button
Because the back button is an image , you can replace the image of that visual with any image you want . It still operates as a back button so that report consumers can go back to their original page .
To use your own image for a back button , follow these steps :
Now users can right-click a data point in your report and get a context menu that supports drill through to that page .
# # Pass all filters in drill through
Although you could do this with tooltips pages , that would be an odd experience because the tooltip wouldn &apos;t appear to be working properly . For this reason , so doing so with tooltips isn &apos;t recommended .
# # Add a measure to drill through
That &apos;s all there is to using drill through in your reports . It &apos;s a great way to get an expanded view of the entity information that you selected for your drill-through filter .
After fifteen seconds or so , the notification changes to let you know that Power BI found some insights .
# Explore reports in the Power BI mobile apps
3 . Interact with the reports in the Power BI mobile apps .
# # Open a Power BI report in the mobile app
In lists and menus , you &apos;ll find an icon next to a report name , which helps you understand that the item is a report :
There are two icons for reports in the Power BI mobile apps :
Not all tiles can be opened as reports . For example , tiles that are created when you ask a question in the Q &amp; A box don &apos;t open reports when you tap them .
# # Zoom in on your data
Use the pinch gesture to zoom into your reports to examine them in greater detail . Unpinch to zoom back out again . Pinch-to-zoom is supported on Android and iOS phones and tablets .
If you prefer , you can switch to double-tap interaction . With double tap interaction , you first tap on a visual to select it , and then tap again in the visual to perform your desired action .
# # # Single-select versus multi-select mode for data point selection
To deselect a selected data point , simply tap it again .
# # # Using tap and long tap
A tap is the same as a mouse click . So , if you want to cross-highlight the report based on a data point , tap that data point .
When you tap a slicer value , the value is selected and the rest of the report is sliced by that value .
When you tap a link , button , or bookmark , the action defined by the report author will occur .
# # # Tooltip and drill actions
When you long tap ( tap and hold ) a data point , a tooltip that shows the values the data point represents will appear :
If the report author configured a report page tooltip , the default tooltip is replaced with the report page tooltip :
&gt; In the Power BI mobile apps , drill actions in matrix and table visuals are enabled through cell values only , not through column or row headers .
You can perform from these actions from the footer :
* Reset the report filter and cross-highlight selections back to their original state .
* Open the conversation pane to view comments or to add comments to the report .
* Open the filter pane to view or modify the filter currently applied to the report .
* List all pages in the report . Tapping a page name will load and present that page .
You can move between report pages by swiping from the edge of your screen to the center .
* View all report actions .
# # # # All report actions
Some of the actions might be disabled because they &apos;re dependent on the specific report capabilities .
When a bookmark view of a report is open , the name of the bookmark appears at the top of the report .
# # Configure your experience with reports
The Power BI mobile app has a number of settings that enable you to control your report experience . Currently you can configure
# Embedded analytics with Power BI
Choose the solution that is right for you :
There are two main scenarios for embedding Power BI content :
- Embedding for your users and customers without requiring Power BI licenses .
# # Embedding for your organization
# # Embedding for your customers
You can now try to embed Power BI content into an application , or try to embed Power BI content for your customers .
Here are the steps you complete in this tutorial :
&gt; * Create an Azure sample database .
&gt; * Format the report with title , page numbers , and column headings on each page .
&gt; * Upload the report to the Power BI service .
Here are the prerequisites for creating the paginated report :
Here are the prerequisites for uploading your paginated report to the Power BI service :
# # Create the matrix with a wizard
The * * Getting Started * * dialog box opens .
The * * Data Source Properties * * dialog box opens .
10 . Type the same user name and password in the box .
Let &apos;s pause for a moment to look at the results of the wizard .
1 . In the Report Data pane , you see the embedded Azure data source and the embedded dataset based on it , both of which you created .
You still don &apos;t see actual data values . You need to run the report to see them .
5 . In the Grouping pane , you see the three row groups you created in the wizard :
This matrix doesn &apos;t have any column groups .
To see the actual values , you need to run the report .
# # # Set page width
# # # Add a report title
# # # Add a page number
# # # Make the table wider
Now you can make the matrix wide enough to fill the width of the page , and make the text columns wider so the names don &apos;t scroll as much .
1 . Select the matrix , then select the Company Name column .
Now the matrix is almost as wide as the print area .
# # # Format the currency
If you noticed when you ran the report , the dollar amounts aren &apos;t formatted as currency yet .
Now you can see the values are formatted as currency .
# # # Add column headers on each page
One more formatting improvement before publishing the report to the Power BI service : making the column headers show up on each page in the report .
It &apos;s time to run the report and see how it looks now .
7 . Save the report to your computer .
# # Upload the report to the service
Now that you &apos;ve created this paginated report , it &apos;s time to upload it to the Power BI service .
If you can &apos;t turn it on , you need to ask your Power BI admin to give you permission to add the workspace to the dedicated Premium capacity .
4 . Select the report to view it .
7 . Now you can view your paginated report in the Power BI service .
# Power BI Embedded migration tool
Migrating your content from your workspace collections to the Power BI service can be done in parallel to your current solution and doesn &apos;t require any downtime .
* PBIX files imported before November 26 , 2016 will not be downloadable .
3 . You will be prompted to sign in . You will use your Azure subscription login .
4 . Select the Azure subscription which stores your Power BI Embedded workspace collections .
&gt; The analyze process could take several minutes depending on the number of Workspace collections and how much content exists in the workspace collection .
# # # Save your migration plan
You can save your migration plan for use later . This will create an XML file that contained all the information in your migration plan .
To save your migration plan , do the following .
# # # Open an existing migration plan
You can open a saved migration plan to continue working on your migration .
To open your existing migration plan , do the following .
# # Step 1 : Analyze &amp; Plan Migration
We will look at the * SampleResourceGroup * as an example .
A black color means that all reports can be downloaded .
A red color means that some reports cannot be downloaded . The left number will indicate the total number of reports that can be downloaded . The number on the right indicates the total number of reports within the grouping .
You can select an item within the PaaS topology to display the reports in the reports section .
The reports section will list out the reports available and indicates whether it can be downloaded or not .
&gt; This does not actually perform the download . This is only specifying the structure of where the reports will be downloaded to .
# # # # Upload Plan
&gt; This does not actually create the groups within the Power BI service . This only defines the naming structure for the groups .
You can right click on a group and choose to rename the group within the Upload plan directly , if desired .
# # Step 2 : Download
You have two options .
# # Step 3 : Create Groups
This will create the workspace within the Power BI service . This does not upload the reports to the workspace .
You can verify that the workspace was created by signing into Power BI and validating that the workspace exists . You will notice that nothing is in the workspace .
# # Step 4 : Upload
You can upload selected reports , or you could upload all the reports . You can also reset the upload status to re-upload items .
# # # Duplicate report names
You will need to close the migration tool to make the change and then re-open the tool and the migration plan .
In the above example , one of the cloned reports failed indicating a report with the same name existed . If we go look at the migration plan XML , we will see the following .
For the failed item , we can change the name of the SaaSTargetReportName .
We can then re-open the plan , in the migration tool , and upload the failed report .
Going back to Power BI , we can see that the reports and datasets have been uploaded in the workspace .
After you have edited the xml , re-open the plan within the migration tool and upload the report .
title : &quot; Embedded data sources for paginated reports in the Power BI service &quot;
# Create an embedded data source for paginated reports in the Power BI service
# # Create an embedded data source
1 . Specify a connection string by using one of these methods :
The data source appears in the Report Data pane .
- .rdl in same workspace as dataset ( same owner ) : Supported
- .rdl in different workspace as dataset ( same owner ) : Supported
- Shared .rdl : You need Read permission assigned for each user viewing the report at the dataset level
- Shared app : You need Read permission assigned for each user viewing the report at the dataset level
- .rdl in same workspace as dataset ( different user ) : Supported
# # # New experience apps and workspaces
- .rdl in same workspace as dataset : Supported
- .rdl in same workspace as dataset ( different user ) - Supported
- .rdl in different workspace as dataset ( different user ) : You need Read permission assigned for each user viewing the report at the dataset level
Sensitivity labels enable you to classify and help protect sensitive content , so that people in your organization can collaborate with partners outside your organization , yet still be careful and aware of sensitive content and data .
In the window that appears , select the * * Create policy * * drop-down .
From the list of options in the drop-down , select * * Session policy * * .
In the window that appears , create the session policy . The numbered steps describe settings for the following image .
When you scroll down you see more options . The following image shows those options , with additional examples .
7 . Make sure you create an alert for such an action .

title : Data retrieval guidance for paginated reports
# Data retrieval guidance for paginated reports
# # Data source types
- Better performance , as their execution plans are cached for reuse
- Reuse of stored procedures across multiple reports
# # # Analytic data sources
- Define query-level calculated members ( in MDX ) .
In general , it &apos;s best practice to retrieve only the data required by your report . So , don &apos;t retrieve columns or rows that aren &apos;t required by the report .
- Inject an expression directly into the dataset query ( using the native language of your data source ) , which results in a regular dataset field .
We recommend the latter option , whenever possible . There are two good reasons why injecting expressions directly into your dataset query is better :
If you need to combine data from multiple data sources , you have two options :
# # SQL Server complex data types
- It &apos;s possible that image data can also be retrieved from your data source ( if already stored in a table ) .
- When the images are stored on a web server , you can use a dynamic expression to create the image URL path .
# # # Deleted query fields
When a report is run , all datasets are evaluated — even if they &apos;re not bound to report objects . For this reason , be sure to remove any test or development datasets before you publish a report .
# Create date tables in Power BI Desktop
This article targets you as a data modeler working with Power BI Desktop . It describes good design practices for creating date tables in your data models .
&gt; - The date column must contain unique values .
&gt; - The date column must not contain BLANKs .
&gt; - The date column must not have any missing dates .
You can use any of several techniques to add a date table to your model :
- Power Query to connect to a date dimension table
- Power Query to generate a date table
- DAX to generate a date table
- DAX to clone an existing date table
# # Use Auto date / time
# # Generate with Power Query
You can generate a date table using Power Query . Here are two blog entries that show you how :

# How to create mobile-friendly Power BI visuals
As a developer creating Power BI visuals , the unique constraints of each mobile device must be addressed to reach as many users as possible , and provide the best mobile experience .
The following requirements are essential for mobile friendly visual development :
Interactive functionality must be provided in the same way as it &apos;s provided for desktop devices . All events handled on desktop browsers must be supported , or have comparable event handlers for mobile devices .
The following table provides a list of corresponding events on mobile devices .
&#124; Mouse event name &#124; Touch event name &#124;
The following are considered optional and used to create a better end-user experience .
The same settings can also be applied to the visuals in desktop browsers , and if needed , be overridden to adapt the visual to smaller screens .
Consider the addition of mobile specific event handlers , such as dragging and scrolling .
A visual should show a descriptive error if it cannot render on the mobile device .
# # Supported browsers and devices
When testing against the latest models of Windows , iOS , and Android devices , the developer needs to consider most of these quality aspects .
The current limitations for row-level security on cloud models are as follows :
* Only Import and DirectQuery connections are supported . Live connections to Analysis Services are handled in the on-premises model .
There &apos;s a known issue where you &apos;ll get an error message if you try to publish a previously published report from Power BI Desktop . The scenario is as follows :
You can use relational functions to build expressions that include values across multiple tables . DAX will return a result with these functions , regardless of the length of the chain of the relationship .
# Admin overview , Power BI Report Server
You need to install Power BI Report Server to start using it . We have articles that explain how to handle this task .
If you are deploying a new Power BI Report Server , you use the following document to help you .
# # Configuring your report server
title : Connect to the Regional Emergency Response Dashboard

It &apos;s best to supply the User Principal Name ( UPN ) as that &apos;s what the Power BI service and Power BI Report Server use .
The report renders based on what that user can see .
title : Deployment pipelines troubleshooting
# Deployment pipelines troubleshooting ( preview )
# # # What &apos;s deployment pipelines in Power BI
# # # How do I get started with deployment pipelines ?
# # # Why can &apos;t I see the deployment pipelines button ?
If the following conditions are not met , you &apos;ll not be able to see the deployment pipelines button .
* You belong to an organization that has Premium capacity
* A workspace can only be assigned to a single pipeline
* You &apos;re an admin of a new workspace
# # # What licenses are needed to work with deployment pipelines ?
For development and testing , you can use A or EM capacity alongside a Pro Power BI account for each user .
To assign a workspace to a pipeline , the following conditions must be met :
* You &apos;re an admin of the workspace
* The workspace is not assigned to any other pipeline
Workspaces that don &apos;t meet these conditions , are not displayed in the list of workspaces you can select from .
# # # Why did my first deployment fail ?
Your first deployment may have failed due to a number of reasons . Some of these reasons are listed in the table below .
For a comprehensive list of items and artifacts that are not supported in deployment pipelines , see the following sections :
# # # Why did my deployment fail due to broken rules ?
If your deployment was previously successful , and is suddenly failing with broken rules , it may be due to a dataset being republished . The following changes to the source dataset , result in a failed deployment :
* A removed parameter
Your dataset rules are missing values . This may have happened if your dataset changed .
To deploy successfully , fix or remove the broken rules , and redeploy .
# # # How can I change the data source in the pipeline stages ?
You can ’ t change the data source connection in Power BI service .
You can only deploy backwards to an empty stage . If you have content in the test stage , you will not be able to deploy backwards from production .
After creating the pipeline , use the development stage to develop your content , and the test stages to review and test it . You can fix bugs in these stages , and then deploy the fixed environment to the production stage .
# # # Does deployment pipelines support multi-geo ?
Multi-geo is supported . It may take longer to deploy content between stages in different geos .
# # # What is the deployment pipelines permissions model ?
# # # Who can deploy content between stages ?
# # # Which permissions do I need to configure dataset rules ?
To configure dataset rules in deployment pipelines , you must be the dataset owner .
# # # Why can &apos;t I see workspaces in the pipeline ?

# Use composite models in Power BI Desktop
The composite models capability in Power BI Desktop consists of three related features :
* Combines data from one or more DirectQuery sources .
* Combines data from DirectQuery sources and import data .
For example , by using composite models , you can build a model that combines the following types of data :
* Sales data from an enterprise data warehouse .
* Sales-target data from a departmental SQL Server database .
* Data that &apos;s imported from a spreadsheet .
&gt; Within the context of composite models , all imported tables are effectively a single source , regardless of the actual underlying data sources .
# # Example of a composite model
* Some combination of the security rules enforced in the underlying source .
* The need to be able to view the latest data .
* The sheer scale of the data .
# # Set the storage mode
The storage mode can also be viewed on the tooltip for each table .
* The encryption settings for each source should be considered . You want to avoid retrieving information from one source by an encrypted connection and then inadvertently including it in a query that &apos;s sent to another source by an unencrypted connection .
This release of composite models presents a few limitations :
When you connect to these multi-dimensional sources by using DirectQuery , you can &apos;t connect to another DirectQuery source or combine it with import data .

# About using DirectQuery in Power BI
* Guidance for when you should consider using DirectQuery rather than import
* Drawbacks of using DirectQuery
* Best practices for using DirectQuery
Follow best practices for using import versus DirectQuery :
# # Power BI connectivity modes
Power BI connects to a large number of varied data sources , encompassing :
* Visuals , or entire report pages , can be pinned as dashboard tiles . The tiles automatically refresh whenever the underlying dataset refreshes .
The situation described in the previous paragraph applies to connecting to the following sources as well , except that there &apos;s no option to import the data :
* Dashboard tiles are automatically refreshed on a schedule , such as every hour .
With these comparisons out of the way , let &apos;s focus solely on DirectQuery for the rest of this article .
* Data is changing frequently , and near real-time reporting is needed .
* Handling very large data , without the need to pre-aggregate .
* Data sovereignty restrictions apply .
# # # Performance and load on the underlying source
# # # Security implications when combining data sources
# # # Limited data transformations
* Defining relationships between tables
* Adding new calculations ( calculated columns and measures )
* Renaming and hiding columns and measures
* Defining hierarchies
* Defining the formatting , default summarization and sort order for a column
* Grouping or clustering values
# # # Behavior in the Power BI service
Similarly , editing a new report requires queries to be sent for each step on the path to produce the final visual .
There &apos;s some caching of results . The refresh of a visual is instantaneous if the exact same results have recently been obtained . If row-level security is defined , such caches aren &apos;t shared across users .
# # # # Dashboard Refresh
Pay careful consideration to the use of row-level security , and the configuring of the refresh schedule .
Some other general implications of using DirectQuery are as follows :
# # DirectQuery in the Power BI service
# # Guidance for using DirectQuery successfully
# # # Back-end data source performance
* Relationships based on integer columns generally perform better than joins on columns of other data types .
* Any necessary statistics in the source should be updated .
# # # Model Design Guidance
When defining the model , consider following this guidance :
# # # Report Design Guidance
When creating a report using a DirectQuery connection , follow this guidance :
In addition to the previous suggestions , each of the following reporting capabilities can cause performance issues :
This approach results in two queries being sent to the underlying source :
* The second query then retrieves the necessary data for the visual , including the categories that met the condition in the `WHERE` clause .
# # # Maximum number of connections option for DirectQuery
You can set the maximum number of connections DirectQuery opens for each underlying data source , which controls the number of queries concurrently sent to each data source .
The setting is only enabled when there &apos;s at least one DirectQuery source in the current report . The value applies to all DirectQuery sources , and to any new DirectQuery sources added to the same report .
This section describes how to diagnose performance issues , or how to get more detailed information to allow the reports to be optimized .
Similarly , we recommend to first try to isolate any issues to an individual visual , rather than many visuals on a page .
The trace file can be found in the * AppData * folder for the current user :
To open the trace file , take the following steps :
All events from the current session are displayed . An annotated example is shown here , which highlights groups of events . Each group has the following events :
Other columns of interest are as follows :
In the image above , some of the less interesting columns have been narrowed , to allow other columns to be seen more easily .
We recommend the following approach to capturing a trace to help diagnose a potential performance issue :
* Open a single Power BI Desktop session , to avoid the confusion of multiple workspace folders .
Consider the following query :
That query results in the following visual :
This article describes aspects of DirectQuery that are common across all data sources . There are certain details that are specific to individual sources . See the following articles covering specific sources :
For more information about DirectQuery , see the following resource :
title : Basic Area chart
# Create and use basic area charts
The basic area chart ( also known as layered area chart . ) is based on the line chart . The area between axis and line is filled with colors to indicate volume .
# # When to use a basic area chart

* to see and compare the volume trend across time series
# # Create a basic area chart
1 . These steps will help you create an area chart that displays this year &apos;s sales and last year &apos;s sales by month .
b . Convert the chart to a basic area chart by selecting the Area chart icon from the Visualizations pane .
2 . Select one of the shaded areas of the area chart and then select the other shaded area . You &apos;ll notice no impact on the other visualizations on the page .

# Set and use date tables in Power BI Desktop
# # Setting your own date table
* contains unique values
* contains no null values
* contains contiguous date values ( from beginning to end )
There are two likely scenarios for creating your own date table , either of which is a reasonable approach :
# # Marking your date table as the appropriate data type
3 . Specify the data type for your column .
# Connect to Azure Search with Power BI
4 . Provide the name of the table storage account your Azure Search analysis is stored .
# Access Power BI featured tables in Excel ( preview )
# # The Excel Data Types Gallery
# # Search for Power BI data in the Data Types Gallery
The field value or values are placed in the adjacent cells . The cell formula refers to the linked cell and the field name , so you can use the data in Excel functions .
# # # Use cell formulas
In an Excel table , you can refer to the linked table column and then add data fields using the `.` ( period ) reference .
Likewise in a cell , you can refer to the cell and use the `.` ( period ) reference to retrieve fields .
# # Data caching and refresh
The Excel Data Types Gallery and connected experiences to Power BI featured tables is only available for Excel E5 and G5 customers .
Administration audit logs show these events for featured tables :
Here are limitations for the initial preview :
- Featured tables in Power BI datasets that use the following capabilities aren &apos;t shown in Excel :
- Row-level security datasets .
- Datasets with a live connection .
- Excel shows only data in columns and calculated columns in the featured table . The following aren &apos;t provided in the initial preview :
- Measures defined on the feature table .
- Measures defined on related tables , and implicit measures calculated from relationships .
- Rows with text columns whose values exactly match “ Orange ” or “ County ” are returned .
- Rows with text columns whose values start with “ Orange ” or “ County ” are returned .
- Setting or updating the featured table is not supported in the XMLA endpoint
- Excel files with a data model can be used to publish featured tables . Load the data into Power BI desktop and then publish the featured table .
- Changing the Table name , Row Label , or Key Column the featured table may impact Excel users with linked cells to rows in the table .
title : Governance and deployment approaches
Over the last few decades , companies have become increasingly aware of the need to leverage data assets to profit from market opportunities . Either by performing competitive analysis or by understanding operational patterns , many organizations now understand they can benefit from having a data strategy as a way to stay ahead of their competition .

# Tips for authoring template apps in Power BI
* Sample data makes your app discoverable immediately after installation .
# # # Connect to your API
Power BI template apps can execute multiple queries in parallel and for multiple users concurrently . Plan ahead your throttling and concurrency strategy and ask us how to make your template app fault tolerant .
&gt; Template apps support all parameters except Any and Binary .
* Ensure all columns are typed appropriately .
* For shared logic , consider using functions or queries .
A well-defined data model ensures your customers can easily and intuitively interact with the template app . Create the data model in Power BI Desktop .
# # # Q &amp; A
# # # Additional data model tips
Make sure you &apos;ve :
* Applied formatting to all value columns . Apply types in the query .
* Applied formatting to all measures .
* Set data category , when applicable .
* Set relationships , as necessary .
* Use more than one visual per page for cross-filtering .
* Align the visuals carefully ( no overlapping ) .
* All of the aggregations presented make numeric sense ( averages , unique values ) .
* Slicing produces rational results .
* Logo is present on at least the top report .
* Elements are in the client &apos;s color scheme to the extent possible .
The dashboard is the main point of interaction with your template app for your customers . It should include an overview of the content included , especially the important metrics for your business scenario .
* Maintain the same theme when pinning so that the tiles on your dashboard are consistent .
* Pin a logo to the theme so consumers know where the pack is from .
* Suggested layout to work with most screen resolutions is 5-6 small tiles wide .
* All dashboard tiles should have appropriate titles / subtitles .
* Consider groupings in the dashboard for different scenarios , either vertically or horizontally .
Template apps , as part of the app creation stage , wraps the cache data in the workspace as part of the app :
* Allows the installer to understand the functionality and purpose of the app before connecting data .
* Creates an experience that drives the installer to further explore app capabilities , which leads to connecting the app dataset .
We recommend having quality sample data before creating the app. ensure the app report and dashboards are populated with data .
Template apps can be published on AppSource , follow these guidelines before submitting your app to AppSource :
* Make sure you create a template app with engaging sample data that can help the installer understand what the app can do ( empty report &amp; dashboard aren &apos;t approved ) .
* Have instruction for the validation team to follow which includes credentials and parameters that are required to connect to data .
* Install the app using the app link before submitting it , make sure you can connect the dataset and the app experience is as you planned .
* Before uploading pbix into the template workspace , make sure to unload any unnecessary connections .
# # Create a download link for the app
After publishing the template app on AppSource , consider creating a download link from your website to either :
* AppSource download page - can be viewed by publicly , get the link from your AppSource page .

title : Intro to datasets across workspaces
# # Dataset sharing and the new workspace experience
- In the service , when you open the dataset catalog from a new workspace experience , the dataset catalog shows datasets that are in your My Workspace and in other new workspace experience workspaces .
- When you open the dataset catalog from a classic workspace , you only see the datasets in that workspace , not the ones in other workspaces .
- When copying reports across workspaces , the target workspace needs to be a new experience workspace .
# # Build permission for datasets
The specific features and experiences built on shared dataset capabilities are licensed according to their existing scenarios . For example :
- In general , discovering and connecting to shared datasets is available to anyone – it is not a feature restricted to Premium .
- Copying reports between workspaces requires a Pro license .
- Promoting and certifying datasets requires a Pro license .
- In a classic workspace , the dataset discovery experience only shows the datasets in that workspace .
- By design , “ Publish to web ” doesn ’ t work for a report based on a shared dataset .

title : Data reduction techniques for Import modeling
# Data reduction techniques for Import modeling
- Smaller models achieve faster data refresh , resulting in lower latency reporting , higher dataset refresh throughput , and less pressure on source system and capacity resources .
- Smaller table row counts can result in faster calculation evaluations , which can deliver better overall query performance .
There are eight different data reduction techniques covered in this article . These techniques include :
Model table columns serve two main purposes :
Columns that don &apos;t serve these purposes can probably be removed . Removing columns is referred to as _ vertical filtering _ .
# # Group by and summarize
# # Optimize column data types
In this example , we recommend that you set the column Default Summarization property to &quot; Do Not Summarize &quot; . It will help to minimize the inappropriate summarization of the order number values .
# # Preference for custom columns
# # Disable Power Query query load
Power Query queries that are intended support data integration with other queries should not be loaded to the model . To avoid loading the query to the model , take care to ensure that you disable query load in these instances .
# # Disable auto date / time
# # Switch to Mixed mode

title : Configure Kerberos to use Power BI reports
# Configure Kerberos to use Power BI reports
Learn how to configure your report server for Kerberos authentication to data sources used within your Power BI reports for a distributed environment .
Specifically , you will need to configure constrained delegation . You may have Kerberos configured in your environment but it may not be configured for constrained delegation .
If your report server is not configured properly , you may receive the following error .
Within Technical details , you will see the following message .
&gt; In order to configure SPNs and delegation settings , you need to be a domain administrator .
We will need to configure , or validate , the following .
1 . Authentication type within Report Server config .
2 . SPNs for the report server service account .
5 . Delegation settings on the report server service account .
# # Authentication type within Report Server configuration
We want to make sure that RSWindowsNegotiate is listed and the first in the list of authentication types . It should look similar to the following .
If you had to change the configuration file , you will want to stop and start the report server to make sure the changes take effect .
# # SPNs for the report server service account
Next , we need to make sure that the report server has valid SPNs available . This is based on the service account that is configured for the report server .
# # # Virtual Service Account or Network Service
If your report server is configured for the Virtual Service Account or Network Service account , you should not have to do anything . These are in the context of the machine account . The machine account will have HOST SPNs by default . These will cover the HTTP service and will be used by the report server .
# # # Domain user account
&gt; You will need domain admin rights in order to create the SPN .
If your machine name is ContosoRS , your SPNs would be the following .
# # # Location of SPN
If we are using a domain user account of RSService , we would place the SPN on RSService .
# # # Using SetSPN to add the SPN
We can use the SetSPN tool to add the SPN . We will follow the same example as above with the Machine account and the domain user account .
# # SPNs for the Analysis Services service
An example of an Analysis Services SPN would look like the following .
We can use the SetSPN tool to add the SPN . For this example , the machine name will be ContosoAS .
# # SPNs for the SQL Browser service
The SPNs for SQL Browser are similar to what we did with Power BI Report Server .
You do not have to specify anything for the instance name or port .
# # Delegation settings on the report server service account
You will need to start by going to the properties of the report server service account within Active Directory Users and Computers . This will either be the machine account , if you used Virtual Service Account or Network Service , or it will be a domain user account .
# # Running a Power BI Report
After all of the above configuration is in place , your report should display properly .

# Export Power BI report to file ( preview )
The `exportToFile` API enables exporting a Power BI report by using a REST call . The following file formats are supported :
* When exporting to a .png , a report with multiple pages is compressed into a .zip file
* Each file in the .zip represents a report page
You can use the export feature in a variety of ways . Here are a couple of examples :
# # # Selecting which pages to print
For example , you can use the bookmark &apos;s `capturedBookmark.state` method to capture the changes a specific user made to a report , and then export it in its current state .
# # # Row Level Security ( RLS )
To export using RLS , you must have the following permissions :
* Write and reshare permissions for the dataset the report is connected to
* If the report resides on a v1 workspace , you need to be the workspace admin
* If the report resides on a v2 workspace , you need to be a workspace member or admin
* The report you &apos;re exporting must reside on a Premium or Embedded capacity .
* The dataset of the report you &apos;re exporting must reside on a Premium or Embedded capacity .
* Exported reports cannot exceed a file size of 250 MB .
* When exporting to .png , sensitivity labels are not supported .
* Uncertified Power BI visuals
When you create an export job , there are three steps to follow :
This section provides examples for each step .
# # # Step 1 - sending an export request
The first step is sending an export request . In this example , an export request is sent for a specific page .
# # # Step 2 - polling
After you &apos;ve sent an export request , use polling to identify when the export file you &apos;re waiting for is ready .
# # # Step 3 - getting the file
Once polling returns a URL , use this example to get the received file .
# # # Step 4 - Using the file stream
When you have the file stream , you can handle it in the way that best fits your needs . For example , you can email it or use it to download the exported reports .
This is an end-to-end example for exporting a report . This example includes the following stages :

title : Limitations of Power BI Q &amp; A
# Limitations of Power BI Q &amp; A
Power BI Q &amp; A currently has some limitations .
# # # Supported data sources
Power BI Q &amp; A supports the following configurations of data sources in the Power BI service :
In each of these configurations , row-level security is also supported .
# # # Data sources not supported
Power BI Q &amp; A currently does not support the following configurations :
- Object level security with any type of data source
- Composite models
Tenant administrators can use the tenant admin settings to manage the ability to store questions . Permissions are based on security groups .
# # Teach Q &amp; A limitations
Teach Q &amp; A allows you to fix two types of errors :
- Assign a word to a field .
- Assign a word a filter condition .
Currently we don &apos;t support redefining a recognized term or defining other types of conditions or phrases . Also , when defining filtering conditions , you can only use a limited subset of language , including :
- Products greater than 100
- Products is 100
- Products smaller than 100
# # # Statements not supported
- Using measures in conditions is currently not supported . Instead , convert measures to calculated columns to make them work .
- Multiple conditions aren &apos;t supported . As a workaround , create a DAX calculated column that evaluates a multi-condition statement Boolean and use this field instead .

# Administering Power BI in the admin portal
# # How to get to the admin portal
There are several sections in the Admin portal . The rest of this article provides information about each of these sections .
Here &apos;s a breakdown of what you can see in each tile :
* Distinct count of all dashboards , reports , and datasets in the user workspace .
* A view of your top users based on how many reports they have .
The second section shows the same type of information , but based on groups . This section lets you see which groups in your organization are most active and what kind of content they &apos;re consuming .
With this information , you can get real insights into how people are using Power BI across your organization .
Admins can also determine whether content creators can see per-user data in usage metrics .
# # # Usage metrics for content creators
# # # Per-user data in usage metrics for content creators
# # # Delete all existing usage metrics content
When disabling usage metrics for their entire organization , admins can also choose one or both options to :
Be careful , because deleting existing usage and per-user metrics content is irreversible .

title : Deprecate content packs
# DirectQuery model guidance in Power BI Desktop
While direct connect is convenient , we don &apos;t recommend that you use this approach . The main reason is that it is not possible to refresh the model structure should the underlying data source schema change .
# # Optimize data source performance
The relational database source can be optimized in several ways , as described in the following bulleted list .
A DirectQuery model can be optimized in many ways , as described in the following bulleted list .
The setting is only enabled when there &apos;s at least one DirectQuery source in the model . The value applies to all DirectQuery sources , and to any new DirectQuery sources added to the model .
Reports based on a DirectQuery dataset can be optimized in many ways , as described in the following bulleted list .
In addition to the above list of optimization techniques , each of the following reporting capabilities can contribute to performance issues :
It may result in two queries being sent to the underlying source :
- The first query will retrieve the categories meeting the condition ( Sales &gt; $ 15 million )
- The second query will then retrieve the necessary data for the visual , adding the categories that met the condition to the WHERE clause
# # Convert to a Composite Model
When delivering reports on volatile data sources , be sure to educate report users on the use of the Refresh button . Let them know also that it may be possible to see inconsistent results , and that a refresh of the report can resolve any inconsistencies on the report page .

# Use buttons in Power BI
# # Create buttons in reports
The following cards in the * * Visualizations * * pane let you adjust formatting or behavior of a button based on its three states :
# # Select the action for a button
Here are the options for button actions :
You can try or test the buttons you create for your report by using * CTRL + CLICK * on the button you want to use .
You can build a custom navigation pane , and add the navigation buttons to it . You avoid having to edit and manage bookmarks if you want to change which pages to show in your navigation pane .
Additionally , you can conditionally format the tooltip as you can do with other button types .
# # Set the navigation destination conditionally
You can use conditional formatting to set the navigation destination , based on the output of a measure . For example , you may want to save space on your report canvas by having a single button to navigate to different pages based on the user ’ s selection .
To create the example shown above , start by creating a single-column table with the names of the navigation destinations :
Then create a page navigation button and select the conditional formatting option for the destination :
Now the button can navigate to different pages , depending on the user ’ s selection .
# # # Shapes and images for navigation
Page navigation action is supported for shapes and images , not just buttons . Here ’ s an example using one of the built-in shapes :

# # What data is cached and how is privacy protected ?
The feature has some limitations :
* Object level security ( OLS ) isn &apos;t supported . Q &amp; A doesn &apos;t respect object level security and can reveal table or column names to users who don &apos;t have access to them . You should enable RLS to ensure data values are secured appropriately as well .
* Live connections are only supported with the on-premises data gateway . As a result , this feature can &apos;t be used with the personal gateway .
# Upgrade Power BI Report Server
Learn how to upgrade Power BI Report Server .
Before you upgrade a report server , it is recommended that you perform the following steps to back up your report server .
# # # Backing up the encryption keys
# # # Backing up the report server databases
# # # Backing up the configuration files
# # Upgrade the report server
# # Upgrade Power BI Desktop
# Line charts in Power BI

# Apply DAX basics in Power BI Desktop
# # What is DAX ?
# # Why is DAX so important ?
This formula includes the following syntax elements :
When trying to understand a DAX formula , it &apos;s often helpful to break down each of the elements into a language you think and speak every day . For example , you can read this formula as :
Let ’ s create a simple formula . This task will help you further understand formula syntax and how the suggestions feature in the formula bar can help you .
Next , we &apos;ll pass an argument to the SUM function .
This is the first expression argument for our CALCULATE function .
You ’ ll use the PREVIOUSQUARTER time intelligence function to filter SUM results by the previous quarter .
Your formula should now look like this :
You were just introduced to several important aspects of DAX formulas :
1 . What does this button on the formula bar do ?
2 . What always surrounds a column name in a DAX formula ?
Answers are provided at the end of this article .
* A DAX function always references a complete column or a table . If you want to use only particular values from a table or column , you can add filters to the formula .
* DAX includes a variety of time intelligence functions . These functions let you define or select date ranges , and perform dynamic calculations based on them . For example , you can compare sums across parallel periods .
1 . What does a function always reference ?
2 . Can a formula contain more than one function ?
3 . What category of functions would you use to concatenate two text strings into one string ?
Row context is most easily thought of as the current row . It applies whenever a formula has a function that applies filters to identify a single row in a table . The function will inherently apply a row context for each row of the table over which it is filtering . This type of row context most often applies to measures .
Filter context is a little more difficult to understand than row context . You can most easily think of filter context as : One or more filters applied in a calculation that determines a result or value .
To better understand this formula , we can break it down , much like with other formulas .
1 . What are the two types of context ?
2 . What is filter context ?
3 . What is row context ?
1 . Validates and enters the measure into the model .
1 . A table and a column .
2 . Yes . A formula can contain up to 64 nested functions .
1 . Row context and filter context .
2 . One or more filters in a calculation that determines a single value .
3 . The current row .

# What are paginated reports in Power BI Premium ?
Paginated reports often have many pages . For example , this report has 563 pages . Each page is laid out exactly , with one page per invoice , and repeating headers and footers .
# # Compare Power BI reports and paginated reports
Now say you place the same table in a paginated report . When you print it or export it to PDF , the paginated report has as many pages as necessary to print every row in that table .
# # Report from a variety of data sources
# # # Create paginated reports with matrix , chart , and free-form layouts
# # # Add more to your report
# # Creating a report definition
# # Create a subscription to your report
Here are some other features that aren &apos;t supported in the initial release :
- Drillthrough reports . Consider using URL parameters with paginated reports for drillthrough scenarios .
- Shared data sources and shared datasets .
title : Add bookmark support for Power BI visuals
# Add bookmark support for Power BI visuals
With Power BI report bookmarks , you can capture a configured view of a report page , the selection state , and the filtering state of the visual . But it requires additional action from the Power BI visuals side to support the bookmark and react correctly to changes .
# # Report bookmarks support in your visual
If your visual interacts with other visuals , selects data points , or filters other visuals , you need to restore the state from properties .
Let &apos;s consider the following scenario : you want to create several bookmarks on the report page , with a different selection state in each bookmark .
It happens repeatedly as you change the selection and add new bookmarks . After you create the bookmarks , you can switch between them .
# # # Visuals with Selection
# # # # Use ISelectionManager.registerOnSelectCallback
When you select a bookmark , Power BI calls the `callback` method of the visual with the corresponding selections .
And `datapoints` looks like :
You now have `visualDataPoints` as your data points and the `ids` array passed to the `callback` function .
At this point , the visual should compare the `ISelectionId &#91; &#93; ` array with the selections in your `visualDataPoints` array and mark the corresponding data points as selected .
# # # Use InteractivityService for control selections in the visual
If your visual uses `InteractivityService` , you don &apos;t need any additional actions to support the bookmarks in your visual .
When you select bookmarks , the utility handles the visual &apos;s selection state .
The visual creates an advanced filter and calls the host method `applyJsonFilter` to filter data by the relevant conditions .
The target is the table that &apos;s used for filtering .
Each time you select a bookmark , the custom visual gets an `update` call .
The custom visual should check the filter in the object :
If the `filter` object isn &apos;t null , the visual should restore the filter conditions from the object :
The Timeline Slicer visual changes the range selector to the corresponding data ranges .
# # # Filter the state to save visual properties in bookmarks
The `filterState` property makes a property of a part of filtering . The visual can store a variety of values in bookmarks .
For example , the Timeline Slicer stores the `Granularity` property values in a filter . It allows the current granularity to change as you change the bookmarks .
title : Introduction to use SVG utils in Power BI visual

# Group visuals in Power BI Desktop reports
# # Hide and show visuals or groups
# # Selecting visuals within a group
There are a few ways to navigate and select items within a group of visuals . The following list describes the behavior :
* Clicking on empty space within a group ( such as white space between visuals ) does not select anything
* Clicking a visual within a group selects the entire group , a second click selects the individual visual
* Selecting two groups , then right-clicking displays an option to merge the selected groups , rather than nesting them
Once you apply a background color , clicking on the space between visuals in the group selects the group ( compare this to clicking on the white space between visuals in a group , which does not select the group ) .
For more information about grouping , take a look at the following video :

Your manager wants to see a report on your latest sales figures . They &apos;ve requested an executive summary of :
- Which month and year had the most profit ?
- Which product and segment should the company continue to invest in ?
Using our sample finance workbook , we can build this report in no time . Here ’ s what the final report will look like . Let ’ s get started !
&gt; * Download sample data
&gt; * Prepare your data with a few transformations
&gt; * Build a report with a title , three visuals , and a slicer
&gt; * Publish your report to the Power BI service so you can share it with your colleagues
To follow along , you need to download the sample workbook .
We also want to make the segments easier to see in the chart later . Let ’ s format the Segment column .
We know the Montana product was discontinued last month , so we want to filter this data from our report to avoid confusion .
2 . Select the check mark to commit .
Let ’ s build the final report , one visual at a time .
1 . Select the text you typed . Set the font size to 20 and bold .
1 . Resize the box to fit on one line .
Now , you create a line chart to see which month and year had the highest profit .
Power BI updates the column chart to show profit for each month .
Now you can easily see that December 2014 had the most profit .
Europe seems to be doing better than North America .
# # # Visual 4 : Sales by Product and Segment
Create a bar chart to determine which companies and segments to invest in .
1 . Select a blank area in the lower half of your report canvas .
Power BI automatically creates a clustered column chart .
1 . Drag the chart so it &apos;s wide enough to fill the space under the two upper charts .
Looks like the company should continue to invest in the Paseo product and target the Small Business and Government segments .
# # # Visual 5 : Year slicer
Slicers are a valuable tool for filtering the visuals on a report page to a specific selection . In this case , we can create a slicer to narrow in on performance for each month and year .
4 . Expand each year and resize the visual , so all months are visible .
Now if your manager asks to see just 2013 data , you can use the slicer to switch between years , or specific months of each year .
# # # Extra credit : Format the report
If you want to do some light formatting on this report to add more polish , here are a few easy steps .
* * Add a background shape for the title * *
Here &apos;s how your final polished report will look :
In summary , this report answers your manager ’ s top questions :
In Europe , specifically France and Germany .
The company should continue to invest in the Paseo product and target the Small Business and Government segments .
# # Publish to the Power BI service to share
Your completed report opens in the browser .
title : Power BI licensing for users in your organization
# Licensing the Power BI service for users in your organization
# # Who can purchase and assign licenses ?
&#124; Who can purchase services and licenses ? &#124; Who can manage user licenses ? &#124;
&#124; Billing administrator &#124; License administrator &#124;
# # Get Power BI for your organization
1 . Enter the number of licenses needed to cover all your users .
# # License types and capabilities
There are two kinds of Power BI subscriptions for organizations : standard and premium .
- The ability to share content with external users must be enabled
- The guest user must have the proper licensing in place to view the shared content
# # Purchase Power BI Pro licenses
# # # Power BI Pro license expiration

# Get notifications in the Power BI mobile apps
# # View notifications on your mobile device
Notifications are displayed with the most recent on top and unread messages highlighted . Notifications are retained for 90 days unless you delete them or reach the maximum limit of 100 .
# # Change or turn off notifications on your mobile device
You can change how Power BI notifies you .
3 . Here you can turn notifications off completely or choose which notifications you want .
title : Use R in Power Query Editor
# Use R in Power Query Editor
* Prepare data models .
* Create reports .
To install the mice library :
2 . Run the install command from the R prompt :
# # Use R in Power Query Editor
To demonstrate using R in Power Query Editor , we &apos;ll use an example stock market dataset contained in a .csv file and work through the following steps :
&gt; You might need to overwrite a variable named * output * to properly create the new dataset with the filters applied .
With just five lines of R script , Power Query Editor filled in the missing values with a predictive model .
# # Create visuals from R script data
We can now create a visual to see how the R script code with the mice library completes the missing values .
After you &apos;ve uploaded the .pbix file to the Power BI service , you need to take additional steps to enable service data refresh and updated visuals :
There are some limitations to queries that include R scripts created in Power Query Editor :
There are all sorts of things you can do with R and custom queries . Explore and shape your data just the way you want it to appear .
title : Install and distribute template apps in your organization - Power BI
# Install and distribute template apps in your organization
To install , customize , and distribute a template app , you need :
* Permissions to install template apps on your tenant .
* A valid installation link for the app , which you get either from AppSource or from the app creator .
# # Install a template app
When the installation finishes successfully , a notification tells you that your new app is ready .
In the example below , connecting to data involves two dialogs .
# # Customize and share the app
# # Update a template app
If you originally downloaded the app from AppSource , when a new version of the template app becomes available , you get notified in two ways :
* An update banner appears in the Power BI service informing you that a new app version is available .
* You receive a notification in Power BI &apos;s notification pane .
* Overwriting never deletes new reports or dashboards you &apos;ve added to the workspace . It only overwrites the original reports and dashboards with changes from the original author .
title : Connect to files in OneDrive for a Power BI workspace
# Connect to files stored in OneDrive for your Power BI workspace
Adding files to your workspace is a two-step process :
# # 2 Import Excel files as datasets or as Excel Online workbooks
# # # Import or connect to the files in your workspace
title : Distribute content to external guest users with Azure AD B2B
# Distribute Power BI content to external guest users with Azure AD B2B
# # Who can you invite ?
Guest users only require invitations the first time you invite them to your organization . To invite users , use planned or ad hoc invites .
To use ad hoc invites , use the following capabilities :
* Report and Dashboard sharing
Use a planned invite if you know which users to invite . The Azure portal or PowerShell enables you to send the invites . You must be assigned the user admin role to invite people .
Follow these steps to send an invite in the Azure portal .
# # # Ad hoc invites
The guest user gets an email indicating that you shared the app with them .
# # # Guest user brings their own Power BI Pro license
The guest user may already have a Power BI Pro license that was assigned to them through their own organization .
# # Guest users who can edit and manage content
To help allowed guests sign in to Power BI , provide them with the Tenant URL . To find the tenant URL , follow these steps .
* Direct publishing from Power BI desktop to the Power BI service
* Guest users can &apos;t use Power BI desktop to connect to service datasets in the Power BI service
* Classic workspaces tied to Microsoft 365 Groups
* Guest users can &apos;t create or be Admins of these workspaces
* Guest users can be members
* Sending ad hoc invites isn &apos;t supported for workspace access lists
* Guest users can &apos;t install a Power BI Gateway and connect it to your organization
* Guest users can &apos;t install apps publish to the entire organization
* Guest users can &apos;t use , create , update , or install organizational content packs
* Guest users can &apos;t use Analyze in Excel
* Guest users can &apos;t be @ mentioned in commenting
* Guest users can &apos;t use subscriptions
* Guest users who use this capability should have a work or school account
* Guest users using social identities will experience more limitations because of sign-in restrictions .
* They can use consumption experiences in the Power BI service through a web browser
* They can &apos;t use the Power BI Mobile apps
* They won &apos;t be able to sign in where a work or school account is required

Considerations and limitations
title : Code snippets for migrating content from Power BI Embedded
# Code snippets for migrating content from Power BI Workspace Collection
Make sure you are using the following namespaces to execute the code snippets below .
# # Export report from PaaS workspace
# # Import report to SaaS workspace
# # Extract DirectQuery connection string from PaaS report
This is for updating the PBIX after migrating to SaaS .
# # Update DirectQuery connection string is SaaS workspace
# # Set DirectQuery credentials in SaaS workspace
In this snippet , we are using unencrypted credentials for simplicity , sending encrypted credentials is supported as well .
# # Push dataset and report
You will need to rebuild the report for the created dataset .
# Power BI for Microsoft Azure users
title : What can I do with the Power BI API
# What can developers do with the Power BI API ?
Here are some of the things you can do with the Power BI APIs .
&gt; The Power BI APIs still refer to workspaces as groups . Any references to groups mean that you are working with workspaces .
# # API Developer tools
# # Push data into Power BI
# Azure SQL Database with DirectQuery
&gt; This description assumes that Azure SQL database is not behind a VNET or has private link endpoint enabled .
* Specify the fully qualified server name when connecting ( see below for more details ) .
* Every action such as selecting a column or adding a filter will send a query back to the database .
* Tiles are refreshed every hour ( refresh does not need to be scheduled ) . You can adjust how often to refresh in the Advanced settings when you connect .
* Q &amp; A is not available for DirectQuery datasets .
* Schema changes are not picked up automatically .
These restrictions and notes may change as we continue to improve the experiences . The steps to connect are detailed below .
You can find your fully qualified server name and database name in the Azure portal .
title : Accessing shared datasets as OData feeds in Power BI Report Server
# Accessing shared datasets as OData feeds in Power BI Report Server
You can access shared datasets from Power BI Desktop with an OData feed .
1 . With the OData feed URL , you connect to the OData source .
3 . Now you can use the data in designing reports .
title : PowerShell cmdlets , REST APIs , and .NET Client libraries for administrators
# PowerShell cmdlets , REST APIs , and .NET Client library for Power BI administration
# # Enabling the XMLA endpoint
Here are a couple things to try :
# # Establishing a client connection
# # # Connecting with a service principal
To use a service principal , be sure to specify the application identity information in the connection string as :
If you receive the following error :
Make sure you specify the tenant ID together with the app ID using the correct format .
# # # New project from an existing dataset
# # # Supported data providers
At the 1500 compatibility level , Power BI supports the following data source types :
- Provider data sources ( legacy with a connection string in the model metadata ) .
- Structured data sources ( introduced with the 1400 compatibility level ) .
# # # Cross-referencing partition sources
# # # Data sources and impersonation
# # # Overrides in Refresh TMSL command
&#91; Dataset connectivity with the XMLA endpoint &#93; ( service-premium-connect-tools.md )
title : Deployment pipelines process
# Understand the deployment process ( preview )
The deployment process lets you clone content from one stage in the pipeline to another , typically from development to test , and from test to production .
# # Deploying content to an empty stage
You can also deploy content backwards , from a later stage in the deployment pipeline , to an earlier one .
# # # Creating a Premium capacity workspace
During first-time deployment , deployment pipelines checks if you have Premium capacity permissions .
If you have capacity permissions , the content of the workspace is copied to the stage you &apos;re deploying to , and a new workspace for that stage is created on the Premium capacity .
# # # Workspace and content ownership
The deploying user automatically becomes the dataset owner of the cloned datasets , and the only admin of the new workspace .
# # Deploy content to an existing workspace
Deploying content in a working production pipeline , to a stage that has an existing workspace , includes the following :
* Deploying new content as an addition , to a stage that already contains content .
* New content deployed to replace old content , in a current working stage .
# # # Refreshing the dataset
Data in the target dataset is kept when possible . If there are no changes to a dataset , the data is kept as it was before the deployment .
# # # Requirements for deploying to a stage with an existing workspace
* An owner of all the datasets in the target workspace that are about to be deployed .
When you deploy content from one pipeline stage to another , the copied content contains the following Power BI items :
Deployment pipelines doesn &apos;t support the following items :
* Datasets that do not originate from a .pbix
* Reports based on unsupported datasets
* The workspace cannot use a template app
* PUSH datasets
# # Item properties copied during deployment
During deployment , the following item properties are copied and overwrite the item properties at the target stage :
* Report visuals ​
# # # Item properties that are not copied
The following item properties are not copied during deployment :
* Data - Data isn &apos;t being copied , only metadata is copied
* Permissions - For a workspace or a specific item
* Workspace settings - Each stage has its own workspace
The following dataset properties are also not copied during deployment :
* Refresh schedule
* Data source credentials
* Query caching settings ( can be inherited from the capacity )
* Endorsement settings
# # Deploying Power BI apps
In the production stage , the main action button on the bottom-left corner opens the update app page in Power BI , so that any content updates become available to app users .
&gt; The deployment process does not include updating the app content or settings . To apply changes to content or settings , you need to manually update the app in the required pipeline stage .
# # # User with pipeline access
Users with pipeline access have the following permissions :
* View the pipeline ​
* Share the pipeline with others
* Edit and delete the pipeline
&gt; Pipeline access doesn &apos;t grant permissions to view or take actions on the workspace content .
Workspace viewers that have * pipeline access * , can also do the following :
* Consume content
&gt; Workspace viewers cannot access the dataset or edit workspace content .
Workspace contributors that have * pipeline access * , can also do the following :
* Compare stages
* View datasets
Workspace members that have * pipeline access * , can also do the following :
* View workspace content ​
* Deploy reports and dashboards
* Remove workspaces
* Assign workspaces
Dataset owners that are either workspace members or admins , can also do the following :
* Update datasets
* Configure rules
&gt; This section describes user permissions in deployment pipelines . The permissions listed in this section may have different applications in other Power BI features .
This section lists most of the limitations in deployment pipelines .
* The maximum number of Power BI items that can be deployed in a single deployment is 300 .
* Datasets that use real-time data connectivity cannot be deployed .
* After deployment , downloading a dataset ( from the stage its been deployed to ) is not supported .
title : Introduction to use tooltip utils in Power BI visual
This article will help you to install , import , and use tooltip utils . This util useful for any tooltip customization in Power BI visuals .
To use the package , you should have the following things :
This command installs the package and adds a package as a dependency to your ```package.json```
&gt; The Usage Guide describes a public API of the package . You will find a description and a few examples for each public interface of the package .
`TooltipServiceWrapper` provides the simplest way in order to manipulate tooltips .
This module provides the following interface and function :
This function creates an instance of ITooltipServiceWrapper .
This interface describes public methods of the TooltipService .
This method adds tooltips to the current selection .
This method hides the tooltip .
Now tooltip utils has ability to handle several touch events useful for mobile development .
This method returns touch start event name .
This method returns is current touchStart event related to pointer or not .
In this view , you see all the workspace artifacts and how the data flows from one artifact to another .
On datasets and dataflows , you see the last refresh time , as well as if the dataset or dataflow is certified or promoted .
If a report in the workspace is built on a dataset or a dataflow that is located in another workspace , you see the source workspace name on the card of that dataset or dataflow . Select the name of the source workspace to go to that workspace .
# # Show lineage for any artifact
Say you want to see the lineage for a specific artifact .
* Select the double arrows under the artifact .
Power BI highlights all the artifacts related to that artifact , and dims the rest .
# # Navigation and full screen
Lineage view is an interactive canvas . You can use the mouse and touchpad to navigate in the canvas , as well as to zoom in or out .
* To zoom in and out , use either the menu in the bottom-right corner or your mouse or touchpad .
* To have more room for the graph itself , use the full screen option at the bottom-right corner .
* You need a Power BI Pro license to see lineage view .
* Lineage view is available only to users with access to the workspace .
Let ’ s take a look at these basic building blocks , discuss some simple things that can be built with them , then provide a glimpse into how complex things can be created as well .
The basic building blocks in Power BI are the following :
You can have a simple dataset based on a single table from Excel workbook , similar to what ’ s shown in the following image .
Once you have a dataset , you can begin creating visualizations that display different portions of that dataset in different ways , and with what you see , gain insights . That ’ s where reports come in .
Reports let you create many visualizations , on multiple different pages if necessary , and lets you arrange them in whatever way best tells your story .
Those are the basics of Power BI , and its building blocks . Let ’ s take a moment to review .
For some people , using a single Excel table in a dataset , then sharing a dashboard with their team , will be an incredibly valuable way to use Power BI .
Now , let &apos;s see how this works . We &apos;ll start by taking a quick look at the Power BI service .
# What to do if purchasing Power BI Pro is disabled
# Pause and start your Power BI Embedded capacity in the Azure portal
Pausing your capacity prevents you from being billed . Pausing your capacity is great if you do not need to use the capacity for a period of time . Use the following steps to pause your capacity .
&gt; Pausing a capacity may prevent content from being available within Power BI . Make sure to unassign workspaces from your capacity before pausing to prevent interruption .
3 . Select the capacity you want to pause .
Resume usage by starting your capacity . Starting your capacity also resumes billing .
3 . Select the capacity you want to start .
If any content is assigned to this capacity , it is available once started .
title : Understand Power BI Desktop privacy levels
With privacy level settings , you can specify an isolation level that defines the degree that one data source must be isolated from other data sources .
&#124; Setting &#124; Description &#124; Example Data Sources &#124;
* * Configure Privacy Levels * *
Have fun - there &apos;s a lot to learn here !
# # Introduction to visuals in Power BI
Visualizing data is one of the core parts of Power BI - a basic building block as we defined it earlier in this course - and creating visuals is the easiest way to find and share your insights .
title : &quot; Supported data sources for Power BI paginated reports &quot;
# Supported data sources for Power BI paginated reports
Paginated reports natively support the following list of data sources :
For Azure SQL Database data sources , here are the supported authentication types :
# Expressions in Power BI Report Builder
When you preview the report , the report processor combines the table data region with the actual data from the data connection and displays a row in the table for every row in the result set .
The following figure shows typical simple and complex expressions for both text boxes and placeholder text .
To display sample values instead of text for expressions , apply formatting to the text box or placeholder text . The following figure shows the report design surface toggled to show sample values :
&#124; Item &#124; Display text example &#124; Expression text example &#124;
The following table lists the kinds of references you can include in an expression :
- For the value for a Font property , the value must evaluate to the name of a font .
Publishing your reports to the Power BI service is fast and easy .
# Connect to SAP HANA data sources by using DirectQuery in Power BI
The two approaches constitute different behavior , and it &apos;s not possible to switch an existing report from one approach to the other .
Let &apos;s look at more detail about each of these two approaches , in turn .
When connecting to SAP HANA as a multi-dimensional source , the following considerations apply :
* All the measures , hierarchies , and attributes of the selected view will be displayed in the field list .
* The resulting queries are efficient
All of these considerations and behaviors necessitate the following important considerations when using DirectQuery over SAP HANA :
Again , this is due to the limitations imposed by the SQL interface .
# # Connect to LinkedIn Sales Navigator
You &apos;ll be advised that you &apos;re connecting to a third-party connecter that &apos;s still under development .
You can download the PBIX file from the following location :
# # Using the LinkedIn Sales Navigator template app
The template app provides four tabs to help analyze and share your information :
The * * Search * * tab lets you drill deeper into your search results :
Once the data updates , you can see the app populated with your own data .
# # Support for SAP BW features
- The table storage mode is Import
- The column data type is date or date / time
- The column isn &apos;t the &quot; many &quot; side of a model relationship
If it were possible to see the rows of an auto date / time table , they would look like this :
The table also defines a hierarchy , providing visuals with a drill down path through year , quarter , month , and day levels .
If it were possible to see an auto date / time table in the Model view diagram , it would look like this ( related columns are highlighted ) :
# # Work with auto date / time
In Power BI Desktop , a valid measure expression could read :
# # Configure auto date / time option
# Connect to SAP HANA databases in Power BI Desktop
When you connect to a SAP HANA database , specify the server name . Then from the dropdown and input box , specify the port .
# # Supported features for SAP HANA
This release has many capabilities for SAP HANA , as shown in the following list :
* With SAP HANA , you can also use the direct SQL feature to connect to Row and Column Tables .
* Power BI supports SAP HANA Variables and Input parameters .
* There are currently some limitations for HANA variables attached to HDI-based Calculation Views . These limitations are because of errors on the HANA side .
# # Limitations of SAP HANA
There are also a few limitations to using SAP HANA , shown below :
* NVARCHAR strings are truncated to a maximum length of 4000 Unicode characters .
* Valid Dates are between 1899 / 12 / 30 and 9999 / 12 / 31 .

title : Optimize visual colors in Power BI reports
# Tips to optimize visual colors in Power BI reports
This article targets you as a report author designing Power BI reports , configuring visual colors .
Watch the video demonstrating the top eight tips to optimize visual colors in your Power BI reports .
In summary , the top eight tips to optimize visual colors in Power BI reports include :
1 . Apply contrast within visuals
1 . Implement optimal color palettes
1 . Highlight important data with color
1 . Consider color vision deficiencies
1 . Use color with purpose
1 . Choose appropriate color scales
1 . Use color to differentiate key elements
1 . Distinguish color and data
title : &quot; DAX : Avoid converting BLANKs to values &quot;
# DAX : Avoid converting BLANKs to values
Consider the following measure definition that explicitly converts BLANK results to zero .
Consider another measure definition that also converts BLANK results to zero .
These measure designs are inefficient and lead to poor report designs .
Also , too many groupings often overwhelm your report users .
The table visual now displays only customers who have made sales within the current filter context . The improved measure results in a more efficient and practical experience for your report users .
We recommend that your measures return BLANK when a meaningful value cannot be returned .

Launching a Python IDE directly from Power BI Desktop has a few limitations :
# Query overview in Power BI Desktop
But first , let &apos;s see get acquainted with Power Query Editor .
With no data connections , Power Query Editor appears as a blank pane , ready for data .
Once a query is loaded , Power Query Editor view becomes more interesting . If we connect to the following Web data source , Power Query Editor loads information about the data , which you can then begin to shape :
Here &apos;s how Power Query Editor appears once a data connection is established :
1 . In the ribbon , many buttons are now active to interact with the data in the query .
3 . In the center pane , data from the selected query is displayed and available for shaping .
We &apos;ll look at each of these four areas : the ribbon , the Queries pane , the Data view , and the Query Settings pane .
# # The query ribbon
The * * Home * * tab contains the common query tasks .
* Adding or removing columns
* Changing data types
* Splitting columns
* Other data-driven tasks
It &apos;s useful to know that many of the tasks available from the ribbon are also available by right-clicking a column , or other data , in the center pane .
# # The center ( Data ) pane
# # The right ( Query Settings ) pane

title : Create a QR code for a report to use in Power BI mobile apps
# # Create a QR code for a report
1 . Open a report in the Power BI service .
3 . A dialog box with the QR code appears .
4 . From here you can scan the QR code or download and save it so you can :
The JPG file has the same name as the tile . For example , &quot; Sales and Marketing Sample.jpg &quot; .
1 . Print the file at 100 % or “ actual size ” .
2 . Cut out the QR code along its edge and glue it to a place relevant to the report .
title : Use and manage aggregations in Power BI Desktop
# Use aggregations in Power BI Desktop
Some advantages of using aggregations include :
# # Create an aggregated table
To create an aggregated table :
1 . Set up a new table with the fields you want , depending on your data source and model .
- Count table rows
The * * Manage aggregations * * dialog enforces the following notable validations :
Most of the validations are enforced by disabling dropdown values and showing explanatory text in the tooltip , as shown in the following image .
# # # Aggregation tables are hidden
# # # RLS for aggregations
To work correctly for aggregations , RLS expressions should filter both the aggregation table and the detail table .
# # Aggregation based on relationships
The following image shows this model .
# # # Strong vs. weak relationships
Aggregation hits based on relationships require strong relationships .
Strong relationships include the following storage mode combinations , where both tables are from a single source :
The only case where a * cross-source * relationship is considered strong is if both tables are set to Import . Many-to-many relationships are always considered weak .
# # # Relationship-based aggregation query examples
# # Aggregation based on GroupBy columns
# # # GroupBy aggregation query example
# # # Combined aggregation query examples
Aggregation precedence allows multiple aggregation tables to be considered by a single subquery .
The memory footprint of this model is relatively small , but it unlocks a huge dataset . It represents a balanced architecture because it spreads the query load across components of the architecture , utilizing them based on their strengths .
# # Detect whether queries hit or miss aggregations
The following JSON snippet shows an example of the output of the event when an aggregation is used .
# # Keep caches in sync

1 . We performed the previous step for both Web service and Web portal section and got the URLs registered on the report server Configuration Manager :
2 . In Azure portal we see two IP addresses for the VM in the networking section
The Public IP address is used for access from outside the virtual machine .
5 . The Web service and Web portal URLs should be accessible successfully after making the above-mentioned changes .
7 . Add the following registry entry :
After that , we can access the URLs on the server as well .
# # Configure Power BI Report Server to work with Kerberos
# # # 1 . Configure the authentication type
Open the command prompt as an administrator and perform the following steps .
# # # 3 . Configure delegation settings
We have to configure the delegation settings on the report server service account .
1 . Open Active Directory Users and Computers .
2 . Open the Properties of the report server service account within Active Directory Users and Computers .
3 . We want to configure constrained delegation with protocol transiting . With constrained delegation , we need to be explicit about which services we want to delegate to .
It begins with MSSQLSVC .
1 . Add the SPNs .
These steps help configure Power BI Report Server to work with Kerberos authentication mechanism and get the test connection to data source working on your local machine .
# # Configure Azure Application Proxy connector
We installed Application Proxy connector on Power BI Report Server , but you can configure it on a separate server and make sure that delegation is set up properly .
# # # Ensure the Connector is trusted for delegation
Ensure the Connector is trusted for delegation to the SPN added to the report server application pool account .
To configure KCD , repeat the following steps for each connector machine .
2 . Find the computer that the connector is running on .
# # Publish through Azure AD Application Proxy
Now you &apos;re ready to configure Azure AD Application Proxy .
# # # Configure single sign-on
Once your app is published , configure the single sign-on settings with the following steps :
- Try running a report or perform test connection to data source so that a Kerberos ticket gets created .
# # # Finish setting up your application
1 . We first have to configure the custom domain that we are planning to use in the login , then make sure it is verified
These previous steps are applicable if you have on-premises AD configured and are planning to sync it with Azure AD .
Successful sign-in after implementing the above steps :
Followed by the display of web portal :
With a successful test connection to data source using Kerberos as the authentication :
# # Access from Power BI mobile apps
# # # Configure the application registration
4 . Add the following Redirect URIs based on which platform you are using .
&gt; The Redirect URIs must be added for the application to work correctly .
# # # Connect from the Power BI mobile apps

1 . You save those datasets with featured tables to one of the new workspaces . Report creators can create reports with those featured tables .
# # Turn on the featured table preview
- Excel caches the list of data types so you need to restart Excel to see newly published featured tables .
Here are limitations for the initial preview .
You can also use those values to create rules , for example , to set values above zero a certain color , and values below to another color .
Lastly , you can create a border around an individual visualization , and like other controls , you can specify the color of that border as well .

# Row-level security with Power BI Embedded
# # Adding roles with Power BI Desktop
Here are a few things to notice with this schema :
Here &apos;s how :
# # Applying user and role to an embed token
The API accepts a list of identities with indication of the relevant datasets . For RLS to work , you need to pass the below pieces as part of the identity .
Use the following code below as an example :
# # Working with Analysis Services live connections
Row-level security can be used with Analysis Services live connections for on-premises servers . There are a few specific concepts that you should understand when using this type of connection .
The effective identity that is provided for the username property must be a Windows user with permissions on the Analysis Services server .
# # # Use of roles
Roles can be provided with the identity in an embed token . If no role is provided , the username that was provided can be used to resolve the associated roles .
# # # Using the CustomData feature
&gt; The CustomData username can only be 256 characters long .
You can use it inside the role DAX query , and you can use it without any role in a measure DAX query .
# # # # CustomData SDK Additions
The CustomData string property was added to our effective identity in the token generation scenario .
The identity can be created with custom data using the following call :
# # # # CustomData SDK Usage
If you &apos;re calling the REST API , you can add custom data inside each identity , for example :
2 . Create a Role in the Analysis Services server .
6 . Build a PBI report and publish it to a workspace with dedicated capacity .
&gt; When you &apos;re ready to deploy your application to production , the master user account field or option should not be visible to the end user .
8 . Now you can view the report in your application before applying the Custom data value ( s ) to see all the data your report holds .
Then apply the Custom data value ( s ) to see how the report displays a different set of data .
# # Token-based Identity with Azure SQL Database
# # # Token-based Identity SDK additions
The identity blob property was added to our effective identity in the token generation scenario .
The IdentityBlob type is a simple JSON structure holding a value string property
The EffectiveIdentity can be created with identity blob using the following call :
Identity blob can be created using the following call .
# # # Token-based Identity REST API Usage
# # On-premises data gateway with service principal
You can &apos;t set this permission using the admin portal . This permission is only set with the API . In the admin portal , you see an indication for users and SPNs with such permissions .
* Assignment of users to roles within the Power BI service doesn &apos;t affect RLS when using an embed token .
* While the Power BI service doesn &apos;t apply RLS setting to admins or members with edit permissions , when you supply an identity with an embed token , it applies to the data .
* Analysis Services live connections are supported for on-premises servers .
* A list of identities enables multiple identity tokens for dashboard embedding . For all others artifacts , the list contains a single identity .
* You can use RLS only if you have a dedicated capacity .
* RLS doesn &apos;t work with SQL Server on-premises .

You cannot hurt your data . Power BI is a great place for you to explore and experiment without worrying that you &apos;ll &quot; break &quot; anything .
That doesn &apos;t mean you can &apos;t save your changes - you can . But those changes only affect your view of the content . And reverting to the original default view is as easy as clicking a button .
The `supportsMultiVisualSelection` feature enables you to use selection in multiple visuals in a report .
This feature requires API v3.2.0 or higher .
To use the `supportsMultiVisualSelection` feature , add the following code to the `capabilities.json` file of your visual .
# Delete almost anything in Power BI service

title : View your data offline in the Power BI mobile apps
# View your data offline in the Power BI mobile apps
One advantage of viewing Power BI in a mobile app rather than in a mobile browser is that you can see your data even when you &apos;re not connected to a network .
By default , Power BI refreshes the data frequently so you get up-to-date answers to your business questions any time , even while commuting or roaming .
# # Data access while you &apos;re offline
While you &apos;re offline , you can access and interact with dashboards you &apos;ve accessed previously from the mobile app .
&gt; Reports based on DirectQuery are not cached and are not available offline .
You can turn off background refresh , for example , to avoid network usage . Check the settings on your device .
When you &apos;re offline with Power BI on your mobile device , you may encounter these limitations :
* Some tile types require an active server connection , so they aren &apos;t available offline ; for example , Bing map tiles and some custom tiles .
* Whole Excel workbooks in Power BI aren &apos;t available offline .

# Power BI Embedded performance best practices
This article provides recommendations for faster rendering of reports , dashboards , and tiles in your application .
# # Update tools and SDK packages
Keep tools and SDK packages up-to-date .
# # # Filters , bookmarks , and slicers
Organizations with Power BI Premium capacity or Power BI Embedded capacity can take advantage of query caching to speed up reports associated with a dataset .
&gt; Use the bootstrap API when it &apos;s possible to generate the iframe before it &apos;s visible to the end user .
To measure embedded performance , you may use two events :
Cached data is rendered when available but no additional event is generated .
To examine the performance of the report elements , you might use the Performance Analyzer in Power BI Desktop .
The Performance Analyzer will allow you to see and record logs that measure how each of your report elements performs .
&gt; Always remember to compare the embedded report performance to the performance on powerbi.com. This might help you understand the origin of your performance issues
# Frequently asked questions about Power BI Embedded
Developers and software companies , also known as independent software vendors ( ISVs ) , coding applications .
Power BI is a software-as-a-service analytics solution that gives organizations a single view of their most critical business data .
# # # How many embed tokens can I create ?
# # # Where can I learn more about capacity and SKUs in Power BI embedded analytics ?
* Sign in to your organizational directory ( Microsoft accounts aren &apos;t supported ) .
* You need to have an Azure subscription in your organizational directory .
# # # Can my capacity scale automatically to adjust to my app consumption ?
While there &apos;s no automatic scaling now , all the APIs are available to scale at any time .
When a user is granted permissions to a workspace , app , or artifact , it might not be immediately available through API calls .
The result can either be a missing artifact in a &apos; GET &apos; API response , or an error when trying to use the artifact .
# # # How can I find my PBI tenant region ?
You can use the PBI portal to find your PBI Tenant region .
* You can create PBIE for your tenant with subscription type CSP
* Partner account can sign in to customer tenant and purchase PBIE for customer tenant , specify customer tenant user as Power BI capacity admin
# # # Why do I get an unsupported account message ?
# # # Can I use APIs to create and manage Azure capacities ?
Available regions ( 16 - same regions as Power BI )
* Europe ( 2 ) - North Europe , West Europe
* Asia Pacific ( 2 ) - Southeast Asia , East Asia
* Brazil ( 1 ) - Brazil South
* Australia ( 1 ) - Australia Southeast
* India ( 1 ) - West India
* United Kingdom ( 1 ) - UK South
An ISV can implement their own authentication and authorization for their applications .
You can use your existing directory if you already have an Azure AD tenant . You can also create a new Azure AD tenant for your embedded application content security .
# # # What object ID is the service principal object ID ?
* Scale up / down
* Add capacity admins
* Pause / resume service
Use PowerBI.com to assign / un-assign workspaces to your Power BI Embedded capacity .
# # # What content pack data types can you embed ?
There &apos;s often confusion around when to use RLS versus JavaScript filters , because one method is about controlling what a specific user can see , and the other is about optimizing the user &apos;s view .
# # # Can you manage an On-premises data gateway with service principal ?
With a master account , you can install a data gateway , add users to the gateway , connect to data sources , and do other administrative tasks .
# # # Can you sign into the Power BI service with service principal ?
No - you can &apos;t sign into Power BI using service principal .
Also , you can &apos;t consume content as a user in external applications ( SaaS embed ) , only when you generate an embed token .
# # # What are the best practices to improve performance ?
Customers may change their usage on an hourly basis . There &apos;s no monthly or annual commitment for the Power BI Embedded service .
# # # Can I get started for free ?
There &apos;s no special Azure pricing for non-profit and educational entities .
Some of the features are :
* Capacity billing model .
# # Embedding setup tool
# # # What is the Embedding setup tool ?
# # # Which solution should I choose ?
# # # I &apos;ve downloaded the sample app , which solution do I choose ?
# # # How can I edit my registered application ?
# # # How can I edit my Power BI user profile or data ?
# Power BI data source prerequisites
&gt; Excel files that have an .xlsx extension do not require a separate provider installation .
# Automatic page refresh in Power BI
When using automatic page refresh , there are two refresh types available : fixed interval and change detection .
# # Authoring reports with automatic page refresh in Power BI Desktop
1 . Turns page refresh on or off .
3 . Inputs and information ( depending on refresh type )
When clicking on show details Power BI will provide further information on :
- If the feature is enabled by your admin ( only when logged into your Power BI account )
- The minimum interval allowed by your admin ( only when logged into your Power BI account )
- Actual rate of refresh ( usually longer than your selected interval )
- Last refresh time
Then , back on the page refresh section , you will see the information of which measure is being used for change detection and the defined interval for your reference .
&gt; Only one change detection measure is allowed per model .
# # Determining the refresh interval
As a best practice , the refresh interval should at least match your expected new data arrival rate :
* If new data arrives every second , set the interval to one second .
For low refresh intervals like one second , take factors like the following into consideration :
- The type of the DirectQuery data source
- The load your queries create on it
- The distance of your report viewers from the capacity &apos;s datacenter
This image shows the results of a DirectQuery source in Performance Analyzer :
Let &apos;s consider some other characteristics of this data source :
- Data arrives at a rate of 2 seconds
- Performance Analyzer shows a maximum query + display time of approximately 4.9 seconds ( 4,688 milliseconds )
- The data source is configured to handle approximately 1,000 concurrent queries per second
- You expect approximately 10 users to be viewing the report concurrently
So that results in the following equation :
Also note that this result might differ as you publish your report to the service . This difference occurs because the report will use the Azure Analysis Services instance that &apos;s hosted in the cloud . You might want to adjust your refresh rates accordingly .
For the same scenario we discussed before :
# # Automatic page refresh in the Power BI service
# # # Page refresh intervals
The page refresh types and intervals allowed in the Power BI service are affected by the report &apos;s workspace type . This applies to these scenarios :
* Publishing a report into a workspace that has automatic page refresh enabled
* Editing a page refresh interval that &apos;s already in a workspace
* Creating a report directly in the service
# # # Restrictions on refresh intervals
In the Power BI service , restrictions on automatic page refresh apply based on the workspace where the report is published , whether you &apos;re using Premium services , and the Premium capacity admin settings .
To clarify how these restrictions work , let &apos;s start with some background on capacities and workspaces .
Here are some details for the two workspace scenarios :
&#124; Storage mode &#124; Dedicated capacity &#124; Shared capacity &#124;
* Composite models that have at least one DirectQuery data source are supported .
* You can only have one change detection measure per dataset .
* There can only be a maximum of 10 models with change detection measure in a Power BI tenant .
Automatic page refresh is useful for monitoring scenarios and exploring fast-changing data . But sometimes it can put undue load on the capacity or data source .
To prevent undue load on data sources , Power BI has these safeguards :
There are two areas where you could still encounter performance bottlenecks :
Low-priority queries consist of automatic page refresh queries and model refresh queries . There &apos;s currently no way to distinguish between the load from automatic page refresh and model refresh queries .
If you notice that your capacity is overloaded with low-priority queries , there are a few actions you can take :
- Request a larger premium SKU .
- Ask the report owner to lower the refresh interval .
- In the capacity admin portal , you can :
- Turn off automatic page refresh for that capacity .
- Raise the minimum refresh interval , which will affect all reports on that capacity .
* It takes up to 5 minutes for automatic page refresh setting changes made in the capacity admin UI to propagate to reports .
* In addition to turning on automatic page refresh for the capacity , you also need to turn it on for the pages of a report where you want to enable it .
* Both refresh types are managed separately so make sure that the type of refresh you are enabling is turned on .
- See the first question in this section .
* Try refreshing the page to see if the problem resolves itself .
* Check with your capacity admin . The admin might have turned off the feature or raised the minimum refresh interval . ( See the second question in this section . )
* If your queries are taking longer to run , your refresh interval will be delayed . Automatic page refresh waits for all queries to finish before running new ones .
* Your capacity admin might have set a minimum refresh interval that &apos;s higher than the one you set in your report . Ask your capacity admin to lower the minimum refresh interval .
* * Are automatic page refresh queries served from the cache ? * *
* No . All automatic page refresh queries bypass any cached data .
* * My change detection measure is not triggering any updates * *
* Check whether you uploaded to a workspace with an attached Premium capacity . If you haven &apos;t , change detection will not work .
title : Add a filter to a report in Power BI
# # Filters in Editing view or Reading view
# # Levels of filters in the Filters pane
You can add a visual-level filter to a specific visual in two different ways .
* Filter a field that is already being used by the visualization .
# # # Filter the fields in the visual
4 . At this point , we &apos;ll add a filter to a field already being used by the visualization .
Now let &apos;s add a new field to our visualization as a visual-level filter .
And the visualization itself is now filtered to show only those managers &apos; sales this year for the specified stores .
# # Add a filter to an entire page
You can also add a page-level filter to filter an entire page .
All the visualizations on the page are redrawn to reflect the change .
If you save your report with the filter , report readers can interact with the filter in Reading view , selecting or clearing values .
2 . Add visualizations that track key metrics for the team executives &apos; business areas .
# # # Use the drillthrough filter

Whether you &apos;re creating a new column or measure , it &apos;s important to know the general format of table names in DAX :
The following image shows a DAX formula being created in Power BI :
It &apos;s best practice to * always * do the following :
* No spaces in table names
* Always include the table name in formulas ( don &apos;t omit it , even though DAX lets you )
The required elements for a calculated column are the following :
* a new column name
* at least one function or expression
The required elements for a measure are the same as they are for a calculated column :
* a new measure name
title : High-contrast mode support in Power BI visuals
# High-contrast mode support in Power BI visuals
# # # Detect that Power BI is in high-contrast mode
If `host.colorPalette.isHighContrast` is `true` , high-contrast mode is active and the visual should draw itself accordingly .
In high-contrast mode , your visual should limit itself to the following settings :
During initialization , you can store the following values :
Or you can store the `host` object during initialization and access the relevant `colorPalette` properties during update .
The specific implementations of high-contrast support vary from visual to visual and depend on the details of the graphic design . To keep important details easy to distinguish with the limited colors , high-contrast mode ordinarily requires a design that &apos;s slightly different from the default mode .
Power BI native visuals follow these guidelines :
* All data points use the same color ( foreground ) .
* Thick shapes are drawn as outlines , with thick strokes ( at least two pixels ) and background color fill .
* When data points are relevant , they &apos;re distinguished by different marker shapes , and data lines are distinguished by different dashing .
* When a data element is highlighted , all other elements change their opacity to 40 % .
* For slicers , active filter elements use foreground-selected color .
In the following sample bar chart , for example , all bars are drawn with two pixels of thick foreground outline and background fill . Compare the way it looks with default colors and with a couple of high-contrast themes :
The next section shows one place in the `visualTransform` function that was changed to support high contrast . It &apos;s called as part of rendering during the update .
title : Best practices for Power BI dataflows
&gt; The recommendations made in this article are guidelines . For each best practice in this article , there may be legitimate reasons to deviate from this guidance .
# # # Split ingestion and transformation to use the enhanced compute engine
Splitting dataflows is also beneficial for diagnosing and debugging refresh issues , especially when working with sources that have throttling limits .
# # # Perform actions that can use the enhanced compute engine
Ensure you make use of the enhanced compute engine by ensuring you perform joins and filter transformations first in a computed entity before performing other types of transformations .
# # # Split dataflows when connecting to SharePoint
# # # Avoid scheduling refresh for linked entities inside the same workspace
* Avoid setting a refresh schedule for a linked dataflow in the same workspace as the source dataflow
* If you want to configure a refresh schedule separately , and want to avoid the locking behavior , separate the dataflow in a separate workspace .
# # # Ensure capacity is in the same region
Dataflows do not currently support multi-geo regions . The Premium capacity must be in the same region as your Power BI tenant .
# # # Separate on-premises sources from cloud sources
This article provided information about best practices for dataflows . For more information about dataflows , the following articles may be helpful :

# # # Receive email notification service outages or incidents
You can be notified by email if your tenant is impacted by a service outage or incident . This way , you can proactively respond to incidents .
Information protection allows enforcing protection settings — such as encryption or watermarks — when exporting data from the Power BI service .
There are two tenant settings related to information protection . By default , both settings are disabled for the entire organization .
You can restrict users from creating workspaces . This way , you can govern what is created within your organization .
&gt; Currently there &apos;s a transition period between the old workspace experience and the new . This tenant setting applies only to the new experience .
We recommend you assign one or more security groups . These groups can be granted _ or denied _ permission to create workspaces .
Be sure to include instructions in your documentation letting users ( who don &apos;t have workspace creation rights ) know how they can request a new workspace .
Users can share reports and dashboards with people outside your organization .
We recommend you assign one or more security groups . These groups can be granted _ or denied _ permission to share content with external users .
You can restrict users from exporting data from dashboard tiles or report visuals .
We recommend you assign one or more security groups . These groups can be granted _ or denied _ permission to publish reports .
- Embed content in apps ( enabled by default )
- Allow service principals to user Power BI APIs ( disabled by default )
All visuals start with a class that implements the `IVisual` interface . You can name the class anything as long as there &apos;s exactly one class that implements the `IVisual` interface .
&gt; The visual class name must match what &apos;s defined in the * pbiviz.json * file .
See the sample visual class with the following methods that should be implemented :
* `constructor` , a standard constructor to initialize the visual &apos;s state
* `update` , to update the visual &apos;s data
* `enumerateObjectInstances` , to return objects to populate the property pane ( formatting options ) where you can modify them as needed
* `destroy` , a standard destructor for cleanup
The constructor of the visual class is called when the visual is instantiated . It can be used for any set up operations needed by the visual .
`IVisualHost` contains the following services :
* `persistProperties` , allows users to persist properties and save them along with the visual definition , so they &apos;re available on the next reload
* `authenticationService` , generates a service to help with user authentication
* `instanceId` , returns a string to identify the current visual instance
* `colorPalette` , returns the colorPalette required to apply colors to your data
* `fetchMoreData` , supports using more data than the standard limit ( 1K rows )
* `switchFocusModeState` , helps to change the focus mode state
All visuals must implement a public update method that &apos;s called whenever there &apos;s a change in the data or host environment .
* `viewport : IViewport` , dimensions of the viewport that the visual should be rendered within
* `objectName : string` , name of the object
The destroy function is called when your visual is unloaded and can be used for clean up tasks such as removing event listeners .
# Highlight data points in Power BI Visuals
&gt; Table data view mapping doesn &apos;t support the highlights feature .
# # Highlight data points with categorical data view mapping
The default visual source code after removing unnecessary code will look like this :
Import required interfaces to process data from Power BI :
Create root `div` element for category values :
Clear content of div elements before rendering new data :
Get categories and measure values from `dataView` object :
&gt; Values of `measureHighlights` property can be less that values of `categoryValues` property .
&gt; In means that value was higlighted partially .
Enumerate `categoryValues` array and get corresponding values and highlights :
Create `div` and `p` elements to display and visualize data view values in visual DOM :
Apply required styles for elements to use `flex box` and define colors for div elements :
In the result , you should have the following view of the visual .
# # Highlight data points with matrix data view mapping
The sample data to create hierarchy for matrix data view mapping :
Create the default visual project and apply sample of `capabilities.json` .
Create two `div` elements for visual layout :
Check the data in `update` method , to ensure that visual gets data :
Clear content of `div` elements before render new data :
Create `treeWalker` function to traverse matrix data structure :
Call the function for root elements of column and row of matrix data view structure :
Generate selectionID for nodes and Create buttons to display nodes :
The main step of using highlighting is to process additional array of values .
If you inspect the object of terminal node , you can see that the values array has two properties - value and highlight :
Where `value` property represents value of node without applying a selection from other visual , and highlight property indicates which part of data was highlighted .
&gt; Value of `highlight` property can be less that value of `value` property .
Add the code to process the `values` array of node if it is presented :
As the result you &apos;ll get the visual with buttons and values `highlighted value / default value`

title : Relationship troubleshooting guidance
This article targets you as a data modeler working with Power BI Desktop . It provides you with guidance on how to troubleshoot specific issues you may encounter when developing models and reports .
In this case , here &apos;s a general troubleshooting checklist to follow . You can progressively work through the checklist until you identify the issue ( s ) .
1 . If there &apos;s an empty query result , switch to Data view — verify that tables have been loaded with rows of data
1 . Switch to Model view — it &apos;s easy to see the relationships and quickly determine their properties
1 . Verify that relationships exist between the tables
1 . Verify that the relationships are active ( solid line )
1 . Verify that the filter directions support propagation ( interpret arrow heads )
1 . Switch to Data view , and verify that matching values can be found in related columns
Here &apos;s a list of issues together with possible solutions .
&#124; Issue &#124; Possible reason ( s ) &#124;
title : Find and access your content with Google Search
# Find and access your content with Google Search
&#124; Android phones &#124; Android tablets &#124;
You can use Google Search to find and open the Power BI mobile app right to the report or dashboard you are looking for . You don &apos;t have to navigate through the app .
If you want to open a specific item and you &apos;re not sure where to look for it , you can use Google Search to find the item .
* If only one match is found , the Power BI mobile app will open the item you were looking for .
Your content appears in the left-hand side nav pane .
title : &quot; Subreports in Power BI paginated reports &quot;
# Subreports in Power BI paginated reports
In this illustration , the contact information displayed in the main Sales Order report actually comes from a Contacts subreport .
# # Work with Report Builder and the Power BI service
# # Save a local report to the Power BI service
# # Add a subreport to a report
The * * Subreport Properties * * dialog box opens .
# # Use parameters in subreports
To pass parameters from the parent report to the subreport , define a report parameter in the report that you use as the subreport . When you place the subreport in the parent report , you can select the report parameter and a value to pass from the parent report to the report parameter in the subreport .
# # Preview paginated reports in Report Builder
You can preview your reports in Report Builder .
Because Report Builder is a design tool , previewing the report may look different from rendering the report in the Power BI service .
# # # Notes about previewing
# # # Maintaining the connection
If you rename a subreport in the workspace , you need to fix the name reference in the main report . Otherwise , the subreport won &apos;t render . The main report still renders with an error message inside the subreport item .

title : Reduce the size of an Excel workbook to view it in Power BI
# Reduce the size of an Excel workbook to view it in Power BI
* The workbook as a whole can be up to 1 GB .
* The core worksheet contents can be up to 30 MB .
# # What makes core worksheet contents larger than 30 MB
Here are some elements that can make the core worksheet contents larger than 30 MB :
Consider removing these elements , if possible .
If the report has a Data Model , you have some other options :
To make any of these changes , you need to edit the workbook in Excel .
# # Remove data from worksheets
When you import data into Excel , follow these tips :
The data is imported only into the Data Model , with no data in Excel worksheets .
In the workspace where you saved the sample , find the Customer Profitability dashboard and select it :
# # # Company-wide dashboard tiles
2 . Review the tiles on the left side of the dashboard .
- The company &apos;s gross margin is 42.5 % .
- It has 80 customers .
- It sells five different products .
- It had its lowest revenue % variance to budget in February , followed by the highest in March .
- Total revenue for the year is close to budget .
# # # Manager-specific dashboard tiles
By analyzing the manager-specific dashboard tiles , we can make the following observations :
- Annelie &apos;s GM % is the lowest , but we see a steady increase since March .
- Valery , on the other hand , has seen their GM % drop significantly .
- Andrew had a volatile year .
# # Explore the dashboard &apos;s underlying data
This dashboard has tiles that link to a report and to an Excel workbook .
# # # Open the Excel Online data source
3 . Let &apos;s look into why Carlos hasn &apos;t hit his target yet :
5 . Use your browser &apos;s back arrow to return to the dashboard .
# # # Open the underlying Power BI report
Many of the tiles on the Customer Profitability sample dashboard were pinned from the underlying Customer Profitability sample report .
1 . Select one of these tiles to open the report in Reading view .
2 . The report has three pages . Each tab at the bottom of the report represents a different page .
# # # Team Scorecard page
Let &apos;s look at two of the team members in detail and see what insights can be gained :
* Valery &apos;s revenue variance also paints a worrying picture ; Valery is not meeting set revenue margins .
# # # Industry Margin Analysis
3 . As you select each manager in the chart , note the following details :
* Annelie &apos;s chart is similar , except that Annelie only concentrates on a handful of industry segments with a focus on the Federal segment and a focus on the Gladius product .
This page has a custom page size format .
# # Dig into the data by asking questions with Q &amp; A
For our analysis , it might be helpful to determine which industry generates the most revenue for Valery . Let &apos;s use Q &amp; A .
As you can see , the Distribution industry is the biggest revenue area for Valery .
# # # Dig deeper by adding filters
Let &apos;s take a look at the Distribution industry .
We can similarly explore other industries and even add customers to our visuals to understand causes for Valery &apos;s performance .

title : Power BI visual data point selections
# Add interactivity into visual by Power BI visuals selections
`Selection` object corresponds to the interface :
# # How to use SelectionManager to select data points
# # # Create an instance of the selection manager
For using the selection manager , you need to create the instance of a selection manager . Usually , visuals create a selection manager instance in the `constructor` of the visual object .
# # # Create an instance of the selection builder
This object has corresponded methods to create `selections` for different types of data view mappings .
&gt; If you need to use selections for table or matrix data view mappings you need to update API version to 2.5.0 or higher .
# # # Create selections for categorical data view mapping
Let &apos;s review how selections represent on categorical data view mapping for sample dataset :
And the visual uses the following data view mapping :
And visual should able to slice data by `Manufacturer` and `Type` too .
Need to fill the visual data baskets .
# # # # Create selections for categories
# # # # Create selections for series
# # # Create selections for table data view mapping
Sample of table data views mapping
To create a selection for each row of table data view mapping , you need to call `withTable` method of selection builder .
The visual code iterates the rows of the table and each row calls `withTable` table method . Parameters of `withTable` method are `table` object and index of the table row .
# # # Create selections for matrix data view mapping
In the sample , `nodeWalker` calls recursively for each node and child nodes .
# # Select datapoints to slice other visuals
The interface of `select` method is
The typical scenario of using `multiSelect` handling CTRL button state on click event .

Here are a few tips for dashboards .
# # Dashboard design best practices video
What are the key metrics that will help them make decisions ? How will the dashboard be used ? What learned or cultural assumptions may affect design choices ? What information does your audience need to be successful ?
# # Tell a story on one screen
Is the dashboard too cluttered ? Remove all but essential information that &apos;s easily read and interpreted .
# # Make use of full screen mode
# # Accent the most important information
But be sure to provide context .
# # Place the most important information
# # Use the right visualization for the data
* Be careful using visuals that look pretty but are hard to read , such as 3-D charts .
* Be consistent with chart scales on axes , chart dimension ordering , and also the colors used for dimension values within charts .
* Don ’ t mix levels of precision and time . Make sure that time frames are well understood . Don ’ t have one chart that has last month next to filtered charts from a specific month of the year .
* Don ’ t clutter your charts with data labels that aren &apos;t needed . The values in bar charts are usually understood without displaying the actual number .

# Developer handbook overview , Power BI Report Server
Welcome to the developer handbook for Power BI Report Server , an on-premises location for storing and managing your Power BI , mobile , and paginated reports .
This handbook highlights options you have , as a developer , to work with Power BI Report Server .
# # # Report Viewer Control
You have several API options for interacting with Power BI Report Server . This technique includes the following .
There are several types of extensions you can build .
* Data processing extensions
* Delivery extensions
* Rendering extensions for paginated reports
* Security extensions
title : Deployment pipelines best practices
# Deployment pipelines best practices ( preview )
This article provides guidance for BI creators who are managing their content throughout its lifecycle . It focuses on leveraging deployment pipelines as a BI content lifecycle management tool .
The article is divided into four sections :
Prepare your content for on-going management throughout its lifecycle . Make sure you review the information in this section , before you do any of the following :
* Release your content to production
* Start using a deployment pipeline for a specific workspace
* Publish your work
# # # Treat each workspace as a complete package of analytics
* * * Modeling and data workspaces * * - These workspaces will contain all the centralized datasets
# # # Plan your permission model
To implement a secure and easy workflow , plan who gets access to each part of the pipeline . Some of the considerations to take into account are :
* Who should have access to the pipeline ?
* Which operations should users with pipeline access be able to perform in each stage ?
* Who &apos;s reviewing content in the test stage ?
* Should the test stage reviewers have access to the pipeline ?
* Who will oversee deployment to the production stage ?
* Which workspace are you assigning ?
* Which stage are you assigning your workspace to ?
* Do you need to make changes to the permissions of the workspace you &apos;re assigning ?
# # # Connect different stages to different databases
# # # Use parameters in your model
In deployment pipelines , you can configure parameter rules to set specific values for the development , test , and production stages .
Parameters have additional uses , such as making changes to queries , filters , and the text displayed in the report .
This section provides guidance for working with the deployment pipelines development stage .
* It is easier to collaborate with fellow creators on the same .pbix file , if all changes are being done on the same tool .
* Making online changes , downloading the .pbix file , and then uploading it again , creates reports and datasets duplication .
* You can use version control to keep your .pbix files up to date .
# # # Version control for .pbix files
# # # Separate modeling development from report and dashboard development
For enterprise scale deployments , it &apos;s recommended to separate dataset development , and the development of reports and dashboards . To promote changes to only a report or a dataset , use the deployment pipelines selective deploy option .
# # # Manage your models using XMLA read / write capabilities
This section provides guidance for working with the deployment pipelines test stage .
# # # Simulate your production environment
Make sure that these three factors are addressed in your test environment :
* A similar capacity as in production
# # # Use dataset rules with a real-life data source
You can also use this approach if you don &apos;t want to overload your capacity .
&gt; It &apos;s recommended to monitor capacity loads again , after deploying updates to the production stage .
# # # Check related items
Related times can be affected by changes to datasets or reports . During testing , verify that your changes don &apos;t impact or break the performance of existing items , which can be dependent on the updated ones .
# # # Test your app
This section provides guidance to the deployment pipelines production stage .
# # # Manage who can deploy to production
In addition , you should limit access to the pipeline by only enabling pipeline permissions to users that are part of the content creation process .
# # # Set rules to ensure production stage availability
Make sure that you set production dataset rules for data sources and parameters defined in the dataset .
# # # Update the production app
# # # Quick fixes to content
# Get webpage data by providing examples
Prices in graphics are for example purposes only .
# # Using Get Data from Web by example
&gt; Value suggestions only include values less than or equal to 128 characters in length .
From there , you can create visuals or otherwise use the Web page data when creating your Power BI Desktop reports .

title : Interacting with an ArcGIS map that has been shared with you
# Interact with ArcGIS maps in Power BI
An ArcGIS Maps for Power BI visual can have several different types of layers of demographic location information .
or a canvas with street and transportation detail .
# # Interact with an ArcGIS Maps for Power BI visual
# # # # The single-select tool
Here we &apos;ve selected a brown bubble data point from our base map . Power BI :
- highlights our selection ,
- displays a tooltip for that data point ,
- updates the infographics cards to display data for just our selection , and
- cross-hghlights the column chart .
# # # # The multi-select tool
# # # # The reference layer tool
# # # # The buffer tool
# # # # The Find Similar tool
* * The ArcGIS map is not showing up * *
* * I &apos;m not seeing all of my information on the map * *
* * I &apos;m getting an error message about my cache being full * *
# Design filters in Power BI reports
As a report designer , here are some of the tasks you can do in the new Filters pane :
- Add and remove fields to filter on .
- Change the filter state .
- Format and customize the Filters pane so that it feels part of your report .
- Define whether the Filters pane is open or collapsed by default when a consumer opens the report .
- Hide the entire Filters pane or specific filters that you don &apos;t want report consumers to see .
- Control and even bookmark the visibility , open , and collapsed state of the Filters pane .
- Lock filters that you don &apos;t want consumers to edit .
When reading a report , users can hover over any visual to see a read-only list of all the filters or slicers affecting that visual .
# # Turn on new filters in existing reports
# # # Turn on new filters for an existing report in the service
If you haven &apos;t turned on the new look , you can still see the new filter experience by following these steps .
1 . In the Power BI service , open the content list for a workspace .
# # View filters for a visual in Reading mode
Here are the types of filters this view shows :
# # Build the Filters pane
2 . To start building your Filters pane , drag fields of interest into the Filters pane either as visual , page , or report level filters .
# # Hide the Filters pane while editing
# # Lock or hide filters
As you turn these settings on and off in the Filters pane , you see the changes reflected in the report . Hidden filters don &apos;t show up in the pop-up filter list for a visual .
You can also configure the Filters pane state to flow with your report bookmarks . The pane &apos;s open , close , and visibility state are all bookmarkable .
# # Format the Filters pane
A big part of the filter experience is that you can format the Filters pane to match the look and feel of your report . You can also format the Filters pane differently for each page in the report . Here are elements you can format :
- Border on or off
- Title and header font , color , and text size
- Border : on or off
- Font , color , and text size
- Input box color
# # # Format the Filters pane and cards
You see options for formatting the report page , the wallpaper , and also the Filters pane and Filter cards .
# # Theming for Filters pane
You can now modify the default settings of the Filters pane with the theme file . Here &apos;s a sample theme snippet to get you started :
# # Sort the Filters pane
Custom sort functionality is available in the Filters pane . When creating your report , you can drag and drop filters to rearrange them in any order .
# # Improved Filters pane accessibility
The Filters pane search feature allows you to search across your filter cards by title . This feature is helpful if you have several different filter cards in your Filters pane and need help finding the ones of interest .
You can also format the search box , just as you can format the other elements of the Filters pane .
# # Restrict changes to filter type
# # Apply filters button ( preview )
# # # Turn on Apply
You can set this feature at the report level . However , the feature is off by default .
# # # Format the Apply button
Publish-to-web doesn &apos;t display the Filters pane . If you &apos;re planning to publish a report to the web , consider adding slicers for filtering .
3 . Then Power BI Desktop gets a visual back from the R installation , and displays it on the canvas
It &apos;s a great way to use the power of R , right in Power BI Desktop .
Whether you create reports or just view and interact with them , you now know how all those cool visuals are created , and how they connected to the data . Next we get to see those visuals and reports in action .
title : Build permission for shared datasets
# Build permission for shared datasets
- To export the underlying data .
- To access the data via the XMLA endpoint .
# # Ways to give Build permission
You give Build permission for a dataset in a few different ways :
- Members of a workspace with at least a Contributor role automatically have Build permission for datasets in that workspace , and permission to copy a report .
That opens the Permission center for that dataset , where you can set and change permissions .
# # Remove Build permission for a dataset
At some point , you may need to remove Build permission for some users of a shared dataset .
They can still see the report built on the shared dataset , but they can no longer edit it .
With this more granular Build permission , you can choose who can only view the content in the existing report or dashboard and who can create content connected to the underlying datasets .
If your dataset is being used by a report outside the dataset workspace , you can &apos;t delete that dataset . Instead , you see an error message .
# Create a paginated report based on a Power BI shared dataset
Here &apos;s a list of what you need and don &apos;t need to use a shared dataset in Power BI Report Builder .
# # Connect to the Power BI dataset
Report Builder fills in the dataset name .
1 . The dataset is listed under Data Sources in the Report Data pane .
Remember , you can connect to multiple Power BI datasets and other data sources in the same paginated report .
# # Get the DAX query for the dataset
# # # Video : Get the DAX query
# # # Steps to get the DAX query
Now here are the steps to get the query .
# # Create the dataset with the query
&gt; If your query includes the TOPN function , delete it from your query .
You see the results of the query in the lower box .
Now you see your new dataset with a list of its fields in the Report Data pane .
# # Create a table in the report
One quick way to create a table is to use the Table Wizard .
You see your table in Design View .
This report layout needs some work . It has 54 pages because the columns and margins make the table two pages wide .
You have several formatting options to make your table fit on one page .
1 . Select the report , not the table or title .
1 . You can also make columns narrower . Select the column border and drag the right side to the left .
1 . Another option is to make sure the number values are formatted well . Select a cell with a number value .
&gt; You can format more than cell at a time by holding down the Shift key while you select the other cells .
# # # Getting rid of blank pages
Even if you &apos;ve made the margins and the table columns narrower , you may still end up with every other page being blank . Why ? Because of the math .
1 . Select the right edge of the report design surface , and drag it so it &apos;s less than the desired number on the ruler .
- Datasets with Promoted or Certified endorsements appear in the list of available datasets , but they aren &apos;t marked as such .
title : Search and find your content using global search
Not all columns can be sorted . Hover over the column headings to discover which can be sorted .
# # Using a Power BI service live connection for report lifecycle management
# # Step by step for using the Power BI service live connection
If Anna isn &apos;t signed in to the Power BI service account , Power BI prompts Anna to do so .
The publishing process begins , and Power BI Desktop shows the progress .
Next , let &apos;s see how other teammates who have access to the workspace where the report and dataset were published can connect to the dataset and build their own reports .
When using the Power BI service live connection , there are a few limitations and considerations to keep in mind .
* Only users with Build permission for a dataset can connect to a published dataset using the Power BI service live connection .
* Members of a workspace can &apos;t replace the originally shared report . Attempts to do so result in a warning that prompts you to rename the file , and publish .
* If you delete the shared dataset in the Power BI service , then other reports based on that dataset will no longer work properly or display their visuals .
title : &apos; Procurement Analysis sample : Take a tour&apos;
* Who the top vendors are
* What categories we spend the most on
* Which vendors give us the highest discount and when
First , let &apos;s look for trends in spending by category and location .
Let &apos;s explore the spending areas in Mexico .
3 . Select the up arrow on the upper-left corner of the chart to drill back up .
4 . Select the drill-down arrow again to turn drill down off .
We can use highlighting to evaluate different cities .
Let &apos;s also explore the discounts available from vendors , and the time periods when we get the most discounts :
* Are the discounts different each month or do they remain the same ?
* Do some cities get more discounts than others ?
# # # Discount by month
# # # Discount by city
Another area to explore is the discount by city . Select each city in turn in the tree map and see how the other charts change :
* St. Louis had a large spike in total invoices in February and a large dip in discount savings in April .
# # # Edit the report
Select * * Edit report * * in the upper-left corner and explore in Editing view :
* See how the pages are made .
* Add pages and charts based on the same data .
* Change the visualization type for a chart ; for example , change the tree map to a donut chart .
* Pin charts to your dashboard .
title : Print from the Power BI service
# Printing from the Power BI service
# # What can be printed
# # Adjust your browser print settings
Here are a few quick tips you can use to format your printout .
2 . To fit more onto a printed page , adjust things like margins and scale .
Experiment with your particular browser &apos;s settings until you get the look that you like . Some browsers even have options to print background graphics .
1 . Open the dashboard that you &apos;d like to print .
# # Print a dashboard tile
4 . Hover over the tile to reveal the Options menu .
&gt; If you &apos;ve followed all of these steps and your tile still isn &apos;t displaying the way you want it to , try the following .
# # Print a report page
Reports can be printed one page at a time .
2 . The Print window for your browser opens .
# # Print a report visual
* Q : I cannot print all the report pages at once .
* A : That is correct . Report pages can only be printed one page at a time .
* Q : I cannot print to PDF .
* A : You will only see this option if you &apos;ve already configured the PDF driver in your browser .
* A : The Print screens vary by browser and software version .
* A : Go back to the dashboard or report in default view and re-open the visual in Focus mode and then Full screen mode .
The template app dashboard includes tiles and metrics that cover a variety of areas , with corresponding reports to learn more :
&#124; Inventory &#124; Monthly sales amount by product &#124; Inventory &#124;
The dataset also includes the following tables to customize your reports and dashboards :
* Bank Statement Daily Balance
* Bank Statements
* Expense Claims
* Invoice Line Items
* Month End
* Trial Balance
# Publish an app in Power BI
Business users get your apps in a few different ways :
- They can find and install your app from Microsoft AppSource .
- You can send them a direct link .
- You can install it automatically in your coworkers &apos; Power BI accounts if your Power BI administrator gives you permission .
&gt; If your app relies on datasets from other workspaces , it is your responsibility to ensure all app users have access to the underlying datasets .
# # Change your published app
After you publish your app , you may want to change or update it . It &apos;s easy to update it if you &apos;re an admin or member in the new workspace .
1 . Open the workspace that corresponds to the app .
2 . Make any changes you want to the dashboards or reports .
The people you &apos;ve published the app to automatically see the updated version of the app .
# # Design the navigation experience
You can further customize the app navigation by :
* Reordering the items using the up / down arrows .
* Hiding certain items from the navigation .
# # # Considerations for using the new navigation builder option
Here are general things to keep in mind when using the new navigation builder :
&gt; Your report might have only one visible page because you &apos;ve set up navigation to the rest of the pages with buttons or drillthrough actions .
* The option to not use the app builder is available .
When adding links to your app navigation and selecting the Content area option :
* Ensure the link can be embedded . Some services block the embedding of their content in third-party sites like Power BI .
* Embedding Power BI service content like reports or dashboards in other workspaces isn &apos;t supported .
# # Automatically install apps for end users
# # # How to push an app automatically to end users
# # # How users get the apps that you push to them
# # # Considerations for automatically installing apps
Here are things to keep in mind when pushing apps to end users :
* If users don &apos;t immediately see the app in the Apps list , they should refresh or close and reopen their browser .
* Guest users who haven &apos;t accepted an invite don &apos;t get apps automatically installed for them .
# # Allow users to connect to datasets
- Create reports and dashboards based on these datasets .
# # Allow users to copy reports
Any member of a workspace can unpublish the app .
This action uninstalls the app for everyone you &apos;ve published it to , and they no longer have access to it . It doesn &apos;t delete the workspace or its contents .
# # View your published app
In full-screen mode , you can show or hide the navigation by selecting the option in the corner .
Things to keep in mind about publishing apps :
* For the new workspace experience , if the user added to the app access list already has access to the app through the workspace , they will not be shown in the access list for the app .
The easiest method to display your entire dashboard in one screen is selecting the * * Full Screen Mode * * button in the top right-hand corner of the dashboard .
Another way to manage dashboard space is collapsing the nav pane on the left-hand side of the page , by selecting the hamburger icon . To expand the nav pane , click the icon again .
You can ensure that a dashboard will always have a collapsed nav pane by appending the following to the end of the URL :
Users who follow that link will open the dashboard with a collapsed nav pane .
title : &quot; DAX : Column and measure references &quot;
# DAX : Column and measure references

# # How to enable the updated ribbon
# # Features of the updated ribbon
The benefits of updating our ribbon are intended to make the experience across Power BI Desktop , as well as other Microsoft products , easy and familiar .
These benefits can be grouped into the following categories :
* Create more flexible and intuitive controls in the ribbon , such as the visuals gallery
* Improve accessibility
title : Add multiple fields to a hierarchy slicer
# Add multiple fields to a hierarchy slicer
When you select one or more children for an item , you see a semi-selected circle for the top-level item .
The behavior of the slicer hasn &apos;t changed . You can also style your slicer how you want . For example , you can set it to single-select mode . Or you can swap between a list and dropdown .
You can also make the following formatting changes .
# # # Change the title
You can edit the title for any slicer , but it &apos;s especially useful for hierarchy slicers . By default , the name of a hierarchy slicer is a list of the field names in the hierarchy .
Select the text and add a new name .
# # # Change the expand / collapse icon
Hierarchy slicers have some other formatting options . You can change the expand / collapse icon from the default arrow to a plus / minus signs , or a caret .
# # # Change the indentation
# # Prepare for the migration
You need to determine which tenant setup to use .
* Use your existing corporate Power BI tenant ?
* Use a separate tenant for your application ?
* Use a separate tenant for each customer ?
# # Accounts within Azure AD
The following accounts will need to exist within your tenant .
&gt; These accounts will need to have Power BI Pro licenses in order to use workspaces .
1 . A tenant admin user .
It is recommended that this user be a member of all workspaces created for the purpose of embedding .
2 . Accounts for analysts that will create content .
These users should be assigned to workspaces as needed .
&gt; This is just a regular user account in your organization that will be used for the purposes of embedding .
# # App registration and permissions
You will need to register an application within Azure AD and grant certain permissions .
# # # Register an application
# # Create workspaces ( Required )
&gt; You cannot use a personal workspace to take advantage of embedding to non-Power BI users .
&gt; The application * master * account needs to be an admin of the workspace .
Migrating your content from your workspace collections to Power BI Embedded can be done in parallel to your current solution and doesn &apos;t require any downtime .
Content migration relies mainly on two APIs .
There are several types of reports , each requiring a somewhat different migration flow .
# # # # Cached dataset &amp; report
Cached datasets refer to PBIX files that had imported data as opposed to a live connection or DirectQuery connection .
3 . Call Import PBIX to SaaS workspace .
# # # # DirectQuery dataset &amp; report
4 . Call Import PBIX to SaaS workspace .
# # # # Old dataset &amp; reports
2 . Call Import PBIX to SaaS workspace .
# # # # Push Dataset &amp; report
2 . Rebuild report for the created dataset * .
It is possible , using some workarounds , to migrate the push api report from PaaS to SaaS by trying the following .
1 . Uploading some dummy PBIX to PaaS workspace .
2 . Clone the push api report and bind it to the dummy PBIX from step 1 .
3 . Download push API report with the dummy PBIX .
4 . Upload dummy PBIX to your SaaS workspace .
5 . Create push dataset in your SaaS workspace .
6 . Rebind report to push api dataset .
# # Create and upload new reports
3 . Embed your reports from powerbi.com into your application .
# # Map your users to a Power BI user
# # What to do when you are ready for production
When you are ready to move to production , you will need to do the following .
* Edit the workspace and assign it to a Premium capacity under advanced .
* Deploy your updated application to production and begin embedding reports from the Power BI Embedded .
You should do some cleanup within Azure .
* Delete any Workspace Collections that exist within Azure .
# Apply many-many relationships in Power BI Desktop
# # What a relationship with a many-many cardinality solves
# # Use relationships with a many-many cardinality
For example , take a look at the simple model in this image :
Sometimes the tables are joined by two columns , yet neither column is unique . For example , consider these two tables :
* Create a third table that contains only the unique State IDs . The table could be any or all of :
* A table based on a query that &apos;s defined in Query Editor , which could display the unique IDs drawn from one of the tables .
* The combined full set .
* Then relate the two original tables to that new table by using common * Many-1 * relationships .
# # Use a relationship with a many-many cardinality instead of the workaround
The major differences between * relationships with a many-many cardinality * and the more typical * Many-1 * relationships are as follows :
There are a few limitations for this release of * relationships with a many-many cardinality * and composite models .
# Composite model guidance in Power BI Desktop
# # Composite model use cases
Further , you can consider developing a Composite model in the following situations .
- You want to combine two or more DirectQuery data sources into a single model .
# # # Table storage mode
In a Composite model , you can configure the storage mode for each table ( except calculated tables ) :
There are several possible scenarios when Power BI queries a Composite model :
In summary , we recommend that you :
- Consider carefully that a Composite model is the right solution — while it allows model-level integration of different data sources , it also introduces design complexities with possible consequences
- Strive to ensure data integrity across data sources ( including the model cache ) — weak relationships will eliminate rows when related column values don &apos;t match
- Optimize DirectQuery data sources with appropriate indexes for efficient joins , filtering and grouping
# Data sources for the Power BI service
* An online service like Google Analytics or QuickBooks
* A database in the cloud like Azure SQL Database
* A database or file on a local computer or server in your own organization

title : &quot; Power BI Developer in a Day course &quot;
The course was designed specifically for experienced app developers . So , it &apos;s an advantage if you have development experience with :
Familiarity with Power BI will be beneficial , but not essential . We &apos;ll introduce you to the core concepts .
&gt; - Acquire access using Azure AD apps and tokens
&gt; - Work with the Power BI REST API
&gt; - Embed Power BI content in your apps
&gt; - Choose the right license to suit your requirements
Follow these steps to get set up :
# # Share and collaborate with colleagues in Power BI
* Get introduced to the tools that make sharing and collaborating easier with Power BI *
# # # Storage modes and dataset types
# # # # Datasets in Import mode
&#124; Capacity type &#124; Maximum dataset size &#124;
# # # # Push datasets
# # # Power BI refresh types
To review past synchronization cycles , check the OneDrive tab in the refresh history . The following screenshot shows a completed synchronization cycle for a sample dataset .
# # # # Refresh of query caches
# # # # Refresh of report visuals
- A dataset uses data sources that reside on-premises
- A dataset uses data sources in the cloud
- A dataset uses data from both , on-premises and cloud sources
# # # Connecting to on-premises data sources
You have the following options :
- Choose an enterprise data gateway with the required data source definition
- Deploy a personal data gateway
# # # # Using an enterprise data gateway
# # # Accessing cloud data sources
&gt; Each user can only have one set of credentials per data source , across all of the data sets they own , regardless of the workspaces where the datasets reside .
# # # Accessing on-premises and cloud sources in the same source query
Power BI datasets rely on Power Query to access and retrieve source data . The following mashup listing shows a basic example of a query that merges data from an on-premises source and a cloud source .
There are two options to configure a data gateway to support merging or appending data from on-premises and cloud sources :
- Add a data source definition for the cloud source to the data gateway in addition to the on-premises data sources .
# # # Configuring query parameters
# # Refresh and dynamic data sources
# # # Setting a refresh schedule
# # # Getting refresh failure notifications
# # # Checking refresh status and history
In addition , consider the following recommendations to establish and maintain reliable data refresh processes for your datasets :
- Ensure that Power BI can send refresh failure notifications to your mailbox . Spam filters might block the email messages or move them into a separate folder where you might not notice them immediately .

# Visual interactions in Power BI visuals
&gt; You should enable tooltips in all scenarios , regardless of which flag is indicated .
The `allowInteractions` flag is passed as a Boolean during the initialization of the visual , as a member of the IVisualHost interface .
This industry sample dashboard and underlying report focus on one of the typical supply chain challenges : supplier quality analysis . Two primary metrics are at play in this analysis : total number of defects and the total downtime that these defects caused .
This sample has two main objectives :
* Understand who the best and worst suppliers are , with respect to quality .
* Identify which plants do a better job finding and rejecting defects , to minimize downtime .
# # Downtime caused by defective materials
Let &apos;s analyze the downtime caused by defective materials and see which vendors are responsible .
The Supplier Quality Analysis Sample report opens to the * * Downtime Analysis * * page .
# # # Which are the worst suppliers ?
Now let &apos;s explore which plant does a better job managing defective material , resulting in less downtime .
The report opens to the * * Supplier Quality Analysis * * page .
# # Which material type is best managed ?
The best managed material type is the one with lowest downtime or no impact , regardless of defect quantity .
Let &apos;s verify that this material type doesn &apos;t cause much downtime , despite high defect quantity .
Raw materials appear to be well managed ; although they have more defects , they have lower total downtime minutes .
# # # Compare defects to downtime by year
3 . Do more defects translate into more downtime ? Ask questions in the Q &amp; A box to find out .
There were many more raw materials defects in 2014 than in 2013 .
# # # Compare defects to downtime month to month
Let &apos;s look at another dashboard tile related to total defective quantity .
Let &apos;s see if this increase in defect quantity led to an equal increase in downtime minutes .
2 . In the question box , type * total downtime minutes by month and year as a line chart * .
Other than a jump in downtime minutes during June and October , the number of defects didn &apos;t result in significantly more downtime . This result shows we &apos;re managing defects well .
Here are a few videos from that playlist to get you started .

title : Use the Power BI Q &amp; A visual
# Introduction to Power BI Q &amp; A visualizations
# # What are Q &amp; A visualizations ?
The Q &amp; A visual allows users to ask natural language questions and get answers in the form of a visual .
The Q &amp; A visual consists of four core components ;
- The question box . This is where users type in their question and are shown suggestions to help them complete their question .
- A pre-populated list of suggested questions .
- Icon to convert the Q &amp; A visual into a standard visual .
- Icon to open Q &amp; A tooling which allows designers to configure the underlying natural language engine .
# # Create a Q &amp; A visual using a suggested question
In this exercise , we &apos;ll select one of the suggested questions to create our Q &amp; A visual .
1 . Start on a blank report page and select the Q &amp; A visual icon from the Visualizations pane .
2 . Drag the border to resize the visual .
# # Create a Q &amp; A visual using a natural language query
6 . Let &apos;s change the visual to a column chart .
# # Format and customize the Q &amp; A visual
The Q &amp; A visual can be customized using the formatting pane , and by applying a theme .
# # # Apply a theme
When you select a theme , that theme is applied to the entire report page . There are many themes to choose from , so try them out until you get the look you desire .
# # # Format the Q &amp; A visual
# # Convert your Q &amp; A visual into a standard visual
We &apos;ve formatted our color blind safe column chart visual a bit -- added a title and a border . Now we &apos;re ready to convert it to a standard visual in our report and also pin it to a dashboard .
# # Advanced features of the Q &amp; A visual
Selecting the cog icon opens the Q &amp; A visual Tooling pane .
The Q &amp; A visual integrates with Office and Bing to attempt to match unrecognized common words with fields in your dataset .
There are a variety of ways you can integrate natural language . For more information , see the following articles :
You can also split each column by category , by dragging a category into the Column Series field in the Visualizations pane . When you do so , each bar is proportionately colored based on the values within each category .
Combination charts are an effective way to visualize multiple measures that have very different scales in a single visualization .

title : Customize X-axis and Y-axis properties
Watch Amanda customize her X- and Y-axes . She &apos;ll also demonstrate the different ways to control concatenation when using drill down and drill up .
# # Add a new visualization
Before you can customize your visualization , you have to build it .
2 . At the bottom , select the yellow plus icon to add a new page .
Now you can customize your X-axis . Power BI gives you almost limitless options for formatting your visualization .
# # # Customize the X-axis labels
The X-axis labels display below the columns in the chart . Right now , they &apos;re light grey , small , and difficult to read . Let &apos;s change that .
2 . Expand the X-axis options .
4 . Format the text color , size , and font :
5 . Maybe you don &apos;t like the way the X-axis text is displayed on a diagonal . You have several options .
- Change the text size to something smaller than 14 .
- Make the visualization larger .
Here , we &apos;ve selected the second option and grabbed one of the resize bars to make the visualization wider . It now accommodates the 14-point text without needing to display the text on an angle or with a scrollbar .
# # # Customize the X-axis title
1 . Format the title text color , size , and font :
After you finish the customizations , your stacked column chart looks something like this :
The following example continues our customization of a column chart . Let &apos;s make a few changes to get you familiar with the options , and then you can explore the rest on your own .
# # # Customize the Y-axis labels
The Y-axis labels are displayed to the left by default . Right now , they &apos;re light grey , small , and difficult to read . Let &apos;s change that .
1 . Expand the Y-Axis options .
One reason you might want to turn off the Y-axis , is to save space for more data .
# # # Customize the Y-axis title
# # # Customize the gridlines
Let &apos;s make the gridlines stand out by changing the color and increasing the stroke :
After all these customizations , your column chart should look something like this :
# # Customizing visualizations with dual Y axes
# # # Create a chart with two Y-Axes
3 . Reformat the visualization to remove the angled X-axis labels .
# # # Format the second Y-Axis
Because we started with a visualization with one formatted Y-axis , Power BI created the second Y-axis using the same settings . But we can change that .
# # # Add titles to both axes
With a visualization that &apos;s complex , it helps to add axes titles . Titles help your colleagues understand the story your visualization is telling .
1 . Your combo chart now shows dual axes , both with titles .
1 . Format the titles . In this example , we &apos;ve shorted one of the titles and reduced the font size for both .

title : On-premises data gateway sizing
The on-premises data gateway supports two workloads . It &apos;s important you first understand these workloads before we discuss gateway sizing and recommendations .
# # # Live Connection and DirectQuery workloads
Reliable , fast , and consistent connectivity is important to ensure report users have responsive experiences .
Determining the correct sizing for your gateway machine can depend on the following variables :
- The number of concurrent dataset refreshes
- The volume of data to be retrieved from data sources
- Any transformations required to be done by the Power Query mashup engine
- The volume of data to be transferred to the Power BI service
- For Live Connection and DirectQuery workloads :
- The number of concurrent report users
- The number of visuals on report pages ( each visual sends at least one query )
- The frequency of Power BI dashboard query cache updates
Gateway sizing recommendations depend on many variables . In this section , we provide you with general recommendations that you can take into consideration .
Plan for the best possible connectivity between the Power BI service and your gateway , and your gateway and the data sources .
- Strive for reliability , fast speeds , and low , consistent latencies
- Eliminate — or reduce — machine hops between the gateway and your data sources
- Install one or more gateways in a cluster
- Isolate workloads to standalone gateways , or clusters of gateway servers
# # # Dataset design and settings
Dataset design , and their settings , can impact on gateway workloads . To reduce gateway workload , you can consider the following actions .
- Configure less frequent data refresh
- Especially when dynamic RLS is enforced , restrict dashboard cache update frequency
For Live Connection datasets :
title : Learn how to connect to dataflows in Power BI
# Connect to data sources for Power BI dataflows
With Power BI dataflows , you can connect to many different data sources to create new dataflows , or add new entities to an existing dataflow .
This article lists the many available data sources for creating or adding to dataflows , and describes how to create those dataflows using these data sources .
# # Create a dataflow from a data source
# # Data sources for dataflows

# # Create and deploy template apps
# # Configuring the gateway and data source
The following steps describe how to establish a trust relationship between a HANA server and the gateway IdP by signing the gateway IdP &apos;s X509 certificate with a Root CA trusted by the HANA server . You &apos;ll create this Root CA :
Ensure that the Root CA &apos;s private key is secured properly . If it &apos;s obtained by a third party , it could be used to gain unauthorized access to the HANA server .
1 . Create the gateway IdP &apos;s X509 certificate .
1 . Sign the certificate-signing request by using the Root CA you &apos;ve configured your HANA servers to trust .
The resulting IdP certificate is valid for a year ( see the -days option ) .
Import your IdP &apos;s certificate in HANA Studio to create a new SAML Identity Provider :
Now that you have the gateway &apos;s certificate and identity configured , convert the certificate to a pfx format and configure the gateway to use the certificate :
1 . Copy the pfx file to the gateway machine :
1 . Grant the gateway service account access to the private key of the certificate :
Finally , follow these steps to add the certificate thumbprint to the gateway configuration :
1 . Run the following PowerShell command to list the certificates on your machine :
1 . Copy the thumbprint for the certificate you created .
1 . On the SAP HANA server , turn on the authentication trace by running the following query :
You should find a detailed error message that indicates the root cause , for example :
1 . After the troubleshooting is complete , turn off the authentication trace by running the following query :

title : View a Power BI dashboard
You may find dashboards in all of the containers in the nav pane .
title : Use what-if parameters to visualize variables
# Create and use what-if parameters to visualize variables in Power BI Desktop
# # Creating a what-if parameter
In addition to creating the parameter , creating a what-if parameter also creates a measure , which you can use to visualize the current value of the what-if parameter .
# # Using a what-if parameter
Let &apos;s create a simple example of using a what-if parameter . We created the what-if parameter in the previous section . Now we &apos;ll put it to use by creating a new measure whose value adjusts with the slider .
And , that &apos;s all there is to it . You can use what-if parameters in all sorts of situations . These parameters enable the consumers of reports to interact with different scenarios that you create in your reports .
As long as your model has a date field , Power BI will automatically generate different views for different time hierarchies .
As mentioned before , this course builds your knowledge by following the common flow of work in Power BI :
# Incremental refresh in Power BI
Incremental refresh enables very large datasets in Power BI with the following benefits :
To define the parameters with default values , in the Power Query Editor , select * * Manage Parameters * * .
# # # # Filter date column updates
# # # # Query folding
# # # Define the refresh policy
Incremental refresh is available on the context menu for tables , except for Live Connection models .
# # # # Incremental refresh dialog
The incremental refresh dialog is displayed . Use the toggle to enable the dialog .
&gt; If the Power Query expression for the table doesn &apos;t refer to the parameters with reserved names , the toggle is disabled .
The header text explains the following :
# # # # Refresh ranges
- Add a new day of data .
- Refresh ten days up to the current date .
The first refresh in the Power BI service may take longer to import all five full calendar years . Subsequent refreshes may be finished in a fraction of the time .
# # # # Current date
# # # Advanced policy options
# # # # Detect data changes
&gt; The current design requires that the column to detect data changes is persisted and cached into memory . You may want to consider one of the following techniques to reduce cardinality and memory consumption .
&gt; Persist only the maximum value of this column at time of refresh , perhaps using a Power Query function .
&gt; Reduce the precision to a level that is acceptable given your refresh-frequency requirements .
&gt; Define a custom query for detecting data changes using the XMLA endpoint and avoid persisting the column value altogether . See custom queries for detect data changes below for more information .
# # # # Only refresh complete periods
# # Publish to the service
You can now refresh the model . The first refresh may take longer to import the historical data . Subsequent refreshes can be much quicker because they use incremental refresh .
# # XMLA endpoint benefits for incremental refresh
# # # # Override incremental refresh behavior
The following parameters can be inserted into the TMSL refresh command to override the default incremental refresh behavior .
# # # Custom queries for detect data changes

title : Copy and paste a visualization in the Power BI service
# Copy a visual as an image to your clipboard
Have you ever wanted to share an image from a Power BI report or dashboard ? Now you can copy the visual and paste it into any other application that supports pasting .
When you copy a static image of a visual , you get a copy of the visual along with the metadata . This includes :
* link back to the Power BI report or dashboard
* title of the report or dashboard
* notice if the image contains confidential information
* last updated time stamp
* filters applied to the visual
# # # Copy from a dashboard tile
1 . Navigate to the dashboard you want to copy from .
# # # Copy from a report visual
1 . Navigate to the report you want to copy from .
5 . If there is a data sensitivity label applied to the report , you &apos;ll receive a warning when you select the copy icon .
And , a sensitivity label will be added to the metadata below the pasted visual .
Q : Why is the Copy icon disabled on a visual ?
A : We currently support native Power BI visuals and certified custom visuals . There is limited support for certain visuals including :
- ESRI and other Map visuals
A : The ability to copy a visual can be turned off by your IT department or Power BI administrator .
Q : Why is my visual not pasting correctly ?
A : There are limitations for custom visuals and animated visuals .
title : Large datasets , data point limits , and data strategies
# Apply data-point limits and strategies by visual type
# # Data reduction strategies
Each visual controls the parameters on those strategies to influence the overall amount of data .
* * * Binned line sampling * * - Sample data points based on outliers in bins across an axis
* * * Overlapping points sampling * * - Sample data points based on overlapping values to preserve outliers
Dynamic limits are automatically applied when the server is capable as detailed below :

# Use conditional formatting in tables
&gt; Conditional formatting overrides any custom background or font color you apply to the conditionally formatted cell .
The following sections describe each conditional formatting option . You can combine more than one option in a single table column .
# # Format background or font color
# # Color by color scale
An example table with color scale background formatting on the * * Affordability * * column looks like this :
The example table with color scale font formatting on the * * Affordability * * column looks like this :
An example table with rules-based background color formatting on the * * Affordability * * column looks like this :
# # Color by color values
If you have a field or measure with color name or hex value data , you can use conditional formatting to automatically apply those colors to a column &apos;s background or font color . You can also use custom logic to apply colors to the font or background .
The following table has a color name associated with each state :
# # Color based on a calculation
You can create a calculation that outputs different values based on business logic conditions you select . Creating a formula is usually faster than creating multiple rules in the conditional formatting dialog .
You can create many more variations , just by using your imagination and some calculations .
The following example adds icons based on three rules :
# # Format as web URLs
Beginning with the April 2020 release , you can apply conditional formatting rules to totals and subtotals , for both table and matrix visuals .
There are a few considerations to keep in mind when working with conditional table formatting :
- Any table that doesn &apos;t have a grouping is displayed as a single row that doesn &apos;t support conditional formatting .

title : Dynamic row-level security with Analysis services tabular model
# Implement row-level security in an Analysis Services tabular model
* Build the tabular model with necessary fact and dimension tables
* Define user roles and permissions
* Deploy the model to an * Analysis Services tabular * instance
* Build a Power BI Desktop report that displays data tailored to the user accessing the report
* Deploy the report to * Power BI service *
* Create a new dashboard based on the report
* Share the dashboard with your coworkers
# # Task 1 : Create the user security table and define data relationship
The steps here require using the AdventureworksDW2012 relational database .
1 . Once you create and save the table , you need to establish the relationship between the `DimUserSecurity` table &apos;s `SalesTerritoryID` column and the `DimSalesTerritory` table &apos;s `SalesTerritoryKey` column , as shown below .
You &apos;ll see these users in upcoming tasks .
# # Task 2 : Create the tabular model with facts and dimension tables
1 . Import all the necessary tables into the model as shown below .
This formula specifies that all columns resolve to `false` ; meaning `DimUserSecurity` table columns can &apos;t be queried .
# # Task 3 : Add Data Sources within your On-premises data gateway
Once your tabular model is deployed and ready for consumption , you need to add a data source connection to your on-premises Analysis Services tabular server .
With this procedure complete , the gateway is configured and ready to interact with your on-premises Analysis Services data source .
With Power BI , dynamic security works only with a live connection .
# # Task 6 : Understand what happens behind the scenes
You can also see below the DAX query that is getting executed to populate report data .
* On-premises row-level security with Power BI is only available with live connection .
* Any changes in the data after processing the model would be immediately available for the users accessing the report with live connection from the Power BI service .
title : &quot; Getting around in Report Design View for paginated reports &quot;
# Getting around in Report Design View for paginated reports
# # 1 Report Data pane
After you add items to the Report Data pane , drag fields to report items on the design surface to control where data appears in the report .
&gt; If you drag a field from the Report Data pane directly to the report design surface instead of placing it in a data region such as a table or chart , when you run the report , you will see only the first value from the data in that field .
Some things are automatically added to the Report Data pane when you add something to the report design surface . For example , if you embed an image in your report , it will be added to the Images folder in the Report Data pane .
# # 2 Report design surface
You can also change the following :
# # # Design surface size and print area
With report parameters , you can control report data , connect related reports together , and vary report presentation . The Parameters pane provides a flexible layout for the report parameters .

# Tutorial : Embed Power BI content into an application for your customers
&gt; * Embed a Power BI report into an application .
# # Set up your embedded analytics development environment
However , if you choose to set up the environment manually , you can continue below .
Depending on which method you take , affects which type of application you register in Azure .
# # # Create a workspace
# # # Create and publish your reports
The below steps walk through how to publish your PBIX report to your Power BI workspace .
This sample is deliberately kept simple for demonstration purposes . It &apos;s up to you or your developers to protect the application secret or the master account credentials .
# # # Power BI username and password
These attributes are needed only for the master account AuthenticationType .
# # Embed content within your application
Below is a code example for using the reports GenerateTokenInGroup embed token API .
Below is an example of using this API .
You can use JavaScript to load a report into a div element on your web page .
Now that you &apos;ve completed developing your application , it &apos;s time to back your workspace with a dedicated capacity .
By creating a dedicated capacity , you can take advantage of having a dedicated resource for your customer . There are two types of capacity you can choose from :
&gt; With A SKUs , you can &apos;t access Power BI content with a FREE Power BI license .
For development testing , you can use embed trial tokens with a Pro license . To embed in a production environment , use a dedicated capacity .

title : Configure and manage capacities in Power BI Premium
# Configure and manage capacities in Power BI Premium
You manage a capacity by selecting the name of the capacity . This takes you to the capacity management screen .
If you have available v-cores , set up your new capacity by following these steps .
1 . Give your capacity a name .
1 . Define who the admin is for this capacity .
1 . Select your capacity size . Available options are dependent on how many available v-cores you have . You can &apos;t select an option that is larger than what you have available .
Capacity admins , as well as Power BI admins and global administrators , then see the capacity listed in the admin portal .
1 . You can also rename or delete a capacity .
&gt; Power BI Embedded capacity settings are managed in the Microsoft Azure portal .
# # # Change capacity size
Administrators are free to create , resize and delete nodes , so long as they have the requisite number of v-cores .
P SKUs cannot be downgraded to EM SKUs . You can hover over any disabled options to see an explanation .
# # # Manage user permissions
# # Assign a workspace to a capacity
There are two ways to assign a workspace to a capacity : in the admin portal ; and from a workspace .

Dataflow refresh scheduling is managed directly from the workspace in which your dataflow was created , just like your datasets .
Here are some examples of how dataflows can work for you :
# # How to use dataflows
# # # Extend the common data model for your business needs
Public APIs allow developers simple and easy ways to interact with Power BI and dataflows .
# # # Extend your capabilities with Azure
# # Dataflow capabilities on Power BI Premium
* Creating your own custom entities to unify data across your organization
* Getting started with dataflows for developers
# Enable sensitivity labels in Power BI
When sensitivity labels are enabled :
* All members of the organization can see those labels .
1 . Enable the toggle .
* When sensitivity labels are enabled for the entire organization , exceptions are typically security groups .
* When sensitivity labels are enabled only for specific users or security groups , exceptions are typically specific users .
This approach makes it possible to prevent certain users from applying sensitivity labels in Power BI , even if they belong to a group that has permissions to do so .
You need to configure certificates for both the WAP application and the AD FS server . Both of these certificates must be part of a valid certificate authority that your machines recognize .
# # 1 . Configure the report server
# # # Service Principal Name ( SPN )
On the AD FS server , using AD FS Management App , complete these steps .
When completed , the properties of the Relying Party Trusts should look like the following .
# # # Configure constrained delegation

# # Roles in the new workspaces
# # # Administering new workspace experience workspaces
Power BI audits the following activities for new workspace experience workspaces .
&#124; Friendly name &#124; Operation name &#124;
Limitations to be aware of :
- Workspaces can contain a maximum of 1,000 datasets , or 1,000 reports per dataset .
* * Are existing workspaces upgraded to the new workspace experience with GA ? * *
No . The new workspace experience GA only changes the default workspace type to the new workspace experience . Existing classic workspaces that are based on Microsoft 365 groups remain unchanged .
Yes . Since we support both types of workspaces side by side , we continue to list all Microsoft 365 groups you have access to in the workspaces list .
# # Transform , shape , and merge your cloud data
You can create different reports for different audiences too , using the same data connections and even the same Query . Just build a new report page , refine your visualizations for each audience , and watch it keep the business in the know .
For more information , take a look at the following resources :
# # Context insights with Power BI Embedded analytics

# Use DirectQuery in Power BI Desktop
There are a few benefits to using DirectQuery :
- DirectQuery lets you build visualizations over very large datasets , where it would otherwise be unfeasible to first import all the data with pre-aggregation .
- The 1-GB dataset limitation * doesn &apos;t * apply to DirectQuery .
There are currently a few limitations to using DirectQuery :
- Limitations are placed on DAX expressions allowed in measures to ensure that queries sent to the underlying data source have acceptable performance .
The following three points should be taken into consideration when using DirectQuery :
# # Publish to the Power BI service
Reports created using DirectQuery can be published to the Power BI service .
# Waterfall charts in Power BI

To create a measure , follow these steps :
The formula bar appears along the top of the report canvas , where you can rename your measure and enter a DAX formula .
An opening parenthesis appears , along with a drop-down suggestion list of the available columns you can pass to the SUM function .
The column name preceded by the table name is called the fully qualified name of the column . Fully qualified column names make your formulas easier to read .
&gt; Syntax errors are most often caused by a missing or misplaced closing parenthesis .
1 . Subtract the other two columns inside the formula :
The down arrow turns into an up arrow and a large box appears .
# # # Use your measure in the report
# # # Use your measure with a slicer
Add a slicer to further filter net sales and sales amounts by calendar year :
This action creates a blank table visualization on the report canvas .
# # # Use your measure in another measure
The resulting formula should appear as :
The chart shows the net sales amount per unit over all products sold . This chart isn &apos;t very informative ; we &apos;ll address it in the next step .
Ok , now we &apos;re just playing , but you have to admit that &apos;s cool ! Experiment with other ways to filter and format the visualization .

# Using OAuth to connect to Power BI Report Server and SSRS
&gt; Viewing Power BI Reports hosted in Power BI Report Server using WAP to authenticate is now supported for iOS and Android apps .
The public URL will be that the Power BI mobile app will connect to . For example , it may look similar to the following .
You need to configure certificates for both the WAP application and the ADFS server . Both of these certificates must be part of a valid certificate authority that your mobile devices recognize .
There isn &apos;t much to configure on the Reporting Services side . We just need to make sure that we have a valid Service Principal Name ( SPN ) to enable the proper Kerberos authentication to occur and that the Reporting Services server is enabled for negotiate authentication .
The SPN is a unique identifier for a service that uses Kerberos authentication . You need to make sure you have a proper HTTP SPN present for your report server .
# # # Create an application group
You can create the application group with the following steps .
* * Android Apps only need the following steps : * *
&gt; This URL is case sensitive !
When completed , you should see the properties of your application group look similar to the following .
To configure constrained delegation , you want to do the following steps .

# Add colors to your Power BI visuals
This article describes how to add colors to your visuals and how to handle data points for a color visual .
`IVisualHost` exposes color as one of its services .
# # Add color to data points
A different color represents each data point .
Add the color to the `BarChartDataPoint` interface , as in the following example :
# # Use the color palette service
The `colorPalette` service manages the colors used in your visual .
An instance of the service is available on `IVisualHost` .
Define it in the `update` method .
# # Assigning color to data points
Next , specify `dataPoints` .
In this example , each of the `dataPoints` includes value , category , and color .
`dataPoints` can also include other properties .
In `SampleBarChart` , the `visualTransform` method encapsulates the `dataPoints` calculation .
That method is a part of the Bar Chart viewmodel .
Because the method iterates through the `dataPoints` calculation in `visualTransform` , it &apos;s the ideal place to assign colors , as in the following code :
title : One-to-one relationship guidance
There are two scenarios that involve one-to-one relationships :
- Reduce storage space
- Simplify model calculations
- Contribute to improved query performance
- Deliver a more intuitive * * Fields * * pane experience to your report authors
Consider a source sales table that stores sales order details in two columns .
# # Row data spans across tables
To help describe how the relationship filter propagation works , the model diagram has been modified to reveal the table rows . All examples in this article are based on this data .
When possible , we recommend you avoid creating one-to-one model relationships when row data spans across model tables . It &apos;s because this design can :
- Make it difficult for report authors to find related fields , because they &apos;re distributed across multiple tables
- Limit the ability to create hierarchies , as their levels must be based on columns from the _ same table _
- Produce unexpected results when there isn &apos;t a complete match of rows between the tables
The following steps present a methodology to consolidate and model the one-to-one related data :
Let &apos;s see what happens when fields from both tables are added to a table visual , and a weak relationship exists between the tables .
title : Share a dataset
# # Steps to sharing your dataset
A best practice is to save the .pbix file to a Microsoft 365 group .
Already , other members of this workspace can create reports in other workspaces based on this dataset . Use the Manage Permissions option on the dataset in the workspace content list give additional users access to the dataset .
When you have a shared dataset in your workspace , you may need to know what reports in other workspaces are based on it .
Things to keep in mind about sharing datasets :
# Connect to data by using Power BI Desktop generic interfaces
# # Power BI Desktop data interfaces
In the following sections , you can find lists of data sources that can be accessed by these generic interfaces .
# # Data sources accessible through ODBC
# # Data sources accessible through OLE DB
# # Data sources accessible through OData
# # Data sources accessible through REST APIs
# # Data sources accessible through R Script
title : High-Density Line Sampling in Power BI
# # How the new line sampling algorithm works
The new algorithm for high-density line sampling is available for line chart and area chart visuals with a continuous x-axis .
# # # Minimum and maximum values for high-density line visuals
For any given visualization , the following visual limitations apply :
# # # Evaluating representative data points for high-density line visuals
If that sounds like a lot of analysis to ensure the occasional outlier is captured and properly displayed in the visual , you are correct , but that &apos;s the exact reason for the new algorithm and binning process .
This situation will happen frequently with tooltips . The high and low values for a given bin might not match perfectly with the evenly scaled x-axis value points , and as such the tooltip will not display the value .
# # How to turn on high-density line sampling
* When the size of an overall data source is too big , the new algorithm eliminates series ( legend elements ) to accommodate the data import maximum constraint .
For information about high-density sampling in scatter charts , see the following article .

# Power BI Premium Metrics app
* Active memory
The following sections describe the landing page , and the three metrics report pages , in detail .
# # Premium capacity health center
The three KPIs show the current health of the selected Premium capacity , based on the settings applied to each of the three KPIs .
Those two scenarios are described in the following sections .
# # # Scenario one - current load is too high
The alarm threshold , which is the red dotted line , marks incidents of 90 % memory consumption .
The warning threshold , which is the yellow dotted line , marks incidents of 70 % memory consumption .
The black dotted line indicates the memory usage trendline , based on the current capacity &apos;s memory usage over the course of the graph timeline .
# # # # Diagnosing scenario one
Consistent high active memory utilization may result in forcing datasets that are actively being used to be evicted , or can prevent new datasets from able to load . The following steps can help you diagnose problems
# # # # Remedies for scenario one
You can take the following steps to remedy the problems associated with scenario one :
# # # Scenario two - future load will exceed limits
# # # # Diagnosing scenario two
To diagnose scenario two , determine if the trend line is showing an upward trend towards warning or alarm thresholds .
# # # # Remedies for scenario two
You can take the following steps to remedy the problems associated with scenario two :
# # The query waits metric
The gauge in this visual shows that in the last seven days from the time the report was last refreshed , 17.32 % of the queries waited more than 100 milliseconds .
We discuss each query waits scenario , in turn , in the following sections .
# # # Scenario one - long running queries consume CPU
In scenario one , long running queries are taking up too much CPU .
On the report page , the following visuals appear :
There are steps you can take to diagnose and remedy issues with query wait times , described next .
First , you can determine if long running queries are occurring when your queries are waiting .
Here are steps you can take to remedy issues from scenario one :
# # # Scenario two - too many queries
In scenario two , too many queries are executing .
# # The refresh waits metric
This gauge shows that in the last seven days from the last refresh report refresh , 3.18 % of the refreshes waited more than 10 minutes .
There are two scenarios explained , which you can show on the report page by selecting Scenario 1 or Scenario 2 on the page . We discuss each scenario in turn , in the following sections .
# # # Scenario one - not enough memory
In scenario one , there isn &apos;t enough available memory to load the dataset . There are two situations that result in a refresh being throttled during low memory conditions :
1 . Not enough memory to load the dataset .
2 . The refresh was canceled due to a higher priority operation .
The priority for loading datasets is the following :
1 . Interactive query
2 . On-demand refresh
3 . Scheduled refresh
To diagnose scenario one , first determine whether throttling is due to insufficient memory . The steps to do so are the following .
# # # Scenario two - not enough CPU for refresh
In scenario two , there isn &apos;t enough available CPU to carry out the refresh .
To diagnose scenario two , first determine whether throttling is due to running into the maximum concurrency for refreshes . The steps to do so are the following .
The following bulleted list describes considerations — and possible limitations — related to the _ Auto date / time _ option .

title : Datasets in the Power BI service
# Datasets in the Power BI service
This article provides a technical explanation of Power BI datasets .
- Connecting to an existing data model that isn &apos;t hosted in a Power BI capacity
- Uploading a Power BI Desktop file that contains a model
# # # Excel workbook models
Distinctions , then , can be made about Power BI datasets that represent models :
- They &apos;re either hosted in the Power BI service , or are externally hosted by Analysis Services .
- They can store imported data , or they can issue pass-through query requests to underlying data sources , or they can use a mix of both .
Here is a summary of important facts about Power BI datasets that represent models :
- Power BI-hosted models that import data :
- Must be fully loaded into memory so that they can be queried .
- Require refresh to keep data current , and must involve gateways when source data isn &apos;t accessible directly over the internet .
- Models may enforce RLS rules , enforcing filters to limit data access to certain users .
It &apos;s also important to understand that Power BI-hosted Import models can refresh according to a schedule , or be triggered on-demand by a user in the Power BI service .

title : Introduction to use chart utils in Power BI visual
ChartUtils is a set of interfaces and methods for creating axis , data labels , and legends in Power BI Visuals .
The axis helper ( `axis` object in utils ) provides functions to simplify manipulations with axis .
This function returns recommended number of ticks according to width of chart .
This function returns recommended number of ticks according to height of chart .
Gets the optimal number of ticks based on minimum value , maximum value , and measure metadata and max tick count ;
This function returns the margins for tick labels .
Checks if value is of DateTime type .
Uses the D3 scale to get the actual category thickness .
This function finds and returns the closest x-axis index .
This function computes and returns a diff of values in the scale .
This function creates a domain of values for axis .
This function gets the `ValueType` of a category column . Default is `Text` if the type isn &apos;t present .
This function creates a D3 axis including scale . Can be vertical or horizontal , and either datetime , numeric , or text .
This function sets customized domain , but don &apos;t change when nothing is set .
This function combines the forced domain with the actual domain if one of the values was set .
The forcedDomain is in first priority . Extends the domain if any reference point requires it .
This function indicates whether the number is power of 10 .
The `DataLabelManager` helps to create and maintain labels . It arranges label elements using the anchor point or rectangle . Collisions can be automatically detected to reposition or hide elements .
The `DataLabelManager` class provides the following methods :
This method arranges the labels position and visibility on the canvas according to labels sizes and overlapping .
This static method checks if provided rectangle is valid ( has positive width and height ) .
The `DataLabelUtils` provides utils to manipulate data labels .
This function calculates precision from given format .
This function returns format precision from given format .
This function returns VisualObjectInstance for data labels .
This function adds VisualObjectInstance for Category data labels to enumeration object .
This function returns Cache Manager that provides quick access to formatted labels
The `Legend` service provides helper interfaces for creating and managing PBI legends for Power BI visuals
This helper function simplifies Power BI Custom Visual legends creation .
This Interface implements all methods necessary for legend creation

For more information about Power BI Premium or Multi-Geo , take a look at the following resources :
# Multi-Geo support for Power BI Embedded
# # Creating new Power BI Embedded Capacity resource with Multi-Geo
Notice that when opening the location drop-down menu , your home tenant is the default selection .
When choosing a different location , a message prompts you to make sure you &apos;re aware of the selection .
You can see your capacities location easily when going to the main Power BI Embedded management page in the Azure portal .
You can &apos;t change a Power BI Embedded resource location once you &apos;ve created a new capacity .
To move your Power BI content to a different region , follow these steps :
2 . Assign all workspaces from the existing capacity to the new capacity .
3 . Delete or pause the old capacity .
It &apos;s important to note that if you decide to delete a capacity without reassigning its content , all the content in that capacity moves to a shared capacity , which is in your home region .
# # API support for Multi-Geo
To support management of capacities with Multi-Geo through API , we have made some changes to existing APIs :
* Confirm that any movement you initiate between regions follows all corporate and government compliance requirements before initiating data transfer .
* In an embedding for your customers scenario , query text and query result continue to transit through the home tenant .

# Create and use filled maps ( choropleth maps ) in Power BI
# # What is sent to Bing
# # When to use a filled map
Filled maps are a great choice :
* to display quantitative information on a map .
* to show spatial patterns and relationships .
* when your data is standardized .
* when working with socioeconomic data .
* when defined regions are important .
* to get an overview of the distribution across the geographic locations .
# # # Create a filled map
3 . Filter the map to display only the continental United States .
Power BI gives you plenty of control over the appearance of your filled map . Play around with these data color controls until you get the look you want .
Highlighting a location in a filled map cross-filters the other visualizations on the report page ... and vice versa .
2 . Copy the filled map using CTRL-C .
title : Objects and properties of Power BI visuals
# Objects and properties of Power BI visuals
`myCustomObject` is the internal name that &apos;s used to reference the object within `dataView` and `enumerateObjectInstances` .
`displayName` is the name that will be shown in the property pane .
`properties` is a map of properties that are defined by the developer .
&gt; `show` is a special property that enables a switch to toggle the object .
There are two property types : `ValueTypeDescriptor` and `StructuralTypeDescriptor` .
# # # # Value type descriptor
`ValueTypeDescriptor` types are mostly primitive and are ordinarily used as a static object .
Here are some of the common `ValueTypeDescriptor` elements :
# # # # Structural type descriptor
`StructuralTypeDescriptor` types are mostly used for data-bound objects .
The most common `StructuralTypeDescriptor` type is * fill * .
An example is shown in the following code :
To use objects effectively , you need a function in your custom visual called `enumerateObjectInstances` . This function populates the property pane with objects and also determines where your objects should be bound within the dataView .
Here is what a typical setup looks like :
The properties in `enumerateObjectInstances` reflect the properties that you defined in your capabilities . For an example , go to the end of this article .
The selector in `enumerateObjectInstances` determines where each object is bound in the dataView . There are four distinct options .
This object is bound to columns with the matching `QueryName` .
# # # # Scope identity
# # # # # Example
title : Manage your data source - Import / scheduled refresh
# Manage your data source - Import / scheduled refresh
Then fill in the information for the data source , which includes the source information and credentials that are used to access the data source .
# # Use the data source for scheduled refresh
&gt; If your dataset contains multiple data sources , each data source must be added within the gateway . If one or more data sources aren &apos;t added to the gateway , you won &apos;t see the gateway as available for scheduled refresh .

# Tutorial : Create an R-powered Power BI visual
This tutorial describes how to create an R-powered visual for Power BI .
&gt; * Create an R-powered visual
&gt; * Add libraries to the visual
&gt; * Add a static property
This command creates a new folder structure based on the `rvisual` template . This template includes a basic , ready-to-run R-powered visual that runs the following R script :
The `Values` data frame will contain columns in `Values` data role .
# # Editing the R Script
# # Add libraries to visual package
This procedure allows your visual to use the `corrplot` package .
1 . Add the library dependency for your visual to `dependencies.json`. Here is an example of the file content :
1 . After you make these changes , start using the package in your `script.r` file .
The result of using `corrplot` package looks like this example :
# # Adding a static property to the property pane
Enable users to change UI settings . To do this , add properties to the property pane that change the user-input based behavior of the R script .
After these steps , you can change the property of the visual .
Finally , the R script must start with a property . If the user doesn &apos;t change the property , the visual doesn &apos;t get any value for this property .
1 . Change the R script in your visual to match the following code :
Your final visual looks like the following example :
# Formula editor in Power BI Desktop
# # Using the formula editor
You can use the following keyboard shortcuts to increase your productivity and to streamline creating formulas in the formula editor .
The following articles provide more information about formulas and DAX in Power BI Desktop .
The * combine files * transform behaves as follows :
* The transform allows you to select a specific object from the first file , such as an Excel workbook , to extract .
* The combine files transform then automatically takes these actions :
* Creates an example query that performs all the required extraction steps in a single file .
With the behavior of combine files , you can easily combine all files within a given folder if they have the same file type and structure ( such as the same columns ) .
In addition , you can easily apply additional transformation or extraction steps by modifying the automatically created exemplar query , without having to worry about modifying or creating additional function query steps . Any changes to the exemplar query are automatically generated in the linked function query .
# Data sources in Power BI Desktop
The * * All * * category includes all data connection types from all categories .
# # # File data sources
The * * File * * category provides the following data connections :

# # # Azure data sources
* HDInsight Interactive Query
# # # Online Services data sources
The * * Online Services * * category provides the following data connections :
# # # Other data sources
The * * Other * * category provides the following data connections :
# # Using PBIDS files to get data
From that point forward , the user can begin building visualizations or select * * Recent Sources * * to load a new set of tables into the model .
Currently , PBIDS files only support a single data source in one file . Specifying more than one data source results in an error .
# # # PBIDS file examples
The PBIDS file * doesn &apos;t * include authentication information and table and schema information .
These examples are for convenience only , aren &apos;t meant to be comprehensive , and don &apos;t include all supported connectors in DSR format . An administrator or organization can create their own data sources using these examples as guides , from which they can create and support their own data source files .
# # # # SharePoint list
The URL must point to the SharePoint site itself , not to a list within the site . Users get a navigator that allows them to select one or more lists from that site , each of which becomes a table in the model .

The on-premises data gateway supports an in-place upgrade , and _ settings takeover _ of existing gateways .
# # # Run the gateway Windows service as a domain account
# # Obtain domain admin rights to configure SPNs ( SetSPN ) and Kerberos constrained delegation settings
To configure SPNs and Kerberos delegation settings , a domain administrator should avoid granting rights to someone that doesn &apos;t have domain admin rights . In the following section , we cover the recommended configuration steps in more detail .
# # Configure Kerberos constrained delegation for the gateway and data source
If necessary , configure an SPN for the gateway service domain account as a domain administrator and configure delegation settings on the gateway service domain account .
# # # Configure an SPN for the gateway service account
First , determine whether an SPN was already created for the domain account used as the gateway service account :
To complete this configuration step , for each domain that contains Active Directory users you want the gateway service account to be able to impersonate :
8 . Restart the gateway service .
# # # Decide on the type of Kerberos constrained delegation to use
Depending on which approach you want to use , proceed to one of the following sections . Don &apos;t complete both sections :

title : &quot; DAX : Use variables to improve your formulas &quot;
# DAX : Use variables to improve your formulas
As a data modeler , writing and debugging some DAX calculations can be challenging . It &apos;s common that complex calculation requirements often involve writing compound or complex expressions . Compound expressions can involve the use of many nested functions , and possibly the reuse of expression logic .
Using variables in your DAX formulas helps you write complex and efficient calculations . Variables can :
Let &apos;s start with the following measure definition .
The measure produces the correct result , yet let &apos;s now see how it can be improved .
The measure continues to produce the correct result , and does so in about half the query time .
In the previous measure definition , notice how the choice of variable name makes the RETURN expression simpler to understand . The expression is short and self-describing .
Variables can also help you debug a formula . To test an expression assigned to a variable , you temporarily rewrite the RETURN expression to output the variable .
This article describes how to use the `supportsKeyboardFocus` feature in Power BI visuals .
The `supportsKeyboardFocus` feature allows navigating the data points of the visual using the keyboard only .
This feature requires API v2.1.0 or higher .
This feature can be applied to all visuals except image visuals .
This capability allows the visual to receive focus through keyboard navigation .
Report parameters are case-sensitive and use these special characters :
- A semicolon in any portion of the string is replaced with the characters ` % 3A` .
Browsers should automatically perform the proper URL encoding . You don &apos;t have to encode any of the characters manually .
To set a report parameter within a URL , use the following syntax :

title : Capabilities and properties of Power BI visuals
# Capabilities and properties of Power BI visuals
You use capabilities to provide information to the host about your visual . All properties on the capabilities model are `optional` .
The root objects of a visual &apos;s capabilities are `dataRoles` , `dataViewMappings` , and so on .
# # Define the data fields that your visual expects : dataRoles
* `Grouping` : Discrete values that are used to group measure fields .
* `GroupingOrMeasure` : Values that can be used as either a grouping or a measure .
# # # Valid data types in requiredTypes and preferredTypes
The preceding data roles would create the fields that are displayed in the following image :
# # Define how you want the data mapped : dataViewMappings
A DataViewMappings property describes how the data roles relate to each other and allows you to specify conditional requirements for the them .
Most visuals provide a single mapping , but you can provide multiple dataViewMappings . Each valid mapping produces a data view .
# # Define property pane options : objects
# # Handle partial highlighting : supportsHighlight
# # Handle advanced edit mode : advancedEditModeSupport
# # Data sorting options for visual : sorting

Jan then drags the new Projected Sales measure into the chart .
Quickly and with minimal effort , Jan now has a measure to calculate projected sales . Jan can further analyze the projections by filtering on specific resellers or by adding other fields to the report .
# # Data categories for measures
You can also pick data categories for measures .
Among other things , data categories allow you to use measures to dynamically create URLs , and mark the data category as a Web URL .
Measures have a * Home * table that defines where they &apos;re found in the field list . You can change their location by choosing a location from the tables in your model .

The visualization is getting more interesting , but you can &apos;t see much of the post text in the chart . To show more of the post text :
1 . Use the handles on the chart visualization to resize the chart to be as large as possible .
The chart now shows more of the post content .
The x axis ( number of comments ) of the chart doesn &apos;t show exact values , and looks lost at the bottom of the chart . Let &apos;s use data labels instead :
Now the chart shows the exact number of comments for each post .
# # # Edit the data type
After the changes load , the data labels on the chart become whole numbers .
# # # Create a date slicer
Suppose you want to visualize the number of comments on posts over time . You can create a slicer visualization to filter the chart data to different time frames .

title : Develop with the REST APIs for Power BI Report Server
# Develop with the REST APIs for Power BI Report Server
A REST API request / response pair can be separated into five components :
* HTTP request message header fields :
* Optional additional header fields , as required by the specified URI and HTTP method .
* Optional additional header fields , as required to support the request &apos;s response , such as a `Content-type` response header .
# Work with Model view in Power BI Desktop
# # Numeric control over summarization
Let &apos;s take an example , and demonstrate how to control the way Power BI summarizes numeric data fields .
You can select the type of currency symbol used , by selecting the currency symbol drop down , which is shown in the following image .
There are many different options for formatting fields . For example , you can change the format from currency to percentage .
# # Manage and clarify your location data
These other articles explain how to make specific types of slicers :
# # When to use a slicer
Slicers are a great choice when you want to :
* Display commonly used or important filters on the report canvas for easier access .
* Make it easier to see the current filtered state without having to open a drop-down list .
* Filter by columns that are unneeded and hidden in the data tables .
* Create more focused reports by putting slicers next to important visuals .
Power BI slicers don &apos;t support :
The new slicer is now populated with a list of district manager names and their selection boxes .
# # Control which page visuals are affected by slicers
# # Sync and use slicers on other pages
You can sync a slicer and use it on any or all pages in a report .
This selection causes the * * District Monthly Sales * * slicer to sync across these three pages .
&gt; Although the slicer initially appears on the synced pages at the same size and position as on the original page , you can move , resize , and format synced slicers on the various pages independently .
&gt; If you sync a slicer to a page but don &apos;t make it visible on that page , slicer selections made on the other pages still filter the data on the page .
1 . Select the drop-down arrows next to each category to display and edit the options .
This setting changes the color and thickness of the header and item outlines and underlines .
&gt; Responsive layout changes can override specific heading and item formatting that you set .
Experiment with different item sizes and arrangements , and note how the responsive formatting changes accordingly . These options are available only when you select horizontal orientations .
# # # Selection controls options ( list slicers only )
- For this article , format the title text as follows :
Items options are only available for list slicers .
# # # Date / numeric inputs and slider options
Date / numeric inputs and slider options are only available for range slider slicers .
# # # Other formatting options

title : Optimize reports for the Power BI mobile apps
# Optimize Power BI reports for the mobile app
Power BI provides a number of features to help you create mobile-optimized versions of your reports :
* A mobile layout view where you can create your mobile-optimized report by dragging and dropping visuals onto a phone emulator canvas .
* Visuals and slicers that can be optimized for use on small , mobile screens .
These capabilities make it possible to design and build attractive , interactive mobile-optimized reports .
# # Create a mobile-optimized portrait version of a report page
The first step is to design and create the report in the regular web view . After you &apos;ve created the report , you can optimize it for phones and tablets .
To create the mobile-optimized view , open the mobile layout view :
# # Add visuals to the mobile layout canvas
Visuals can be layered one on top of the other to create interactive reports using bookmarks , or to build attractive reports by layering visuals over images .
The phone report grid scales across phones of different sizes , so your report looks good on small- and large-screen phones .
# # Remove visuals from the mobile layout canvas
You can remove all the visualizations from the canvas by clicking the eraser on the * * Visualization * * pane .
Removing visuals from the mobile layout canvas removes them from the canvas only . The visuals still appear in the visualization pane , and the original report remains unaffected .
# # Configure visuals and slicers for use in mobile-optimized reports
Slicers offer on-canvas filtering of report data . When designing slicers in the regular report authoring mode , you can modify some slicer settings to make them more usable in mobile-optimized reports :
* You can decide whether to allow report readers to select only one item or multiple items .
# # Publish a mobile-optimized report
# # Viewing optimized and unoptimized reports on a phone or tablet
In the Power BI mobile apps , mobile-optimized reports are indicated by a special icon .
On phones , the app automatically detects whether the report is mobile-optimized or not .
* If a mobile-optimized report exists , the app automatically opens the report in mobile-optimized mode .
* If a mobile-optimized report doesn ’ t exist , the report opens in the unoptimized , landscape view .
Holding a phone in landscape orientation opens the report in the unoptimized view with the original report layout , regardless of whether the report is optimized or not .
* For reports with multiple pages , you can optimize all the pages or just a few .
* If you &apos;ve defined a background color for a report page , the mobile-optimized report will have the same background color .
* You can &apos;t modify format settings just for the mobile-optimized report . Formatting is consistent between the master and mobile layouts . For example , the font sizes will be the same .

- Users with a Power BI Pro license
1 . Open the dashboard or report .
A subscription ends in any of these cases :
- The Pro license expires .
- The owner deletes the dashboard or report .
- The user account used to create the subscription is deleted .
Power BI administrators can use the Power BI audit logs to view details around subscriptions . These details include :
- Content Subscribed to
- Modified By /
- Modified Date
- Subscriptions don &apos;t currently support bookmarks .
- For dashboard email subscriptions , if any tiles have row-level security ( RLS ) applied , those tiles don &apos;t display .
- For dashboard subscriptions , certain types of tiles aren &apos;t yet supported . These include : streaming tiles , video tiles , and custom web content tiles .
- Report page subscriptions are tied to the name of the report page . If you subscribe to a report page and then rename it , you have to re-create your subscription .
- Email subscriptions don &apos;t support R-powered custom visuals at this time .
- Email subscriptions are sent with the report &apos;s default filter and slicer states . Any changes to the defaults that you make after subscribing don &apos;t show up in the email . Paginated reports do support this capability and allow you to set the specific parameter values per subscription .
Guidance is divided into four stages . We recommend that you first read the entire article prior to migrating your reports .
Before you start the migration , you should verify that your environment meets certain prerequisites . We &apos;ll describe these prerequisites , and also introduce you to a helpful migration tool .
# # # Preparing for migration
The following list describes the SQL Server versions supported for migration to Power BI :
Migration from Power BI Report Server is possible , too .
The tool automates the following tasks :
* Shared * * data sources * * become embedded data sources
* Shared * * datasets * * become embedded datasets
It doesn &apos;t modify or remove your existing reports . On completion , the tool outputs a summary of all actions completed — successful or unsuccessful .
Over time , the tool may be improved by Microsoft . The community is encouraged to contribute and help enhance it , too .
Having discovered your SSRS instances , the goal of the _ Assess _ phase is to understand any SSRS reports — or server items — that can &apos;t be migrated .
The following SSRS item types , however , can &apos;t be migrated to Power BI :
- Resources , like image files
After preparing your Power BI environment and reports , you &apos;re ready for the _ Migration _ stage .
1 . Open the SSRS portal that contains the reports you want to migrate .
1 . Download each report definition , saving the .rdl files locally .
1 . Preview the report to ensure it renders correctly .
1 . Select the workspace that will contain the report .
There are two options for automated migration . You can use :
- The publicly available APIs for SSRS and Power BI
You can also use the publicly available SSRS and Power BI APIs to automate the migration of your content . While the RDL Migration Tool already uses these APIs , you can develop a custom tool suited to your exact requirements .
For more information about the APIs , see :
# # # Configure data sources
# # # Review report performance
We highly recommended you complete the following actions to ensure the best possible report user experience :
For more information about these issues , including specific steps to understand and mitigate them , see the following articles :
title : Use insights to find where distribution is different ( Preview )
# # Details of the returned results
The visuals displayed are thus intended to clearly show the differences found between the overall distribution ( as seen in the original visual ) and the value with the particular filter applied .
These would get output in column order , as follows :
title : Avoid blank pages when printing paginated reports
# Avoid blank pages when printing paginated reports
Report page size properties determine the page orientation , dimensions , and margins . Access these report properties by :
Ensure all page size properties are correctly configured :
&#124; Page units &#124; Select the relevant units — inches or centimeters . &#124;
&#124; Orientation &#124; Select the correct option — portrait or landscape . &#124;
&#124; Paper size &#124; Select a paper size , or assign custom width and height values . &#124;
A common reason why blank pages are output , is the report body width _ exceeds the available page space _ .
Ensure the width value doesn &apos;t exceed available page width . Be guided by the following formula :
&gt; It &apos;s not possible to reduce the report body width when there are report objects already in the space you want to remove . You must first reposition or resize them before reducing the width .
&gt; Also , the report body width can increase automatically when you add new objects , or resize or reposition existing objects . The report designer always widens the body to accommodate the position and size of its contained objects .
Another reason why a blank page is output , is there &apos;s excess space in the report body , after the last object .
We recommend you always reduce the height of the body to remove any trailing space .
Ensure the * * Add a page break after * * property isn &apos;t unnecessarily enabled .
