# # # Graph Notifications APIs
title : Build Cross-Device Applications
On this site you will find developer documentation for Project Rome and links to other useful resources .
Project Rome allows developers to write apps that can run on multiple devices and travel with the user as they switch between devices .
# # Choosing between native APIs and Graph APIs
* If your app runs on Windows ( UWP or Win32 apps ) , the platform SDK provides a number of additional features , such as using the users &apos; default account and automatically tracking user engagement .
* If you plan to use other Project Rome features that are only available through the platform SDKs , you may wish to implement each of the features in the same way .
Project Rome is currently implemented for the below platforms . Follow the links for samples and SDK downloads .

# # Project Rome blog posts
title : Publishing and reading User Activities ( iOS )
# Implementing User Activities for iOS
With the Project Rome SDK , your iOS app can not only publish User Activities for use in Windows features such as Timeline , but it can also act as an endpoint and read Activities back to the user just as Timeline does . This allows cross-device apps to completely transcend their platforms and present experiences that follow users rather than devices .
See the &#91; API reference &#93; ( api-reference-for-ios.md ) page for links to the reference docs relevant to these scenarios .
# # # Initialize a User Activity channel
At this point , you should have an MCDUserActivityChannel reference in channel .
# # # Create and publish a User Activity
The following sample code shows how a new * * MCDUserActivity * * instance is created .
Once the * * MCDUserActivity * * is populated with this data , the publish operation takes place .
# # Update an existing User Activity
If you have an existing activity and wish to update its information ( in the event of a new engagement , changed page , and so on ) , you can do so by using a * * MCDUserActivitySession * * .
Once you &apos;ve created a session , your app can make any desired changes to the properties of the * * UserActivity * * . When you &apos;re done making changes , close the session .
# # Read User Activities

title : Using Microsoft Graph &apos;s User Activities REST APIs
# Using Microsoft Graph &apos;s User Activities REST APIs
This allows you to create , publish , update , and read Windows-style User Activities from any device capable of making HTTP requests . Microsoft Graph makes these scenarios simpler to implement than on the native platform SDKs , but it does not support all of the Project Rome features or provide a native object model .
* Provide app IDs – provide app IDs for each of the platform where your app has a presence .
&gt; For Android apps , this is the Package Name you assigned to your app when you created the project . The Package Name can be found in your Firebase console under Project Overview - &gt; General .
# Implementing User Activities for Android
See the &#91; API reference &#93; ( api-reference-for-android.md ) page for links to the reference docs relevant to these scenarios .
You will also need your cross-platform app ID , which was retrieved through the Microsoft Developer Dashboard registration .
The following methods initialize a UserActivityChannel .
At this point , you should have a UserActivityChannel reference in mActivityChannel .
Next , provide a method that creates a new * * UserActivity * * instance .
Once you have the * * UserActivity * * instance , populate it with the data defined above .
Finally , publish the Activity to the cloud .
# # # Update an existing User Activity
If you have an existing Activity and wish to update its information ( in the event of a new engagement , changed page , and so on ) , you can do so by using a * * UserActivitySession * * .
# # # Read User Activities
Your notification scenarios should be designed in a &quot; human-centric &quot; way , in which the primary goal is to notify the user , wherever they are . Existing notification solutions provided by major platforms are excellent at targeting devices . Microsoft Graph notifications improve on this by allowing you to target users . Microsoft Graph notifications will take care of the heavy lifting , including mapping between users and endpoints , syncing notification state across users &apos; different endpoints , and more .
# # Why integrate with Microsoft Graph Notifications ?
# # # Manage notifications across endpoints
# # # Retrieve notification history
# # Integrating with Microsoft Graph Notifications
To get started with client-side Graph Notifications integration and start receiving and managing notifications using the native SDKs , select your preferred development platform on the left navigation pane .
The process of receiving MSGraph notifications is aligned across different development platforms . Based on the SDK language difference , we have separate guidelines . Select a platform below to learn how to enable notification retrieval in your app .

# # Office 365 Service Communications API ( preview )
New features are only added to the new version of the API , encouraging early adoption by legacy customers . When the General Announcement of Office 365 Service Communications API was made , the older version of the Service Communications API began a period of deprecation .
# # Office 365 Management Activity API
title : Welcome to Office 365 Management APIs
The Office 365 Management APIs provide a single extensibility platform for all Office 365 customers &apos; and partners &apos; management tasks , including service communications , security , compliance , reporting , and auditing .
# # In this section
# Troubleshooting the Office 365 Management Activity API
- Allows programmatic access to multiple auditing pipeline workloads ( such as SharePoint and Exchange )
# # Questions about third-party tools and clients
# # Enabling unified audit logging in Office 365
# # Connecting to the API
# # # Azure application permissions
The three permissions currently used for the Office 365 Management Activity API are :
1 . Read activity data for your organization
2 . Read service health information for your organization
3 . Read Data Loss Prevention ( DLP ) policy events , including detected sensitive information
# # # Getting an access token
- Enterprise plan and GCC government plan : `manage.office.com`
- GCC High government plan : `manage.office365.us`
- DoD government plan : `manage.protection.apps.mil`
The ` $ oauth` variable will contain the response object , which has several properties including the access token . Here ’ s an example of a response :
# # Checking your subscriptions
# # # # Sample response
# # Creating a new subscription
To create a new subscription , you use the / start operation . For the API endpoint , use one of these values base on your subscription plan :
# # Checking content availability
# # # Paging contents for busy tenants
Before you add a webhook , be aware of the following two issues :
To add a subscription with a webhook endpoint , add a body parameter to the POST to the / start endpoint ; for example :
# # # Checking notifications to webhooks
# # Requesting content blobs and throttling
Note the following things about the * $ uri * variable in the previous example :
- We used single quotes so that the * $ * symbols aren ’ t interpreted as variables in PowerShell
When attempting to retrieve the available content blobs , many customers ( mostly working with busy tenants ) have experienced errors that look like this :
# # # # Aren ’ t webhook notifications more immediate ? After all , aren ’ t they are event-driven ?
# # # # How long will the content blobs remain available ?
title : Get started with Office 365 Management APIs
# Get started with Office 365 Management APIs
# # Register your application in Azure AD
After you have a Microsoft tenant with the proper subscriptions , you can register your application in Azure AD .
7 . Enter the appropriate App properties :
# # # Configure your application properties in Azure AD
Now that your application is registered , there are several important properties you must specify that determine how your application functions within Azure AD and how tenant admins will grant consent to allow your application to access their data by using the Office 365 Management APIs .
Be sure to choose * * Save * * after making any changes to these properties .
# # # Generate a new key for your application
Keys , also known as client secrets , are used when exchanging an authorization code for an access token .
3 . Azure displays the app secret only after saving it . Select the Clipboard icon to copy the client secret to the Clipboard .
You must configure an X.509 certificate with your application to be used as client credentials when requesting app-only access tokens from Azure AD . There are two steps to the process :
1 . From the command line , run the following :
&gt; When you are generating the X.509 certificate , make sure the key length is at least 2048 . Shorter key lengths are not accepted as valid keys .
2 . Open the Certificates MMC snap-in and connect to your user account .
&gt; You can use Windows PowerShell to extract the thumbprint and base64-encoded public key . Other platforms provide similar tools to retrieve properties of certificates .
4 . From the Windows PowerShell prompt , type and run the following :
Using the values extracted from the certificate and the generated key ID , you must now update your application manifest in Azure AD .
8 . Open the downloaded manifest for editing and replace the empty KeyCredentials property with the following JSON :
# # # Specify the permissions your app requires to access the Office 365 Management APIs
Finally , you need to specify exactly what permissions your app requires of the Office 365 Management APIs . To do so , you add access to the Office 365 Management APIs to your app , and then you specify the permission ( s ) you need .
Now that your application is configured with the permissions it needs to use the Office 365 Management APIs , a tenant admin must explicitly grant your application these permissions in order to access their tenant &apos;s data by using the APIs . To grant consent , the tenant admin must sign in to Azure AD by using the following specially constructed URL , where they can review your application &apos;s requested permissions . This step is not required when using the APIs to access data from your own tenant .
The redirect URL must match or be a sub-path under one of the Reply URLs configured for your application in Azure AD .
You can test the consent URL by pasting it into a browser and signing in using the credentials of an Office 365 admin for a tenant other than the tenant that you used to register the application . You will see the request to grant your application permission to use the Office Management APIs .
After choosing * * Accept * * , you are redirected to the specified page , and there will be a code in the query string .
Your application uses this authorization code to obtain an access token from Azure AD , from which the tenant ID can be extracted . After you have extracted and stored the tenant ID , you can obtain subsequent access tokens without requiring the tenant admin to sign in .
# # Request access tokens from Azure AD
There are two methods for requesting access tokens from Azure AD :
The body of the POST contains the following :
# # # # Sample request
# # # # Sample token
# # # # Sample JWT token
# # # # Sample access token
# # Build your app
The Office 365 Management Activity API aggregates actions and events into tenant-specific content blobs , which are classified by the type and source of the content they contain . Currently , these content types are supported :
- Audit.General ( includes all other workloads not included in the previous content types )
- DLP.All ( DLP events only for all workloads )
Because the notifications we send to your webhook include the tenant ID , you can use the same webhook to receive notifications for all tenants .
* * Enterprise plan and GCC government plan * *
The Activity API supports the following operations :
- * * Start a subscription * * to begin receiving notifications and retrieving activity data for a tenant .
- * * Stop a subscription * * to discontinue retrieving data for a tenant .
- * * List available content * * and the corresponding content URLs .
- * * Receiving notifications * * sent by a webhook when new content is available .
- * * List notifications * * sent by a webhook .
- * * Retrieve resource friendly names * * for objects in the data feed identified by guids .
# # Start a subscription
- Re-enable an expired webhook by specifying a later or null expiration date .
- Remove a webhook .
&#124; &#124; Subscription &#124; Description &#124;
&#124; * * Parameters * * &#124; contentType &#124; Must be a valid content type . &#124;
&#124; * * Response * * &#124; contentType &#124; The content type specified in the call . &#124;
&#124; &#124; status &#124; The status of the subscription . If a subscription is disabled , you will not be able to list or retrieve content . &#124;
&#124; &#124; webhook &#124; The webhook properties specified in the call together with the status of the webhook . If the webhook is disabled , you will not receive notification , but you will still be able to list and retrieve content , provided the subscription is enabled . &#124;
# # Stop a subscription
&#124; * * Body * * &#124; ( empty ) &#124; &#124;
&#124; * * Response * * &#124; ( empty ) &#124; &#124; &#124;
To list all available content for a specified time range , you might need to retrieve multiple pages until a response without the * * NextPageUri * * header is received .
# # Notification failure and retry
To retrieve a content blob , make a GET request against the corresponding content URI that is included in the list of available content and in the notifications sent to a webhook . The returned content will be a collection of one more actions or events in JSON format .
You can use this operation to help investigate issues related to webhooks and notifications , but you should not use it to determine what content is currently available for retrieval . Use the / content operation instead . We return an error if the subscription status is disabled .
To list all available content for a specified time range , you might need to retrieve multiple pages until a response without the * * NextPageUrl * * header is received .
# # Retrieve resource friendly names
This operation retrieves friendly names for objects in the data feed identified by guids . Currently &quot; DlpSensitiveType &quot; is the only supported object .
Organizations that access auditing logs through the Office 365 Management Activity API were restricted by throttling limits at the publisher level . This means that for a publisher pulling data on behalf of multiple customers , the limit was shared by all those customers .
When the service encounters an error , it will report the error response code to the caller , using standard HTTP error-code syntax . . Additional information is included in the body of the failed call as a single JSON object . An example of a full JSON error body is shown below :
&#124; Code &#124; Message &#124;
&#124; AF20020 &#124; The specified content type is not valid . &#124;
&#124; AF20022 &#124; No subscription found for the specified content type . &#124;
&#124; AF20030 &#124; Start time and end time must both be specified ( or both omitted ) and must be less than or equal to 24 hours apart , with the start time no more than 7 days in the past . &#124;
&#124; AF20053 &#124; Only one language may be present in the Accept-Language header . &#124;
&#124; AF20054 &#124; Invalid syntax in Accept-Language header . &#124;
&#124; AF50000 &#124; An internal error occurred . Retry the request . &#124;

title : Inventory locations
For each location , the place where the item is inserted can also be specified . By default , they are the same . Items are usually inserted and drawn from the same side of a location , but not always . For example , items that are stored in live storage racks are inserted from one aisle and drawn from another . The main input is given by a location name , which is usually determined by its coordinates : warehouse , aisle , rack , shelf , and bin . This name or ID can be entered manually or generated from the location coordinates — for example , 01-02-03-4 for aisle 1 , rack 2 , shelf 3 , bin 4 in the Inventory locations page .
- Size ( height , width , depth , and thereby volume )
- Location type ( bulk location , picking location , inbound dock , outbound dock , production input location , inspection location , or kanban supermarket )
In the Inventory locations page , you can view the warehouse layout in a tree structure based on the coordinates of inventory locations , in a defined display format .

title : Retail sales price management
# Retail sales price management
&#124; Term &#124; Definition , usage , and notes &#124;
&#124; Price &#124; The single unit amount that a product sells for in a point of sale ( POS ) client or on a sales order . In this topic , the term * price * always refers to the sales price , not the inventory price or cost price . &#124;
&#124; Base price &#124; The price that is set in the * * Price * * field on a released product . &#124;
Loyalty programs have additional functionality besides prices and discounts . However , from the perspective of pricing and discounts , they are the same as affiliations .
# # # Best practices for price groups
For this example , we will drill into the North east region . Store 1 is in Boston , and store 2 is in Manhattan . For the Boston store , two price groups are linked to the channel : North East and Store 1 . For the Manhattan store , three price groups are linked to the channel : North East , NYC , and Store 2 .
Two products that the retailer sells are product 1 , a commodity T-shirt , and product 2 , brand-specific fashion jeans .
&#124; Product &#124; North East price &#124; NYC price &#124; Store price &#124;
&#124; T-shirt &#124; $ 15 &#124; Not set &#124; Not set &#124;
&#124; Fashion jeans &#124; $ 50 &#124; $ 70 &#124; Not set &#124;
# # Types of prices
In Microsoft Dynamics 365 , you can set the price of a product in three places :
- Directly on the product ( base price )
# # # Sales price trade agreement
- In the * * Price basis * * field , select the type of price to modify :
- Retail processes variant-specific prices in order from most specific to least specific . If a product dimension doesn &apos;t affect the price , you don &apos;t have to define trade agreements for it . For example , a product is available in three colors and four sizes , but the price varies only by size . If you define a trade agreement for every variant , you create 12 records . Instead , you can define a trade agreement just for each size and leave the Color dimension blank . In this case , you produce only four records .
# # Differences between retail pricing and non-retail pricing
In addition , * * only * * the retail pricing engine supports the following pricing features :
- The price is based on product dimensions , in order from the most-specific variant price to the least-specific variant price to the product master price . A price that is set by using two product dimensions ( for example , Color and Size ) is used before a price that is set by using only one product dimension ( for example , Size ) .

# # # Example of a registered break
&gt; The time for the break runs in parallel with the time for the activity ( a production job , in this example ) . This behavior is always used for break activities . When the registrations are calculated , the break time is subtracted from the activity time . In this case , the production job has a duration of 10.50 hours , but the time is calculated as 10 because 0.5 hours of break time are subtracted from the activity time .

Setting up the media base URL and defining media templates to configure the format for image URLs
# # # Define the media template for an entity
4 . For images , the file name format is hard-coded to the catalog name and can &apos;t be changed . Therefore , rename your images so that they have appropriate catalog names , to help guarantee that MPOS handles them correctly .
# # # Overwrite by using Edit in Excel
9 . After you sign in , you should be able to see the list of image URLs for the various catalog entries .
10 . You edit , add , and remove the image URLs for various entity items .
14 . Run the appropriate synchronization jobs for the entity , and check the preview on the entity page or in MPOS .
# # # # Creating new records
# # # # Deleting an existing record
# # # Overwrite from the entity-level Preview page
For all entities except Products , you can overwrite the image URL for a given entity item at the entity item level from the * * Preview * * page . For Products , you can use the &quot; Catalog Products &quot; entity page . This example shows how to overwrite a catalog image .
To overwrite image URLs for catalog product images , you must use the * * Preview * * page . You can &apos;t use the Edit in Excel functionality .
MPOS can run in Online mode ( when MPOS connected to Retail Server ) or Offline mode ( when there is no Retail Server or network connectivity , and transactions are stored in a local offline database ) . When MPOS runs in Offline mode , it can &apos;t get images from the external image server to display from Retail Server , because Retail Server connectivity has been lost . However , you can still set up images so that they are shown when MPOS runs in Offline mode .
2 . Select the product to set the offline image for .
5 . Save and close the page .
6 . While MPOS is in Online mode , run the Catalog job in HQ , to make sure that the data is sent at least one time to the offline database .
# # # Set up catalog , category , employee , and customer images to appear in Offline mode for MPOS
4 . Run the Catalog job . This image will now be used as the Offline image for that catalog in MPOS .

title : Project contracts
In Finance and Operations , you can split the billing for a single transaction or an entire project among multiple customers , grants , or organizations .
- Configure funding rules and funding limits for each worker , item , category , category group , and transaction type ( or for all transaction types ) .
&lt; td &gt; You want to allocate costs to one funding source until its funds are exhausted , allocate costs to a second funding source until its funds are exhausted , and finally allocate the remaining costs to a third funding source . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; li &gt; Funding source 1 &lt; / li &gt;
&lt; li &gt; Funding source 2 &lt; / li &gt;
&lt; li &gt; Funding source 3 &lt; / li &gt;
&lt; td &gt; You want to allocate 75 percent of costs to one funding source and 25 percent to a second funding source . When either of those funding sources is exhausted , you want to pay the remaining costs from a third funding source . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; You want to allocate 75 percent of costs to one funding source and 25 percent to a second funding source . When either of those funding sources is exhausted , you want to split the remaining costs between a third funding source and a fourth funding source . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; li &gt; Funding source 4 &lt; / li &gt;
&lt; td &gt; You want to allocate the first 25 percent of costs to one funding source and the rest to a second funding source . &lt; / td &gt;
2 . Continue to use funding source 3 until it is exhausted .
3 . Use funding source 1 after funding source 3 is exhausted .
To accomplish this goal , you must do the following :
- Set up funding limits for funding source 2 and funding source 3 , for their respective amounts .
- Create the following funding rules :
- Rule 2 ( Priority 2 ) : Allocate 100 percent of transactions to funding source 3 .
- Rule 3 ( Priority 3 ) : Allocate 100 percent of transactions to funding source 1 .
This setup works because transactions are checked against rules and limits to determine whether any of them apply to the transaction . If no specific rules or limits apply to the transaction , the All transactions rule applies . The All transactions rule matches all transactions .
&lt; td &gt; Funding rules &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Funding limits &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Transaction 1 &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; li &gt; Funding source 2 : 50.00 &lt; / li &gt;
&lt; li &gt; Funding source 3 : 50.00 &lt; / li &gt;
&lt; li &gt; Funding source 2 : 450.00 &lt; / li &gt;
&lt; li &gt; Funding source 3 : 450.00 &lt; / li &gt;
&lt; strong &gt; Rule 2 &lt; / strong &gt;
&lt; strong &gt; Rule 3 &lt; / strong &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Total funds that are distributed for each funding source &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; li &gt; Funding source 1 : 3,850.00 &lt; / li &gt;
&lt; li &gt; Funding source 2 : 500.00 &lt; / li &gt;
&lt; li &gt; Funding source 3 : 750.00 &lt; / li &gt;
# # # Example : Create a billing rule that is based on the number of units delivered
- The unit price is 10,000 per training session .
# # # Example : Create a billing rule that is based on a specified percentage of project completion ( manual calculation )
- You create an invoice for 15,000 ( 15 percent of 100,000 ) and send it to the customer .
# # # Example : Create a billing rule that is based on a specified percentage of project completion ( automatic calculation )
- You create an invoice for 8,667 and send it to the customer .
# # # Example : Create a billing rule that is based on agreed-upon milestones
- Milestone 1 : Collect consumer data – March 31
- Milestone 2 : Analyze consumer data – April 30
- Milestone 3 : Present a product viability proposal – May 31
The customer agrees to pay your organization 10,000 for the first milestone , 20,000 for the second milestone , and 20,000 for the third milestone .
When the first milestone is completed on March 31 , you mark the milestone as completed , and then create an invoice for 10,000 and send it to the customer . You can ’ t create an invoice for a milestone until you have marked the milestone as completed .
# # # Example : Create a billing rule that is based on services plus a management fee
- Total invoice amount = 22,000
# # # Example : Create a billing rule for the value of time and materials
- The contract period is six months .
- Consulting time is calculated at a rate of 150 per hour .

# Leave and absence management
- * * Define leave and absence types . * *
Leave types define the various types of absences that employees can report . Because these types are user-defined , they can be tailored to your organization . Some typical leave types include paid time off ( PTO ) , leave , short-term disability , jury duty ( this leave type is specific to the United States ) , and bereavement .
- * * Define leave and absence plans that are tiered to fit your business . * *
Typical leave plans include tiered plans that grant a benefit of 80 hours of PTO to new employees but a benefit of 120 hours after 60 months of service . Additional plans might grant floating holidays or position-based benefits , such as executive-only benefit hours .
- * * Suspend leave and absence plans . * *
- * * Adjust entitlements and grants . * *
- * * Apply a workflow to time-off requests . * *
- * * Track employee absence balances . * *
title : VAT recovery in Expense management
To receive refunds on eligible value-added tax ( VAT ) transactions , a company or organization must identify , collect , verify , and submit accurate information . This process includes multiple tasks and , depending on the size of your company , can include several employees or roles .
2 . Make sure that all tax information is complete , and then post the expense report .
3 . Process expenses that are eligible for international VAT recovery .
5 . Process expenses for domestic VAT recovery .
# # On an expense report , enter tax information about credit card transactions to identify eligible VAT refunds
# # Make sure that all tax information is complete , and then post the expense report
When Arnie receives the paper receipts from Nancy , he verifies the paper receipts against the digital receipts and then changes the status of the expense report to * * Ready for recovery * * .
# # Send VAT recovery data to the third-party vendor to file international recovery returns
title : Vendor posting profiles
# # Creating a posting profile
&#124; * * Table * * &#124; Specific vendor account &#124; 1 &#124;
&#124; * * Group * * &#124; vendor group that is assigned to the vendor &#124; 2 &#124;
&#124; * * All * * &#124; Blank &#124; 3 &#124;
If you want all vendor transactions to have the same posting profile , set up only one posting profile with All in the Account code field . Specify the following values to set up your posting profile :
&lt; td &gt; Enter a code for the posting profile . For example , you could create two posting profiles to obtain one account for vendor balances in the national currency and another for vendor balances in a foreign currency . You could call one account National and the other Foreign . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Enter a description of the posting profile . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; If Table is selected in the Account code field , select the account number of the vendor that is associated with the posting profile . If Group is selected , select a vendor group . If All is selected , leave this field blank . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; If the Use posting definitions toggle is selected in the General ledger parameters page , the transaction posting definition for vendor invoices is used instead of the summary account . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; The posting profile that is used when the payment is marked as a prepayment is selected in the Posting profile with prepayment journal voucher field in the Ledger and sales tax area of the Accounts payable parameters page . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Select the ledger account that information about unapproved vendor invoices is posted to . The information is entered in the Invoice register journal . For example , a user enters very basic information about vendor invoices when they are received in the invoice register . When the invoice register is posted , the transactions are posted to the account that is entered here and in the Offset account field . When the invoices are approved , the debt is transferred from the Arrival account to the vendor summary account . &lt; / td &gt;
&#124; * * Settlement * * &#124; Select this option to enable automatic settlement of transactions that have this posting profile . If this option is cleared , you must manually settle transactions by using the Settle open transactions page . &#124;
&#124; * * Cancel * * &#124; Select this option if you want to be able to cancel transactions that have this posting profile . &#124;
&#124; * * Close * * &#124; Select a posting profile to change to when transactions that have this posting profile are closed . A transaction is regarded as closed when it has been settled in full . &#124;

title : Routes and operations
- You can &apos;t use 0 ( zero ) as the operation number . That number is reserved and is used to specify that the last operation in the route has no successor operation .
# # # Approval of routes
Each route can be approved or unapproved separately . However , note that , when a route is unapproved , all related route versions are also unapproved . In the Production control parameters , you can specify whether routes can be unapproved , and whether approved routes can be changed .
An operation is a step in the production process . In Finance and Operations , each operation has an ID and a simple description . The following tables shows typical examples of operations from a machine shop .
&#124; Operation &#124; Description &#124;
&#124; PipeCut &#124; Pipe cutting &#124;
&#124; TIGweld &#124; TIG welding &#124;
&#124; JigAssy &#124; Jig assembly &#124;
&#124; Inspection &#124; Quality inspection &#124;
The operational properties of the operation , such as the setup time and run time , resource requirements , costing information , and consumption calculation , are specified on the operation relation . ( For more information about operation relations , see the next section . )
&#124; All &#124; &#124; All &#124; &#124; The default operational properties of an operation . These operational properties apply when a more specific operation relation doesn &apos;t exist . &#124;
* * Note : * * Because the operational properties are stored in operation relations per operation per route , all occurrences of the same operation ( for example , Assembly ) have the same setup time , run time , resource requirements , and so on . Therefore , if two occurrences of an operation must occur in the same route but have different run times , you must create two distinct operations , such as Assembly1 and Assembly2 .
# # # Modifying product-specific routes
You can also manually create an operation that is specific to a route and released product by using the * * Copy and edit relation * * function .
# # # Maintaining operation relations per route
# # # Maintaining operation relations per operation
# # # Applying operation relations
- Product dimensions ( size , color , style , or configuration )
In the Production control parameters , you can require that the validity period of a route version always be specified .
# # # Approval of route versions
# # # Product change that uses case management
# # # Making routes independent of resources
For more information about the various types of resource requirements and how to use them , see Operations resource requirements and &#91; Resource capabilities &#93; ( resource-capabilities.md ) .
# # # Sharing routes across sites
# # # Standard operation relations
When you use this approach , the * * Operation relations * * page becomes your primary destination for maintaining run times and other properties .

# Generate and process customer rebates
1 . Go to Sales and marketing &gt; Customer rebates &gt; Rebate agreements .
* The agreement is for an individual customer , in this example customer US-009 .
* Rebates are given to the customer when they purchase a specific product . In this case , the product has item number T0020 .
* The setting for “ Price taken from ” is Gross , which means that line &apos;s sales amount on which basis the claim is estimated is not reduced by the line discount .
* The Rebate line break type field shows the method for calculating rebates . In this case , the sales target against which the rebates are to be estimated is set to Quantity .
* The agreement &apos;s lines specify the rebate amount type , the actual rebate value , and the thresholds . In this example , the customer will qualify for a rebate of 20 USD per unit sold , if their weekly purchases of the product fall within 1 to 50 units ; and a rebate of 40 USD per unit sold , if they purchase above 50 units .
# # Generate rebate claims

* The first line represents a rebate claim for 800 USD , which is based on the sales of 40 units of product T0020 , calculated at 20 USD per unit . This matches the conditions of the first quantity break in the rebate agreement .
* The second claim is for 2,400 USD , which is based on the sales of 60 units of product T0020 , calculated at 40 USD per unit , as per the second quantity break in the agreement .

# Fiscal calendars , fiscal years , and periods
Fiscal calendars provide a framework for the financial activity of an organization . Each fiscal calendar contains one or more fiscal years , and each fiscal year contains multiple periods . Fiscal calendars can be based on a January 1 to December 31 calendar year , or on any dates that you select . For example , some organizations select a fiscal calendar that starts on July 1 of one year and ends on June 30 of the following year .
When you create a closing period , select a period that has a status of Open and that has the dates that you want to use . The new closing period will copy the starting and ending dates from the existing period . The original period will continue to exist . For example , you select Period 12 , which is the last period in the fiscal year , and that has dates of August 1 through August 31 . You enter a name for the closing period , such as Close . After you create the new closing period , you now have the original period and the closing period . Both have dates that start on August 1 and end on August 31 .

Traditionally , this scenario has been used most often . It &apos;s still extensively used . In a &quot; fixed till &quot; shift , the shift and till are associated with a specific register . They aren &apos;t moved from one register to another . A &quot; fixed till &quot; shift can be used by a single user or shared among multiple users . &quot; Fixed till &quot; shifts don &apos;t require any special configuration .
# # Shift and drawer operations
# # # Declare start amount
# # # Blind close shift
* Blind-closed shifts * are no longer active but haven &apos;t been fully closed . Unlike suspended shifts , blind-closed shifts can &apos;t be resumed . However , operations such as Declare start amount and Tender declaration can be performed on them later or from a different register .

title : Purchasing policies
# # Assigning policies to organizations
# # Determining which rule to apply
# # # Example 1 : Simple purchasing policy configuration
Organizations that are small and less complex can set up purchasing policies by legal entity , and can use only the Companies organization hierarchy .
When an employee in legal entity 2222 creates a purchase requisition , the policy rules are derived from policy B .
In the previous example , all purchasing rules were defined in a single organization hierarchy , the Companies organization hierarchy . However , a complex organization might define policies for multiple organization hierarchies .
1 . Global purchasing control
Therefore , policy 456 is applied to the purchase requisition that Sam creates , and no minimum order quantity is required for the purchase requisition .
# # # Category access policy rule
# # # Purchase requisition RFQ rule
The purchase requisition RFQ rule defines criteria for requiring a request for quotation ( RFQ ) for a purchase requisition line . If a line meets the conditions , the &quot; informal RFQ &quot; or &quot; formal RFQ &quot; stamp appears on the requisition line .
# # # Purchase requisition control rule
- On the * * Order quantities * * tab , you can configure the fields that are required on the purchase requisition under certain conditions . You can also enforce order quantities .
- On the * * Dates * * tab , you can configure whether the accounting date is the same as the requested date
- On the * * Address * * tab , you can define whether the user is allowed to create new addresses in the system to apply to the purchase requisition .
# # # Replenishment category access policy rule
# # # Purchase order creation and demand consolidation rule
- On the * * Purchase order split * * tab , you can define criteria for splitting purchase requisition lines onto separate purchase orders .
- On the * * Item description transfer * * tab , you can transfer the item description from the requisition when it originates from an RFQ .
- On the * * Error processing * * tab , you can configure the processing rule that is applied to a purchase requisition if it fails validation during purchase order creation because of a vendor error or a price tolerance error . Select one of the following options :
- On the * * Demand consolidation * * tab , you can define the parameters that determine whether purchase requisitions that are manually processed can be considered for purchase requisition consolidation . The parameters can apply to internal catalog items , external catalog items , or non-catalog items . Select one of the following options :

# # Create customized configurations for FTI printable forms
As part of your customized solution for printable FTI forms , you must create a set of ER configurations .
# # # Configure the ER data model
# # # Configure the ER model mapping
- Data source type : * * Table records * *
- It must refer to the CustInvoiceJour application table .
In your application instance , you must have the ER format configuration that will be used to generate FTI forms .
# # Configure print management
4 . Select the ER format for the specified document level .
FTI forms are generated in the ER framework in the same way that SSRS reports are generated .
To generate FTI forms , you can select invoices either by range or by selection .
&gt; When you use ER formats to print FTI forms in this way , the default ER file destinations are used . You can change the default destination at runtime if the destination has already been configured . To change the destination , you must have the following security privilege :
&gt; - * * Label : * * Maintain electronic reporting format destination during runtime
# # Download sample ER configurations to generate printable FTI forms
- The * * Customer invoicing model * * configuration contains the required data model and model mapping .
In the sample ER format configuration , an Excel file is used as a template to generate FTI forms .
Currently , this sample ER format supports the following features to generate FTI forms :
- Depending on the Print management settings , generated invoices include custom footer text when it has been configured for the invoice language , the ER format , and the FTI document scope .
In addition to the generated invoice form , Giro money transfer slips can be generated as follows :
The * * Emailing.TxtToUse.Body * * expression of the sample format is configured for the following substitutions for placeholders :

# # # POS platform and form factor considerations
Retail supports the following POS options :
- The user interface ( UI ) is consistent , regardless of the platform or form factor .
- In a given store , the POS variations can be combined and can run concurrently . For example , for its main registers , a retailer can use MPOS on computers that run Windows . However , the retailer can supplement those registers with browser-based terminals or mobile devices .
# # # MPOS vs. CPOS
Although MPOS and CPOS are largely the same , there are some important differences that you must understand .
MPOS on a Windows , iOS , or Android device is an application that is packaged , installed , and serviced on that device .
Because CPOS runs in a browser , the application isn &apos;t installed on the device . Instead , the browser accesses the application code from the CPOS server . Therefore , CPOS can &apos;t directly access POS hardware or work in an offline state .
# # # Store deployment considerations
&#124; POS application &#124; Retail server &#124; Available offline &#124;
&#124; MPOS for Windows &#124; Cloud or RSSU &#124; Yes &#124;
&#124; MPOS for iOS or Android &#124; Cloud or RSSU &#124; No &#124;
&#124; Cloud POS &#124; Cloud or RSSU &#124; No &#124;
# # # # Offline mode
- Use MPOS in Windows , and enable offline mode .
- Deploy an on-premises RSSU .

This topic describes features that are either new or changed in Dynamics 365 for Operations version 1611 .
&lt; th &gt; What you can do &lt; / th &gt;
&lt; th &gt; Why this is important &lt; / th &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Define cost element dimensions , and import cost element dimension members . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Map cost element dimensions . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Define cost object dimensions , and import cost object dimension members . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Define or import statistical dimensions . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Statistical dimension members are measured in nonmonetary units , such as machine hours , number of employees , and square . They are used in statements , or as the basis for allocations and distributions . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Create statistical measure provider templates . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Create cost accounting ledgers . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Create cost control units . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Cost control units make up the cost structure and define the flow of costs in a cost accounting ledger . They must be associated with cost object dimensions to represent the cost object dimensions in the ledger . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Process general ledger entries . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; To measure actual performance , you must have data . The data is imported by using the connectors that you define for the cost accounting ledger . When you process the general ledger entries , the data is imported incrementally . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Process budget entries . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; To measure budgeted performance , you must have data . The data is imported by using the connectors that you define for the cost accounting ledger . When you process the budget entries , the data is imported incrementally . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Create and apply cost behavior policies . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; You use a cost behavior policy to classify costs as fixed , variable , or semi-variable . A policy is rule-based and date-effective . By default , all costs are marked as unclassified until you apply a cost behavior policy and calculate the effects of the rule . After the calculation , the costs are classified . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Trace costs . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Define dimension hierarchies . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; li &gt; You define allocations , cost rates , and cost rollup rules . &lt; / li &gt;
&lt; li &gt; You view statements by using the workspace . &lt; / li &gt;
&lt; li &gt; You define access to view aggregated data . &lt; / li &gt;
&lt; li &gt; You view data in Excel . &lt; / li &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Create statements that can be viewed in the workspace . &lt; / td &gt;
&#124; What you can do &#124; Why this is important &#124;
&lt; td &gt; Track fixed asset valuations by using a single “ book ” concept . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Perform the General ledger year-end close for multiple legal entities . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Take advantage of enhancements to General ledger foreign currency revaluation . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; View transactions for additional posting layers . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Attach how-to documentation to the financial period close template . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Previously , you could attach documentation after a task was completed . For example , you could attach a report that was generated . You can now also attach a how-to document to the template . This how-to document is then copied to every task in the financial period schedule , so that the task owner can view instructions about how to complete the task . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Define the intercompany accounting setup from a shared page . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Submit justification documents for budget plans . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Enable advanced rules for budget register entries . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; If advanced rules are configured in General ledger , those rules can be used for new entries and transfers in the budget register . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Take advantage of enhanced visibility of prepayment invoicing activity . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Switch legal entities during invoice entry . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Settlement enhancements &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Enhancements help payment clerks do settlement more efficiently , because clerks can allow multiple unposted payments to be settled against the same invoice . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Cross-company view &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Import electronic bank statements for all legal entities in a single step . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Valuation tracking &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Take advantage of enhancements to cross-company depreciation runs . &lt; / td &gt;
# # Human capital management
&#124; Create goal groups , and use them to add new goals . &#124; You can add goal templates to a group , and use the group to create one or more goals for an employee , a team , a position , a department , or the company . &#124;

title : Calculations for product configuration models FAQ
# Calculations for product configuration models FAQ
Calculations can be used for arithmetic or logical operations . They complement expression constraints in product configuration models . You can define calculations on the * * Constraint-based product configuration model details * * page and then build expressions for the calculations in the expression editor . For more information , see Create calculations .
# # What is a calculation ?
Like a constraint , a calculation is associated with a specific component in a product configuration model , and can ’ t be reused by or shared with another component . One important difference between calculations and constraints is that calculations are imperative ( unidirectional ) , whereas constraints are declarative ( bi-directional ) . For more information about constraints , see &#91; Expression constraints and table constraints &#93; ( expression-constraints-table-constraints-product-configuration-models.md ) .
# # What is a target attribute ?
# # Can the value of a target attribute restrict the values of the input attributes in a calculation ?
# # What happens if a calculation has a target attribute of the integer type but a calculation generates a decimal number ?
If a target attribute is of the integer type , but a calculation generates a decimal number , only the integer part of the calculated result is returned . The decimal part is removed , and the result isn &apos;t rounded . For example , a result of 12.70 is shown as 12 .
# # How do I set a target attribute as hidden or read-only ?
# # Why do I receive an error message that says that my model is in contradiction ?
# # Why do I receive an error message even though I successfully validated my product model ?

- They have never been brokered by DOM .
- They have been brokered by DOM before , but they are marked as exceptions and are below the maximum threshold for attempts .
- They aren &apos;t marked for delivery .
- They aren &apos;t manually excluded .
# # Results of DOM runs
# # Order line actions and statuses
# # Run a clean-up job for DOM fulfillment plans
As DOM processing is run , fulfillment plans are created . Over time , the system will keep numerous fulfillment plans . To manage the number of fulfillment plans that the system keeps , you can configure a batch job that deletes older fulfillment plans , based on the * * Retention period in days * * value .

title : Actions in workflow approval processes
A workflow can involve several groups of people : the originator , task assignees , decision makers , and approvers . For example , in the following expense report workflow , Sam is the originator , the members of the queue are task assignees , John is a decision maker , and Frank , Sue , and Ann are approvers .
# # Actions that an originator can perform
# # Actions that a task assignee can perform
The members of the Adventure Works Expense Reports department monitor the queue . Julie , a member of that department , has accepted the task of reviewing Sam &apos;s expense report and receipts . She can now perform one of the following actions : complete , reject , delegate , request change , reassign , or release .
* * Note : * * The actions that are available vary , depending on how the software developer designed the task .
When a user rejects a document , the workflow process ends .
For example , Julie , a member of the Adventure Works Expense Reports department , has accepted the task of reviewing Sam ’ s expense report and receipts . If Julie rejects the expense report , the workflow process ends .
Sam can then resubmit the expense report . He can make changes first , or he can resubmit the original version . If Sam resubmits the expense report , the workflow process starts at the manual review task .
Tim then acts on behalf of Julie . Therefore , when Tim completes his review , the expense report is assigned to John , just as if Julie had completed the task .
# # Actions that a decision maker can perform
For example , Sam &apos;s expense report is assigned to John . John delegates the decision to Maria , who is his assistant .
# # Actions that an approver can perform
When a document is assigned to an approver , the approver can perform one of the following actions : approve , reject , delegate , or request change .
When an approver rejects a document , the workflow process ends .
For example , Sam has submitted an expense report for USD 12,000 , and this document is assigned to Sue . If Sue rejects the expense report , the workflow process ends .
For example , Sam has submitted an expense report for USD 12,000 , and this document is assigned to Frank . Frank delegates the expense report to Ann .
For example , Sam has submitted an expense report for USD 12,000 , and this document is assigned to Sue . If Sue requests a change , the expense report is sent back to Sam .
Sam can resubmit the expense report . He can make the requested changes first , or he can resubmit the original version of the expense report . If Sam resubmits the expense report , it &apos;s sent to Frank for approval , because Frank is the first approver in the approval process .

title : SEPA direct debit overview
# SEPA direct debit overview
There are two schemes available : the SEPA Core Direct Debit Scheme and the SEPA Business to Business ( B2B ) Direct Debit Scheme . Both schemes use the same file format .
- Mandates expire 36 months after the last initiated collection .
- The scheme may be used for single ( one-time ) or recurring direct debit collections .
- The SEPA B2B Direct Debit Scheme is not allowed when the customer is a private individual ( consumer ) .
Yes . You can use the COR1 scheme for SEPA direct debit mandates in Austria , Belgium , Germany , France , Italy , Spain , and the Netherlands . The scheme provides a shorter pre-notification period for the direct debit collection for the creditor .
# # Where do I enter creditor identifiers ( Direct debit IDs ) ?
# # What are mandates ?
The SEPA data formats are based on the ISO 20022 message standards . You will check the Generic electronic reporting checkbox and select the SEPA Direct debit format as an export format configuration when you configure accounts receivable methods of payment . You use that method of payment when you generate a payment file in a customer payment journal .
- SEPA direct debit payment files in the PAIN.008.001.02 XML file format for Belgium , Germany , Spain , France , Italy , and the Netherlands .
# # How do refunds and returns work with SEPA direct debits ?
Under both SEPA Direct Debit schemes , customers have certain rights to refunds . The customer is allowed to recall any authorized transactions during an eight-week period after the due date , without having to give a reason . In the case of unauthorized transactions , the period is extended to 13 months after the due date . Reversals of any payments that have been made are accomplished manually by using the Cancel payment button in the Customer transactions page .

&#124; Weighted average date &#124; Monthly average cost &#124;
&#124; Invoiced inventory transactions are calculated and settled before the closing date . For example , if you are closing inventory on October 31 , 2016 , and there are open transactions for September and October , all open issued transactions for September and October will be settled together , and adjusted to the same average cost . &#124; Invoiced inventory transactions are calculated and settled monthly . For example , if you are closing inventory on October 31 , 2016 , and there are open transactions for September and October , the September transactions are calculated and settled first , and are adjusted to the average cost for September . Then , the October transactions are calculated and settled , and are adjusted to the average cost for October . &#124;
&gt; Monthly average cost = ( The beginning inventory value for the month + The increased inventory value ) / ( The beginning quantity + The increased quantity )

# # # Excluded products or categories
# # # Global and released products
Assortments are defined at a global level and can contain channels from multiple legal entities . The products and categories that are included in assortments are also shared across legal entities . However , a product must be released before it can actually be sold , ordered , counted , or received in the channel ( for example , in the point of sale \ &#91; POS \ &#93; ) . Therefore , although two stores in different legal entities can share an assortment that contains the same products , the products are available only if they have been released to those legal entities .

title : One voucher
# # What is One voucher ?
The existing functionality for financial journals ( the general journal , fixed asset journal , vendor payment journal , and so on ) lets you enter multiple subledger transactions ( customer , vendor , fixed assets , project , and bank ) in the context of a single voucher . Microsoft refers to this functionality as * One voucher * . You can create a single voucher by using one of the following methods :
# # Issues with One voucher
For example , you post the following multiline voucher .
# # The future of One voucher
# # Why use One voucher ?
# # # Scenarios that require One voucher
# # # Mechanism to group transactions from a business event
* * Scenario * * An organization has a single business event that triggers multiple transactions . However , the Accounting department wants to view the accounting entries together for better auditability .
If the Reimbursement periodic task is run from the Accounts receivable module , it creates a transaction to move the balance from a customer to a vendor . For this scenario , One voucher must be used to reimburse the customer .
# # # Fixed asset maintenance : Catch-up depreciation , split asset , calculate depreciation on disposal
- An additional acquisition is made on an asset , and &quot; catch-up &quot; depreciation is calculated .
- An asset is split .
- An asset &apos;s service date is before the acquisition date . Therefore , a depreciation adjustment is posted .
# # # Bills of exchange and promissory notes
# # Scenarios that don &apos;t require One voucher
The following scenarios can be accomplished through other means and should not use the One voucher functionality .
Summarization of customer payments is supported through the deposit functionality when &quot; bridging &quot; isn &apos;t used on the method of payment .
# # # Post in summary to the general ledger
- Because the transaction details currently can &apos;t be maintained , we recommend that organization * * not * * use One voucher to post in summary form .
# # # Import bank statement transactions
# # # Enter beginning balances
# # # &quot; The system allows it &quot;
Organizations often use the One voucher functionality merely because the system lets them use it , without understanding the implications .

title : Accounts payable invoice matching
# Accounts payable invoice matching
For example , you enter a purchase order with one line item for 1,000 batteries at a price of 1.00 each . The purchase order is approved and submitted to the vendor . The vendor ships 1,000 batteries , and you enter a product receipt for 1,000 batteries at a price of 1.00 each . The inventory cost for the batteries is updated with this price .
An invoice arrives for 1,000 batteries at a price of 1.10 each . Your legal entity policy allows a 5 percent net unit price tolerance for this category of item . A price of 1.05 would be acceptable , but 1.10 is not . When you enter the invoice information , a price matching discrepancy is identified and you can save the invoice until the discrepancy is resolved .
- Two-way matching – Match the price information on the invoice to the price information on the purchase order .
&gt; Other forms of invoice validation can be done using vendor invoice policies .
Typically , invoice matching calculations are automatically performed when you edit vendor invoices on the Vendor invoice page . Alternatively , invoice matching can be performed on demand , as needed . Invoice matching on demand is controlled for the legal entity by the Automatically update invoice header status To on the Accounts payable parameters page on the Invoice validation tab . Invoice matching can also be performed as part of an invoice review process . You can view the results of invoice matching on the Vendor invoice page and related invoice matching pages .

Two-way matching is controlled for the legal entity by the Line matching policy field on the Accounts payable parameters page . Depending on the selection in the Allow matching policy override field , you can select two-way matching for a specific vendor , item , or item and vendor combination on the Matching policy page , and for a specific purchase order on the Purchase order page .
Price totals matching is controlled for the legal entity by the Match price totals field on the Accounts payable parameters page . The purchase price total tolerance percentage and tolerance amount ( not-to-exceed amount ) are also specified on that page .
# # Two-way , net unit price matching

title : Acquire assets through procurement
# Acquire assets through procurement
You can set up the capitalization threshold in the Fixed asset groups page .
In this scenario , the system is set up as follows :
- Accounts are specified in the Account type field for the Fixed asset receipt and Fixed asset issue account types in the Item groups page .
- The capitalization threshold for the computers group ( COMP ) is 1,500 .
To begin , you use the Purchase order page to enter details for the laptop , which costs 1,600 . You select the New fixed asset ? option on the Fixed assets FastTab of the purchase order lines , select COMP as the fixed asset group , and save the purchase order .
When the laptop is received , a shipping clerk enters and posts a product receipt to record the receipt of the laptop . The laptop asset is created and has a status of Not yet acquired . The amount exceeds the capitalization threshold . Therefore , the Depreciation option is selected in the books for the laptop asset . The following transactions occurred .
&#124; Description &#124; Account &#124; Debit &#124; Credit &#124;
&#124; Purchase , Product receipt purchase &#124; Uninvoiced receipts &#124; 1,600.00 &#124; &#124;
&#124; Purchase , Product receipt purchase offset &#124; Accrued purchases &#124; &#124; 1,600.00 &#124;
&#124; Purchase , Product receipt purchase offset &#124; Accrued purchases &#124; 1,600.00 &#124; &#124;
&#124; Vendor balance &#124; Accounts payable &#124; &#124; 1,600.00 &#124;
&#124; Purchase , Product receipt purchase &#124; Uninvoiced receipts &#124; &#124; 1,600.00 &#124;
Finally , the accountant reviews all fixed assets that have a status of Not yet acquired . Therefore , the new laptop asset is reviewed . The accountant then opens the Acquisition proposal page from the Fixed assets journal lines , and creates acquisition transactions for all assets that have an invoice but that still have a status of Not yet acquired . When the journal is posted , the status of the laptop asset is changed to Open . The Fixed asset issue account is credited and the asset acquisition account is debited .
- If the Create a new fixed asset option is not selected when the product receipt is posted , no asset is created at that time . If you select the Create a new fixed asset option before you post the vendor invoice , the asset is created and has a status of Not yet acquired , or a status of Open if you also post acquisition transactions when vendor invoices are posted .
- If the laptop cost is 1,400 instead of 1,600 , the capitalization threshold is not reached . Therefore , the asset is created and the Depreciation option is cleared .
- If an invoice register is used , you use the Invoice approval journal page after the invoice register is posted to retrieve the voucher , link the purchase order to the vendor invoice , select the Create a new fixed asset option , and then post the vendor invoice . If you are a member of a user group that can create acquisition transactions , the acquisition is created and the asset has a status of Open .

# Project forecasts and budgets
&#124; * * Transaction variables * * &#124; When you enter forecast transactions , you can use every attribute that exists for an actual transaction . This allows for greater detail in the forecast . For example , you can enter details for quantities , workers , items , or line properties . &#124; When you enter budget details , you can use only amounts , categories , and activities . &#124;
&#124; * * Security * * &#124; Forecasting is based on transactions that you enter in the forecast forms and involves no process control mechanism . Any worker who has permissions for a forecast form can revise information without approval . &#124; Budgeting uses the workflow system , which enables change management and lets you keep a history of the revisions . &#124;
&#124; * * Forecast models * * &#124; Because each forecast must be associated with a model , you can create multiple forecast models and also set up submodels . &#124; Project budgeting limits the forecast models that are used for budgeting . Fewer forecast models can help increase consistency in projections . &#124;
&#124; * * Cost overruns * * &#124; You can only allow or disallow the entry of transactions that will cause a cost overrun . &#124; Project budgeting provides additional control options for users . You can allow warnings and overruns . &#124;
&#124; * * Control * * &#124; Forecast control is performed by using forecast reduction . Actual amounts are subtracted from forecast transaction balances without any audit trail . This can make it more difficult to trace where the actual transactions occurred . &#124; In project budget control , actual amounts are subtracted from amounts in the remaining budget . This allows for a clearer audit trail . &#124;

title : Retail peripherals
Cloud POS is a browser-based version of the Modern POS program that can be accessed in a web browser .
POS peripherals are devices that are explicitly supported for POS functions . These peripherals are typically divided into specific classes . For more information about these classes , see the “ Device classes ” section of this topic .
POS peripherals are typically divided into classes . This section describes and gives an overview of the devices that Modern POS supports .
Signature capture devices can be connected directly to a computer via USB by using OPOS drivers . When signature capture is configured , the customer is prompted to sign on the device . After the signature is provided , it &apos;s shown to the cashier for acceptance .
Scales can be connected to the computer via USP by using OPOS drivers . When a product that is marked as a “ Weighed ” product is added to a transaction , the POS reads the weight from the scale , adds the product to the transaction , and uses the quantity that the scale provided .
Personal identification number ( PIN ) pads are supported through OPOS , but they must be managed via a payment connector .
- When Windows drivers are used , images are rendered before printing occurs . Therefore , printing tends to be slower than it is on printers that use OPOS controls .
- Devices that are connected through the printer ( “ daisy-chained ” ) might not work correctly when Windows drivers are used . For example , the cash drawer might not open , or the slip printer might not word as you expect .

# # # OPOS device setup and configuration
For more information about OPOS components , see the &quot; Supported interfaces &quot; section of this document . Typically , OPOS drivers are provided by the device manufacturer . When an OPOS device driver is installed , it adds a key to the Windows registry in one of the following locations :
Within the ServiceOPOS registry location , configured devices are organized according to the OPOS device class . Multiple device drivers are saved .

title : Reduce balance depreciation
To set up reducing balance depreciation , you must also make selections in fields on the General FastTab of the Depreciation profiles page . First , select a year in the Depreciation year field . Depending on the selection , different options appear in the Period frequency field , as explained in the following sections .
Because an asset will never be fully depreciated based on a percentage calculation , you must select the Full depreciation option to fully depreciate an asset .
You can select either Calendar or Fiscal in the Depreciation year field in the Depreciation profiles page . The selection defines the options that are available in the Period frequency field . The default option is Calendar .
The Calendar option updates the depreciation base , which is typically the net book value minus the scrap value , on January 1 of each year . In the reducing balance depreciation example later in this topic , the depreciation base is the numerator in the first expression in the calculations column .
If you select Calendar , the following options are available in the Period frequency field , which defines the depreciation accrual posting dates and amounts throughout the calendar year :
- Yearly posts on December 31 .
- Monthly posts a monthly amount at the end of each calendar month .
- Quarterly posts a quarterly amount at the end of each calendar quarter ( March 31 , June 30 , September 30 , and December 31 ) .
- Half-Yearly posts a half-yearly amount at the end of each calendar half-year ( June 30 and December 31 ) .
- Daily posts the depreciation amount for the daily depreciation method using one transaction for each day .
For example , if you select Yearly , the yearly depreciation is posted only one time , on December 31 of each year . If you select Monthly , the monthly depreciation is posted each month as 1 / 12 of the yearly depreciation amount .
If you select Fiscal in the Depreciation year field , the straight line depreciation method is used . It is calculated based on the fiscal year , which is set up in the Fiscal calendars page for the fiscal calendar that is selected in the Ledger page . For example , for fiscal year July 1 through June 30 , the depreciation calculation starts on July 1 . The fiscal year can be longer or shorter than 12 months . The depreciation is adjusted for each fiscal period . The length of the next fiscal year is based on the fiscal periods that you set up when you create a new fiscal year in the Fiscal calendars page .
If you select Fiscal , the following options are available in the Period frequency field :
# # Example of reducing balance depreciation
Suppose that the fixed asset acquisition price is 11,000 , the scrap value is 1,000 , and the depreciation percentage factor is 30 .
Using the Reducing balance method , 30 percent of the depreciation base ( net book value minus scrap value ) is calculated at the end of the previous depreciation period . Depreciation for the first three years is shown in the following table .

# Information used in BOM calculations with standard costs
Bills of material ( BOM ) calculations use data from several sources to calculate the standard costs of a manufactured item . The sources include information about items , bills routings , indirect cost calculation formulas , and the costing version .
- Routing operation time − The time can be specified for runtime and setup time . The hourly time is typically expressed for producing one parent item , but it may be expressed per 100 or per 1000 to handle decimal precision issues .
- Surcharge − A surcharge calculation formula reflects a percentage of value , such as 100 percent , that is tied to a specific cost group , such as labor .
- Rate − A rate calculation formula reflects an amount per unit , such as USD 10.00 per hour , that is tied to a specific cost group , such as labor .
title : Straight line service life depreciation
# Straight line service life depreciation
When you set up a fixed asset depreciation profile and select Straight line service life in the Method field in the Depreciation profiles page , the assets that have this depreciation profile assigned to them are depreciated based on the total service life of the asset . This generally is the same depreciation amount in each depreciation period .
To set up straight line service life depreciation , you must also select options in the Depreciation year and Period frequency fields in the Depreciation profiles page .
If you select Calendar , a year of January 1 to December 31 is assumed , even if you have defined the fiscal calendar differently .
The Calendar option updates the depreciation base , which is typically the net book value minus the salvage value , on January 1 of each year . In the examples later in this topic , the depreciation base is the numerator in the first expression in the calculations column .
- Yearly posts an amount on December 31 .
- Half-Yearly posts a half-yearly amount at the end of each calendar half year ( June 30 and December 31 ) .
For example , for fiscal year July 1 through June 30 , the depreciation calculation starts on July 1 . The fiscal year can be longer or shorter than 12 months . The depreciation automatically is adjusted for each fiscal period . The length of the next fiscal year is based on the fiscal periods that you set up when you create a new fiscal year in the Fiscal calendars form .
You get the same depreciation amount each year . ( Acquisition cost - Salvage value ) / Service life years
Suppose that you add an acquisition adjustment of 4,000 in year 2 to the same fixed asset .

# # Sales tax on transactions
On every transaction ( sales / purchase document lines , journals , and so on ) , you must enter a sales tax group and an item sales tax group to calculate sales tax . Default groups are specified in master data ( for example , customer , vendor , item , and procurement category ) , but you can manually change the groups on a transaction if you must . Both groups contain a list of sales tax codes , and the intersection of the two lists of sales tax codes determines the list of applicable sales tax codes for the transaction .
# # Conditional sales tax
You settle sales taxes each month . On June 15 , you create a customer invoice of 10,000 , plus sales tax .
- The sales tax is 25 percent , or 2,500 .
- The invoice payment is due July 30 .
However , if you are using a conditional sales tax , you settle with the tax authority when you receive the payment from the customer on July 30 .

The ER engine is targeted at business users instead of developers . Because you configure formats instead of code , the processes for creating and adjusting formats for electronic documents are faster and easier .
The ER engine has the following capabilities :
- It becomes the primary standard tool to support localization requirements in electronic reporting , both for Microsoft and for Microsoft partners .
A business entity of a data model is represented as a container ( record ) . Business entity properties are represented as data items ( fields ) . Each data item has a unique name , label , description , and value . The value of each data item can be designed so that it &apos;s recognized as a string , integer , real , date , enumeration , Boolean , and so on . Additionally , it can be another record or records list .
- Company \ &gt; Vendor \ &gt; Payment transactions of the AP domain
- Customer \ &gt; Company \ &gt; Payment transactions of the AR domain
Note that business entities such as company and payment transactions are designed one time . Different mappings then reuse them .
- It can use different Finance and Operations data types as data sources for a data model . For example , it can use tables , data entities , methods , or enums .
- Creation of reporting output as individual files in various formats , such as text , XML , Microsoft Word document , or worksheet .
- Creation of multiple files separately and encapsulation of those files into zip files .
Versioning is supported for ER components . The following workflow is provided to manage changes in ER components :
- The component can be serialized in XML format and exported as a file in XML format .
An ER configuration is shared for Finance and Operations companies .
# # # Building a data model
Data model content ( labels and descriptions ) can be translated into other languages that Finance and Operations supports . You might want to translate data model content for the following reasons :
# # # Configuring data model mappings for outgoing documents
ER can store a designed data model , together with associated data mappings , as a model configuration of the current Finance and Operations instance . The following illustration shows an example of this type of data model configuration ( the payment model configuration ) .

# What &apos;s new or changed in Dynamics AX 7.0 ( February 2016 )
This article describes features that are either new or changed in Microsoft Dynamics AX 7.0 . This version contains both platform and application features and was released in February 2016 .
&lt; td &gt; Cost management is introduced as a domain area . Cost-related configuration and insight were scattered throughout Inventory management , Production control , and Accounts Payable . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; The posting types that are related to inventory accounting and production accounting have been updated . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; li &gt; Push costs and standard sales prices from headquarters to one or more sales companies in one operation . &lt; / li &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Get a quick overview of the inventory balance and average unit cost of a cost object . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; It removes some of the complexity and makes it easier to be a cost controller . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; It can be complicated to perform inventory control on registered inventory transactions and related settlements , because the same transactions can be physical or financial . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; The &lt; strong &gt; Cost entries &lt; / strong &gt; page offers a new way to view inventory transactions .
&lt; li &gt; Transactions are shown in a chronological order . &lt; / li &gt;
&lt; li &gt; Only transactions that contribute to costs are included . &lt; / li &gt;
&lt; li &gt; There is no notion of physical costs or financial cost . &lt; / li &gt;
&lt; li &gt; There is no notion of physical quantity or financial quantity . &lt; / li &gt;
&lt; li &gt; The costs are added incrementally . &lt; / li &gt;
&lt; td &gt; It can save cost controllers a significant amount of time when they must perform inventory control at the transaction level . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; It can save cost controllers a significant amount of time when they need to know what the current WIP balance is on a specific production order , or how much material has been consumed on the order . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Use the View cost comparison feature that has been introduced on production orders . The feature makes it easier to compare costs that are related to a production order . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; The user can compare only estimated costs and realized costs . The comparison can be done at the lowest level . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; The cost comparison feature lets cost controllers compare the following data :
&lt; li &gt; Active cost versus Estimated cost = Planning variance &lt; / li &gt;
&lt; li &gt; Estimated cost versus Realized cost = Production variance &lt; / li &gt;
&lt; li &gt; Planning variance + Production variance = Total variance &lt; / li &gt;
&lt; td &gt; It lets cost controllers or production managers analyze where the production variances come from , and what causes them . &lt; / td &gt;
&#124; Customize with overlayering and extensions . &#124; Extensions aren &apos;t available . &#124; The current version of Dynamics AX has a new customization model . &#124; You can customize source code and metadata of model elements that are shipped by Microsoft or third-party Microsoft partners . &#124;
&lt; td &gt; Export account structures to Microsoft Excel . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Not available &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; You can now select an account structure and export it to Excel . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Many customers have requested the ability to export account structures to Excel for easier filtering . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; View ledgers and advanced rule structures that are associated with an account structure on a single page . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; The user must navigate to multiple forms to see the ledger and the account structure that are used . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; FactBoxes have been added to the account structure page . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; View ledgers that are associated with a chart of accounts on a single page . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; The user sees both types of transactions in a single column . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Add additional posting layers . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Adding additional posting layers was a developer experience . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Ten posting layers are now available . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Most customers add additional posting layers . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Use the Related voucher option . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; When posting intercompany transactions , users had no visibility or tracing to the voucher that was posted in the offset company . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Mass financial period close &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Users are able to update the module access and change the period status for multiple companies at one time . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Prior to the feature , users had to change what company they were logged in , navigate to the ledger calendar form and manually update the module access and period status . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Have exchange rates powered by Oanda . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Configuring the exchange rate provider to import rates from Oanda was a developer experience . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; If users have a key for Oanda they can enter it when configuring the exchange rate provider . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Users can take advantage of out-of-the box functionality by having exchange rates powered by Oanda imported in on a scheduled basis . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; All filtering of Management Reporter reports is handled through the design of the report . For example , if a user who has viewing privileges wants to view a report for a different date , a report designer must make the modification . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Report options have been added , so that different filters can be applied when a user is viewing a report . A new report is then generated based on those filters . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Consumers of financial reports can apply different filters for dimensions , dates , attributes , and scenarios without requiring updates to report designs . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; A separate web client was used to view Management Reporter reports . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; All financial reports can be accessed in the Dynamics AX client . The user selects a report to view , and the report is displayed in the client . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; You can now view financial reports without having to access a different client / application . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Printed reports print in the way users expect instead of printing a web page . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; In three to four clicks , organizations can deploy a Power BI dashboard that contains important financial data . Content can be personalized by the organization . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Track financial period closing processes . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; This workspace eliminates manual systems to define , schedule , and communicate close activities . Therefore , the number of days to close is reduced . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Create layouts for budget plans and forecasts . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; It eliminates the need to print two separate but related reports . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Generate regulatory reports directly in PDF format . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; You must first generate a regulatory report in one format and then export it to PDF format . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; The PDF format is the default format for regulatory reports . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; It provides a unified display experience on both the computer monitor and a printed paper copy . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Run the sales tax settlement process as a batch process . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Access the client anytime , anywhere . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; The two AX 2012 clients have been replaced by a single , standards-based web client that provides the full set of functionality of the desktop client together with the reach of the Enterprise Portal client . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; It prevents development efforts from being split between two UI platforms . By using standard web interfaces , it eliminates the need for Terminal Server . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Be productive by using the new Task recorder . &lt; / td &gt;

&lt; td &gt; Make forms responsive to browser viewport or device size . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Form content needs to be more responsive to optimally utilize the available height / width of the browser or device . Achieving responsiveness may require changes in the way a form is modeled . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Form templates were available as starting points for form development in AX 2012 based on a form style . The Form Style Checker , an optional add-in , provided information on how a form deviated from its corresponding template . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Forms that adhere to patterns have many benefits including a more consistent user interface , a simpler development experience , easier form upgrade path , and increased confidence in form layout responsiveness . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Task guides provide a guided , interactive experience that leads you through the steps of a task or business process . You can download and customize the task guides that Microsoft provides . The topic provides a faster and more flexible way to create , deliver , and update product documentation .

&lt; td &gt; It provides a simple , streamlined process for updating employee records through the compensation workspace and related pages . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Changes in the configuration of sales tax codes are required before users can generate these reports correctly . A conditional sales tax feature is required , and the user must configure separate settlement periods , unrealized and realized , to identify the transactions in the related section areas . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Important declaration information is centrally stored in a single document for better maintenance . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Document compliance and ease of management help reduce issues during audits and other reviews . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; It helps reduce interruptions to users during payment file generation because of invalid characters . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; It provides more flexibility to match local practices . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; On the value models of a fixed asset , you can choose to summarize by major type . By default , this functionality is used for newly created fixed assets . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; For large corporations that have thousands of fixed assets , the summarized reports greatly reduce the size of the report that is generated . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; The consumption tax report is available for a tax rate of 5 percent . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; The consumption tax report contains a section for the revised tax rate ( for example , 8 percent ) . &lt; / td &gt;

&lt; td &gt; All those reports are implemented and SSRS reports . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; This unifies and simplifies the configuration of the Intrastat reporting . Adjustment of rounding settings no longer requires development efforts . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Intrastat commodity codes is a separate list . While there is category hierarchy of type Commodity code , these commodity codes could be defaulted in Retail HQent and sales categories . &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Separate list of Intrastat commodity codes are merged with product hierarchy of type Commodity code . &lt; / td &gt;

Retrieves the `bool` value of a Boolean value .
# # Return Value
The code `JsNoError` if the operation succeeded , a failure code otherwise .
# # See Also
# Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2ScriptDialogOpeningEventArgs class
Assembly : Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.dll
Event args for the ScriptDialogOpening event .
The second parameter passed to the JavaScript prompt dialog .
The kind of JavaScript dialog box .
Accept , confirm , prompt , or beforeunload .
&gt; public string &#91; Message &#93; ( # message )
From JavaScript this is the first parameter passed to alert , confirm , and prompt and is empty for beforeunload .
The return value from the JavaScript prompt function if Accept is called .
This is ignored for dialog kinds other than prompt . If Accept is not called this value is ignored and false is returned from prompt .
The host may call this to respond with OK to confirm , prompt , and beforeunload dialogs or not call this method to indicate cancel .
GetDeferral can be called to return a CoreWebView2Deferral object .
This represents the WebView2 Environment .
Asynchronously create a new WebView .
parentWindow is the HWND in which the WebView should be displayed and from which receive input . The WebView will add a child window to the provided window during WebView creation . Z-order and other things impacted by sibling window order will be affected accordingly .
Create a new web resource response object .
The browser version info of the current &#91; ICoreWebView2Environment &#93; ( ) , including channel name if it is not the stable channel .
This matches the format of the GetAvailableCoreWebView2BrowserVersionString API . Channel names are &apos; beta &apos; , &apos; dev &apos; , and &apos; canary &apos; .
Remove an event handler previously added with add _ NewBrowserVersionAvailable .
title : &quot; JsIsRuntimeExecutionDisabled Function &#124; Microsoft Docs &quot;
`true` if execution is disabled , `false` otherwise .
`JsNoError` if the operation succeeded , a failure code otherwise .
Options used to create WebView2 Environment .
A default implementation is provided in WebView2EnvironmentOptions.h .
AdditionalBrowserArguments can be specified to change the behavior of the WebView .
The default language that WebView will run with .
Set the AdditionalBrowserArguments property .
Set the Language property .
Set the TargetCompatibleBrowserVersion .
&gt; The * * Audits * * panel provides links to content hosted on third-party websites . Microsoft is not responsible for and has no control over the content of these sites and any data they might collect .
When creating a WebView2Environment the following environment variables are checked :
If an override environment variable is found then we use the browserExecutableFolder , userDataFolder and additionalBrowserArguments values as replacements for the corresponding values in CreateCoreWebView2EnvironmentWithOptions parameters .
When found with a non-empty value , this indicates that the WebView is being launched under a script debugger . In this case , the WebView will issue a `Page.waitForDebugger` CDP command that will cause script execution inside the WebView to pause on launch , until a debugger issues a corresponding `Runtime.runIfWaitingForDebugger` CDP command to resume execution . Note : There is no registry key equivalent of this environment variable .
Channel names are beta , dev , and canary . If an override exists for the browserExecutableFolder or the channel preference , the override will be used . If there isn &apos;t an override , then the parameter passed to GetAvailableCoreWebView2BrowserVersionString is used .

* * Mixed content * * means that the main origin of a page is secure , but the page requested resources from non-secure origins . Mixed content pages are only partially protected because the HTTP content is accessible to sniffers and vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks .

title : Dev guide - Autoplay policies
- * * Allow * * is the default and will continue to play videos when a tab is first viewed in the foreground , at the site ’ s discretion .
- * * Limit * * will restrict autoplay to only work when videos are muted , so users are never surprised by sound . Once the user clicks anywhere on the page , autoplay is re-enabled , and will continue to be allowed within that domain in that tab .
- * * Block * * will prevent autoplay on all sites until users directly interact with the media content .
# # Global media autoplay settings
# # Per-site media autoplay settings
Users can control autoplay behavior on a per-site basis under the * * Website permissions * * section of the website information pane . This setting can be found by clicking the information icon or lock icon on the left side of the address bar and clicking on “ Media autoplay settings ” to get started .
Per-site settings override the global setting . For example , if a user has their global setting set to “ Allow ” but changes a per-site setting to “ Block ” , autoplay will be blocked for that site .
# # Best Practices for Web Developers
- Evaluate how autoplay may affect users ’ experience on your website and consider using autoplay in a way that minimizes unwanted media playback . If autoplay is a crucial part of your experience , consider using muted content to start and allowing the user to unmute it . For muted content to autoplay , the audio source must be either explicitly muted or not be set . Otherwise the element will not be considered as muted .
- Unless absolutely necessary to do otherwise , use the native browser controls for media playback . This will ensure a consistent experience for users . If you are building custom controls instead , ensure that media controls are always present and that your controls properly react to autoplay suppression .
Autoplay in an ` &lt; iframe &gt; ` will inherit the autoplay permission from the parent page regardless of content origin . In a playlist scenario where each media file is hosted by a separate iframe , the user would only need to initiate playback once for the entire playlist .

title : &quot; Targeting Microsoft Edge vs. Legacy engines in JsRT APIs &quot;
# Targeting Microsoft Edge vs. Legacy engines in JsRT APIs
Windows 10 supports two different JavaScript engines :
When creating an app using the JavaScript Runtime Hosting ( JsRT ) API , you can choose to target either the legacy or the Microsoft Edge engine .
# # Target your preferred version
When creating an app , you can select the version of the JsRT that supports either the Microsoft Edge engine or the legacy engine . You can choose the JsRT version based on the guidelines above . To accommodate these distinctions , the following changes have been made to `JsCreateRuntime` , `JsCreateContext` , and `JsStartDebugging` .
For `JsCreateRuntime` :
* When targeting the legacy engine , the `JsRuntimeVersionEdge` enumeration value is deprecated , and a message will suggest using the `JsRuntimeVersionInternetExplorer11` value instead .
* When targeting the Microsoft Edge engine , the version parameter is omitted from the `JsCreateRuntime` function .
For `JsCreateContext` and `JsStartDebugging` :
* When targeting the legacy engine , the `IDebugApplication` interface is used to supply your own non-remote debugging methods . For debugging purposes , `JsCreateContext` and `JsStartDebugging` functions take `IDebugApplication` as parameter .
The signatures for the preceding APIs in the Microsoft Edge engine are as follows :
# # Compile for your preferred version using Visual C + +
If you want to target the Microsoft Edge engine binaries , you need to define the macro `USE _ EDGEMODE _ JSRT` before including jsrt.h , and instead of linking against jsrt.lib , you should link against chakrart.lib :
# # Compile for your preferred version using .NET
For the legacy engine , use the following code .
For the Microsoft Edge engine , use the following code .
For example , you can &apos;t create a Microsoft Edge engine runtime and then a legacy engine runtime and expect them to run correctly in the same process . This is unsupported and may result in undocumented behavior , such as failure to load the second DLL .
* When targeting the Microsoft Edge engine , your app may unexpectedly acquire new features when the underlying platform is automatically updated .
* It is critical that you do not confuse the declaration of `JsCreateRuntime` , `JsCreateContext` , and `JsStartDebugging` between jscript9.dll and chakra.dll , because it will result in imbalancing the stack .
When using C and C + + , you will receive a linker error if you try to use the wrong declaration , as long as you &apos;re not doing something like calling `LoadLibrary` and then `GetProcAddress` . .NET developers may not find this problem as easily , so double-check your code when using this feature .

Event args for the NewWindowRequested event .
The event is fired when content inside webview requested to a open a new window ( through window.open ( ) and so on . )
Gets whether the NewWindowRequestedEvent is handled by host .
IsUserInitiated is true when the new window request was initiated through a user gesture such as clicking an anchor tag with target .
The target uri of the NewWindowRequest .
Sets whether the NewWindowRequestedEvent is handled by host .
Sets a WebView as a result of the NewWindowRequest .
Obtain an &#91; IWebView2Deferral &#93; ( IWebView2Deferral.md ) object and put the event into a deferred state .
You can use the &#91; IWebView2Deferral &#93; ( IWebView2Deferral.md ) object to complete the network request at a later time .

title : Domains - DevTools Protocol Version 0.2
# DevTools Protocol Domains
DOM debugging allows setting breakpoints on particular DOM operations and events . JavaScript execution will stop on these operations as if there was a regular breakpoint set .
Debugger domain exposes JavaScript debugging capabilities . It allows setting and removing breakpoints , stepping through execution , exploring stack traces , etc .
The CoreWebView2Controller owns the CoreWebView2 , and if all references to the CoreWebView2Controller go away , the WebView will be closed .
Add an event handler for the AcceleratorKeyPressed event .
AcceleratorKeyPressed fires when an accelerator key or key combo is pressed or released while the WebView is focused . A key is considered an accelerator if either :
1 . Ctrl or Alt is currently being held , or
1. the pressed key does not map to a character . A few specific keys are never considered accelerators , such as Shift . The Escape key is always considered an accelerator .
Autorepeated key events caused by holding the key down will also fire this event . You can filter these out by checking the event args &apos; KeyEventLParam or PhysicalKeyStatus .
In windowless mode , the event handler is called asynchronously . Further input will not reach the browser until the event handler returns or Handle ( ) is called , but the browser process itself will not be blocked , and outgoing COM calls will work normally .
Add an event handler for the GotFocus event .
GotFocus fires when WebView got focus .
Add an event handler for the LostFocus event .
LostFocus fires when WebView lost focus . In the case where MoveFocusRequested event is fired , the focus is still on WebView when MoveFocusRequested event fires . Lost focus only fires afterwards when app &apos;s code or default action of MoveFocusRequested event set focus away from WebView .
MoveFocusRequested fires when user tries to tab out of the WebView . The WebView &apos;s focus has not changed when this event is fired .
Add an event handler for the ZoomFactorChanged event .
Closes the WebView and cleans up the underlying browser instance .
Cleaning up the browser instance will release the resources powering the WebView . The browser instance will be shut down if there are no other WebViews using it .
After calling Close , all method calls will fail and event handlers will stop firing . Specifically , the WebView will release its references to its event handlers when Close is called .
The webview bounds .
Bounds are relative to the parent HWND . The app has two ways it can position a WebView :
Gets the CoreWebView2 associated with this CoreWebView2Controller .
The IsVisible property determines whether to show or hide the webview .
This API initially returns the window passed into CreateCoreWebView2Controller .
The zoom factor for the WebView .
Move focus into WebView .
This is a notification separate from Bounds that tells WebView its parent ( or any ancestor ) HWND moved .
Set the IsVisible property .
Set the parent window for the WebView .
Set the ZoomFactor property .
Remove an event handler previously added with add _ AcceleratorKeyPressed .
Remove an event handler previously added with add _ GotFocus .
Remove an event handler previously added with add _ LostFocus .
Remove an event handler previously added with add _ MoveFocusRequested .
Remove an event handler previously added with add _ ZoomFactorChanged .
Update Bounds and ZoomFactor properties at the same time .

title : Tracking Prevention in Microsoft Edge ( Chromium )
# Tracking Prevention in Microsoft Edge ( Chromium )
! &#91; Three settings of tracking prevention &#93; &#91; ImageThreeSettingsTrackingPrevention &#93;
To determine if a URL is considered a tracker by the classification system in Microsoft Edge , a series of host names are checked , starting with an exact match and then proceeding to check for partial matches for up to four labels beyond the top-level domain .
&gt; * * Example * * :
&gt; Tested host names :
If any of those host names match with a host name on the &#91; Disconnect &#93; &#91; DisconnectMain &#93; &#91; lists &#93; &#91; GitHubDisconnectMeTrackingProtection &#93; , Microsoft Edge proceeds with evaluating enforcement actions to prevent users from being tracked .
To provide protection from tracking actions on the web , Microsoft Edge takes two enforcement actions against classified trackers :
! &#91; Blocked trackers in the page info flyout &#93; &#91; ImageBlockedTrackersPageInfoFlyout &#93;
# # # Org Relationship Mitigation
&gt; * * Example : * *
# # # Org Engagement Mitigation
# # Current tracking prevention behavior
* Along the top are the categories of trackers as defined by &#91; Disconnect tracking protection list categories &#93; &#91; GitHubDisconnectTrackingProtectionCategories &#93; .
* Along the left side are the three levels of tracking prevention in Microsoft Edge \ ( Basic , Balanced , and Strict \ ) .
* The letter `S` indicates that storage access is blocked .
* The letter `B` indicates that both storage access and resource loads \ ( such as network requests \ ) are blocked .
* A hyphen \ ( `-` \ ) indicates that no block is applied to either storage access or resource loads .

title : Localizing extension packages
This guide walks through how to localize your Microsoft Edge extension so that it &apos;s ready for multiple locales upon release . To fully localize your extension , you &apos;ll need to follow the steps for both Windows and the Microsoft Store .
# # The localization process overview
# # Configuring the AppXManifest
Your extension &apos;s &quot; Supported languages &quot; list in the Microsoft Store is generated based on its AppXManifest values . This list is specified using the `Resource` element .
To specify the list of languages that are supported by your extension , you can add a `Resource` element in the format seen below ( this `Resource` element will show support for English , German , and French in the Microsoft Store ) :
In order to specify localized strings for all publicly visible elements in the AppxManifest , you &apos;ll have to use a resource identifier in the format of `ms-resource : &lt; resource id &gt; ` .
# # Localizing extension resources for Windows and the Microsoft Store
Now that your AppxManifest is configured for multiple languages , there are some key differences you should know between localizing the UI within your extension and localizing your extension for Windows and the Microsoft Store .
The i18n based localization infrastructure that &apos;s defined for JavaScript extensions is only applicable within the Microsoft Edge environment .
While we do support JSON based resources for HTML based Windows apps , the schema for the JSON resources doesn &apos;t match the one defined for JavaScript extensions .
- Resources are specified in .resjson files instead of .json files .
- The locales supported should be specified in the AppXManifest file , with the first locale being the default locale .
- HTML based Windows apps resources use the following schema :
- .resjson files are compiled into .pri files which must be included during AppX package creation .
With a configured AppxManifest in hand and the differences between the i18n and UWP localization frameworks highlighted , you &apos;re ready to create your resource files .
Only one resource string in the manifest is applicable to Microsoft Edge extension packages . The `DisplayName` string is commonly localized in JavaScript extensions , and can be easily mapped to the .resjson files that Windows expects . Assuming that this is the only resource that you would like to localize , here is a sample .resjson file that should be created :
The resource ID in each .resjson file needs to match the ID used in the AppXManifest . Using the example .resjson snippet above , the corresponding AppXManifest entry should be :
# # # Creating the resources file
First you &apos;ll need to create the configuration file . This defines the default qualifiers and platform for the resources . For this example , make the default language English ( US ) and the platform Windows 10 . To do this , create a priconfig.xml file with the following content in the &#91; Root folder &#93; :
Now you can use the configuration file and the MakePRI tool to create the resources.pri file . For this example , the root location for the project will be &#91; Root folder &#93; .
You should now have one resources.pri file in your root folder :
# # Localizing name and description in the Microsoft Store
Once you &apos;ve reserved additional localized names , you can create an updated submission . In the description section you can manage additional languages for your Microsoft Store listing :
Once you &apos;ve selected &quot; Manage additional languages &quot; , you &apos;ll get to select which languages you want to add to your Microsoft Store listing . The new language will show up as &apos; Additional description language &apos; in the &quot; Description &quot; section .
You can click on the individual link in the &quot; Description &quot; section to provide a localized name and description , release notes , and visual assets for each language . The description for the Microsoft Store is not extracted from the AppXManifest . Each localized description needs to be manually entered in the Windows Dev Center :
# # AppxManifest samples
The following example shows an AppxManifest that isn &apos;t localized , and only supports the &quot; en-us &quot; locale .

title : Dynamically Insert NASA Picture Below The Page Body Tag Using Content Scripts
&#91; Completed Extension Package Source for This Part &#93; &#91; ArchiveExtensionGettingStartedPart2 &#93;
In part 2 , you learn to update your pop-up menu to not show the static stars image you had before , but to replace that image with a title and a standard HTML button . That button , when selected , passes that stars image , which is embedded in the Extension , to the content page . That image , is inserted into the active browser tab .
* Injecting JavaScript libraries into Extension
# # Remove the image from the pop-up and replace it with a button
First , update your `popup.html` file with some straight forward markup that displays a title and a button . You program that button shortly , but for now , just include a reference to an empty JavaScript file `popup.js`. Here is update HTML .
After updating your Extension and selecting the Extension launch icon , the have the following pop-up includes a display button .
popup.html display after pressing the Extension icon
# # Creating the pop-up JavaScript to send a message
First , create `popup / popup.js` and add code to send a message to your not-yet-created content script that you must momentarily create and inject into your browser tab . To do that , the following code adds an `onclick` event to your pop-up display button .
In the `onclick` event , what you must do is find the current browser tab \ ( if there is only one open it is that one \ ) . Then , once you find that tab , use the `chrome.tabs.sendmessage` Extension API to send a message to that tab .
# # Making your stars.jpeg available from any browser tab
You are probably wondering why , when you pass the `images / stars.jpeg` must you use the `chrome.extension.getURL` chrome Extension API instead of just passing in the relative URL without the extra prefix like in the previous section . By the way , that extra prefix , returned by `getUrl` with the image attached looks something like the following .
# # Updating your manifest.json for content and web access
The updated `manifest.json` that includes the `content-scripts` and `web _ accessible _ resources` is as follows .
# # Adding jQuery and understanding the associated thread
# # Adding the content script message listener
Here is that `content-scripts \ content.js` file that gets injected into every browser tab page based on your `manifest.json` `content-scripts` section .
Notice that all the above JavaScript does is to register a `listener` using the `chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener` Extension API method . This listener waits for messages like the one you sent from the `popup.js` described earlier with the `chrome.tabs.sendMessage` Extension API method .
The first parameter of the `addListener` method is a function whose first parameter , request , is the details of the message being passed in . Remember , from `popup.js` , when you used the `sendMessage` method , those attributes of the first parameter are `url` and `imageDivId` .
* The second , appends an `img` element right below the `body` of your browser tab that has the `slide-image` class assigned as well as the `imageDivId` as the ID of that image element .
* The third adds a `click` event that covers the entire image allowing the user to select any place on the image and that image is be removed from the page \ ( along with it is event listener \ ) .
Now , when you browse to any page and select your * * Extension * * icon , the pop-up menu is displayed as follows .
You have now created an Extension that successfully sends a message from the Extension icon pop-up , to the dynamically inserted JavaScript running as content on the browser tab . That injected content set the image element to display your static stars jpeg .
The runtime &apos;s current memory usage , in bytes .
Event args for the WebMessageReceived event .

If the message posted is some other kind of JavaScript type this method will fail with E _ INVALIDARG . Use this to communicate via simple strings .
For example the following postMessage calls result in the following WebMessageAsString values :

# Getting started with WebView2 ( developer preview )
# # Step 1 - Create a single window win32 app
Visual Studio may show some errors due to missing WebView2 header file , which should go away once Step 2 is completed .
Now let &apos;s add the WebView2 SDK into the project . For the developer preview , you can install the Win32 SDK via Nuget .
You are all set to use and build against the WebView2 API . Press F5 to build and run the sample app . You should see an app displaying an empty window .
# # Step 3 - Create a single WebView within the parent window
In the callback , let &apos;s also set a few settings , resize the WebView to take 100 % of the parent window , and navigate to Bing .
Press F5 to build and run the app . Now you have a WebView window displaying Bing .
In error cases there may or may not be `SourceChanged` , `ContentLoading` , or `HistoryChanged` event ( s ) depending on whether the navigation is continued to an error page . In case of an HTTP redirect , there will be multiple `NavigationStarting` events in a row .
* * Note that these script injection APIs ( and some other WebView2 APIs ) are asynchronous , you should use callbacks if code is to be executed in a particular order . * *
# # Step 6 - Communication between host and web content
As an example to understand the mechanism , let &apos;s try printing out the document URL in WebView with a little detour ,
1. the host registers a handler to return received message back to the web content
2. the host injects a script to the web content that registers a handler to print message from the host
3. the host injects a script to the web content that posts the URL to the host
4. the host &apos;s handler is triggered and returns the message ( the URL ) to the web content
5. the web content &apos;s handler is triggered and prints the host &apos;s message ( the URL )
Press F5 to build and run the app . It will now show URLs before navigating to pages .
Congratulations , you &apos;ve just built your first WebView2 app !

Raised when content in * * webview * * is trying to open a new window . If the event isn &apos;t cancelled the webview will launch the URI of the new window request in the user &apos;s default browser .
Raised when a page inside the * * webview * * element requests a resource .
Occurs when the * * webview * * shows a warning page for content that was reported as unsafe by SmartScreen Filter .
Raised when there is navigation to an Uniform Resource Identifier ( URI ) that the * * webview * * does not support .
Adds a native Windows Runtime object as a global parameter to the top-level document inside of a * * webview * * .
If a navigate fails or is redirected , the addWebAllowedObject calls for that navigation are ignored . If you want to handle redirects you can subscribe to the MSWebViewNavigationStarting event watch for redirects and call addWebAllowedObject again according to whatever criteria is appropriate for your application . Similarly , once a document navigates away any objects injected via addWebAllowedObject for that document will not carry over to the next document and you &apos;ll need to explicitly call addWebAllowedObject if you want them to carry over .
The name parameter must be a valid JavaScript property name otherwise the call will fail silently . If the name is of a property that already exists on the global object then that property is overwritten if the property is configurable . Non-configurable properties on the global object are not overwritten and the addWebAllowedObject call fails silently . JavaScript properties created via addWebAllowedObject are writable , configurable , and enumerable .

This allows you to indicate which languages your extensions supports in your Microsoft Store listing , and what language your extension &apos;s name appears in Windows .
The tool route for packaging your extension , ManifoldJS will package up your extension in a snap with minimal effort on your end . Provide a few Windows / Microsoft Store assets after filling out some AppXManifest properties and your extension will be packaged in no time .
# # Navigating the canvas
- Rotate the DOM : left click and drag around the canvas space .
- Pan around the DOM : right click and drag in the direction you want the DOM to move .
# # # On-screen controls
- Reset the canvas view to the original view : click the button labeled &quot; Reset camera , &quot; or click on the icon that looks like a sideways refresh button and has &quot; Reset elements in view and re-center camera &quot;
- Refresh the canvas ( e.g. if the browser changed or you switched to a device emulator view ) : click on the button that says &quot; Retake snapshot , &quot; or click on the button that looks like a refresh icon and has &quot; Take new snapshot &quot; as the hover text .
# # Z-index
While the Z-index pane has shared features with the DOM pane , they still have elements that are unique to the pane .
# # # Highlight elements with stacking context
This setting allows you to toggle the z-index tags on and off for the elements in the canvas . The checkbox will be selected by default .
# # # Change the scope of your exploration
The * * Show all elements * * button is the quickest way to display all the DOM &apos;s elements after changing the settings below .
* * Show only elements with stacking context * * removes elements without stacking context and flattens the DOM for easier navigation .
The &quot; Show all parents &quot; checkbox will be checked by default . If you select an element in the canvas pane and click on * * Isolate selected element * * , the canvas will only display the element and its parents .
If you select the &quot; Keep only parents with new stacking context , &quot; and click on * * Isolate selected element * * , the canvas will only display the element and the parents that have a new stacking context .
If you deselect both of the checkboxes and click on * * Isolate selected element * * , the canvas will only display the element you chose in the first place .
# # # Z-index color type
If you want to take more of a general debugging view , rather than the z-index experience , the 3D DOM gives an overall look of the DOM . Since the z-index context is removed , the DOM is stacked more closely and cleanly . This pane has similar functionality , but there are a few nuances .

title : Dev guide - Web Authentication
There are two basic steps to using the Web Authentication API :
# # Register your user
The `create` method takes the following parameters :
# # Authenticate your user
Once the credential is created on the client , the next time the user attempts to log into the site you can offer to sign them in using their Web Authentication credential instead of a password with a call to navigator.credentials. * * get * * .
The `get` method takes the * challenge * as its only required parameter . The challenge is an opaque sequence of bytes that the server will send down to a client to sign with the user &apos;s private key . For example :
# # Implementation notes
- The Web Authentication API is not yet available to UWP apps and PWAs .
- Internet Explorer does not support the Web Authentication API .
With the Web Authentication API in Microsoft Edge , you can authenticate users with the following technologies :
A few things to note when using the Windows Hello authenticator :
- When creating a credential for Windows Hello , you should set `authenticatorAttachment` to `platform` for the best user experience .
- Windows Hello only supports RS256 ( alg -257 ) as its public key algorithm . Be sure to specify this algorithm when creating a credential .
- Windows Hello software authenticator : `6028B017-B1D4-4C02-B4B3-AFCDAFC96BB2`
- Windows Hello VBS software authenticator : `6E96969E-A5CF-4AAD-9B56-305FE6C82795`
- Trusted Platform Module ( TPM ) backed authenticators
- Windows Hello hardware authenticator : `08987058-CADC-4B81-B6E1-30DE50DCBE96`
- Windows Hello VBS hardware authenticator : `9DDD1817-AF5A-4672-A2B9-3E3DD95000A9`
- Microsoft Edge has a complete implementation of the Candidate Recommendation version of the core Web Authentication specification .
- No other extensions are supported .
An HTTP response used with the WebResourceRequested event .
HTTP response content as stream .
Overridden HTTP response headers .
The HTTP response reason phrase .
The HTTP response status code .
Set the ReasonPhrase property .
Set the StatusCode property .
# Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2 class
The process id of the browser process that hosts the WebView .
Returns true if the webview can navigate to a previous page in the navigation history .
The HistoryChanged event will fire if CanGoBack changes value .
Returns true if the webview can navigate to a next page in the navigation history .
Indicates if the WebView contains a fullscreen HTML element .
Notifies when the ContainsFullScreenElement property changes .
This means that an HTML element inside the WebView is entering fullscreen to the size of the WebView or leaving fullscreen . This event is useful when , for example , a video element requests to go fullscreen . The listener of ContainsFullScreenElementChanged can then resize the WebView in response .
ContentLoading fires before any content is loaded , including scripts added with AddScriptToExecuteOnDocumentCreated ContentLoading will not fire if a same page navigation occurs ( such as through fragment navigations or history.pushState navigations ) .
This follows the NavigationStarting and SourceChanged events and precedes the HistoryChanged and NavigationCompleted events .
FrameNavigationCompleted event fires when a child frame has completely loaded ( body.onload has fired ) or loading stopped with error .
FrameNavigationStarting fires when a child frame in the WebView requesting permission to navigate to a different URI .
NavigationCompleted event fires when the WebView has completely loaded ( body.onload has fired ) or loading stopped with error .
NavigationStarting fires when the WebView main frame is requesting permission to navigate to a different URI .
Fires when content inside the WebView requested to open a new window , such as through window.open .
Fires when a WebView process terminated unexpectedly or become unresponsive .
The event fires when a JavaScript dialog ( alert , confirm , or prompt ) will show for the webview .
This event only fires if the CoreWebView2Settings.AreDefaultScriptDialogsEnabled property is set to false . The ScriptDialogOpening event can be used to suppress dialogs or replace default dialogs with custom dialogs .
The URI of the current top level document .
This value potentially changes as a part of the SourceChanged event firing for some cases such as navigating to a different site or fragment navigations . It will remain the same for other types of navigations such as page reloads or history.pushState with the same URL as the current page .
SourceChanged fires when the Source property changes .
SourceChanged fires for navigating to a different site or fragment navigations . It will not fires for other types of navigations such as page reloads or history.pushState with the same URL as the current page . SourceChanged fires before ContentLoading for navigation to a new document . Add an event handler for the SourceChanged event .
This event fires when the IsWebMessageEnabled setting is set and the top level document of the webview calls `window.chrome.webview.postMessage` .
Fires when the WebView is performing an HTTP request to a matching URL and resource context filter that was added with AddWebResourceRequestedFilter .
Fires when content inside the WebView requested to close the window , such as after window.close is called .
The app should close the WebView and related app window if that makes sense to the app .
Host object proxies are JavaScript Proxy objects that intercept all property get , property set , and method invocations . Properties or methods that are a part of the Function or Object prototype are run locally . Additionally any property or method in the array `chrome.webview.hostObjects.options.forceLocalProperties` will also be run locally . This defaults to including optional methods that have meaning in JavaScript like `toJSON` and `Symbol.toPrimitive`. You can add more to this array as required .
Setting a property on an asynchronous host object proxy works slightly differently . The set returns immediately and the return value is the value that will be set . This is a requirement of the JavaScript Proxy object . If you need to asynchronously wait for the property set to complete , use the setHostProperty method which returns a promise as described above . Synchronous object property set property synchronously blocks until the property is set .
Adds a URI and resource context filter to the WebResourceRequested event .
URI parameter can be a wildcard string ( &apos; &apos; : zero or more , &apos; ? &apos; : exactly one ) . nullptr is equivalent to L &quot; &quot; . See CoreWebView2WebResourceContext enum for description of resource context filters .
Call an asynchronous DevToolsProtocol method .
A JSON string that represents the method &apos;s return object .
Capture an image of what WebView is displaying .
Specify the format of the image with the imageFormat parameter . The resulting image binary data is written to the provided imageStream parameter . When CapturePreview finishes writing to the stream , the Invoke method on the provided handler parameter is called .
Returns a JSON encoded string that represents the result of running the provided JavaScript .
Get a DevTools Protocol event receiver that allows you to subscribe to a DevTools Protocol event .
Navigates the WebView to the previous page in the navigation history .
Navigates the WebView to the next page in the navigation history .
See the navigation events for more information . Note that this starts a navigation and the corresponding NavigationStarting event will fire sometime after this Navigate call completes .
Initiates a navigation to htmlContent as source HTML of a new document .
The htmlContent parameter may not be larger than 2 MB of characters . The origin of the new page will be about : blank .
Opens the DevTools window for the current document in the WebView .
Does nothing if called when the DevTools window is already open .
Post the specified webMessage to the top level document in this WebView .
The top level document &apos;s window.chrome.webview &apos;s message event fires . JavaScript in that document may subscribe and unsubscribe to the event via the following :
This is a helper for posting a message that is a simple string rather than a JSON string representation of a JavaScript object .
This behaves in exactly the same manner as PostWebMessageAsJson but the `window.chrome.webview` message event arg &apos;s data property will be a string with the same value as webMessageAsString . Use this instead of PostWebMessageAsJson if you want to communicate via simple strings rather than JSON objects .
This is similar to navigating to the URI of current top level document including all navigation events firing and respecting any entries in the HTTP cache . But , the back / forward history will not be modified .
Remove the host object specified by the name so that it is no longer accessible from JavaScript code in the WebView .
Remove the corresponding JavaScript added via AddScriptToExecuteOnDocumentCreated with the specified script id .
Removes a matching WebResource filter that was previously added for the WebResourceRequested event .

title : Memory Terminology
The terms and notions described here refer to the &#91; Memory panel &#93; &#91; DevtoolsMemoryProblemsHeapSnapshots &#93; . If you have ever worked with either the Java , .NET , or some other memory profiler , then this may be a refresher .
# # Object sizes
Think of memory as a graph with primitive types \ ( like numbers and strings \ ) and objects \ ( associative arrays \ ) . It might visually be represented as a graph with a number of interconnected points as follows :
&gt; ! &#91; Visual representation of memory &#93; &#91; ImageThinkGraph &#93;
* Directly by the object .
&gt; ! &#91; Shallow and Retained Size &#93; &#91; ImageShallowRetained &#93;
There are lots of internal GC roots , most of which are not interesting for the users . From the applications standpoint there are following kinds of roots .
* Window global object \ ( in each iframe \ ) . There is a distance field in the heap snapshots which is the number of property references on the shortest retaining path from the window .
* Document DOM tree consisting of all native DOM nodes reachable by traversing the document . Not all of the nodes may have JS wrappers but if a node has a wrapper , it is alive while the document is alive .
The memory graph starts with a root , which may be the `window` object of the browser or the `Global` object of a Node.js module . You do not control how this root object is garbage collected ( GCd ) .
&gt; You are not able to control how the root object is garbage collected \ ( GCd \ ) .
&gt; ! &#91; You are not able to control how the root object is garbage collected ( GCd ) . &#93; &#91; ImageDontControl &#93;
Whatever is not reachable from the root gets garbage collected \ ( GCd \ ) .

&gt; ! &#91; Animated dominator illustration &#93; &#91; ImageDominators &#93;
* Booleans \ ( `true` or `false` \ )
Primitives are not able to reference other values and are always leafs or terminating nodes .
* * Numbers * * are able to be stored as either :
* * Strings * * are able to be stored in either :
A typical JavaScript object is stored as only one of two * * array * * types :
Each wrapper object holds a reference to the corresponding native object , for redirecting commands to it . In turn , an object group holds wrapper objects . However , this does not create an uncollectable cycle , as Garbage Collector \ ( GC \ ) is smart enough to release object groups whose wrappers are no longer referenced . But forgetting to release a single wrapper holds the whole group and associated wrappers .

# DevTools For Beginners : Get Started with CSS
In this tutorial , you learn how to use CSS to style a web page . You also learn how to use Microsoft Edge DevTools to experiment with CSS changes .
&gt; ! &#91; What your site currently looks like &#93; &#91; ImageCssIntro1 &#93;
After completing the tutorial , it will look like this :
&gt; ! &#91; What your site will look like at the end of the tutorial &#93; &#91; ImageCssIntro2 &#93;
By the end of this tutorial , you will understand :
* How to use CSS to style a web page .
* How to use Microsoft Edge DevTools to experiment with CSS .
* The difference between CSS and CSS frameworks .
Before attempting this tutorial , complete the following prerequisites :
* Complete &#91; Get Started with HTML and the DOM &#93; &#91; DevToolsBeginnersHtml &#93; or make sure that you have an understanding of HTML and the DOM similar to what &apos;s taught in that tutorial .
# # Set up your code

* * CSS * * is a computer language that determines the layout and styling of web pages . For example , here is a paragraph with a border :
&gt; This has been styled with CSS
&gt; ! &#91; This has been styled with CSS &#93; &#91; ImageCssStyled &#93;
Here is the HTML and CSS code used to create that paragraph :
# # Add inline styles
1 . Go back to the editing tab and open `index.html` .
&gt; The background color behind the Home and Contact links is now blue
&gt; ! &#91; The background color behind the Home and Contact links is now blue &#93; &#91; ImageCssInline2 &#93;

&gt; ! &#91; The Contact page &#93; &#91; ImageCssInternal1 &#93;
&gt; ! &#91; The font of the Home and Contact links has changed &#93; &#91; ImageCssInternal2 &#93;
# # # Understand internal stylesheets
Internal stylesheets apply styles using * * selectors * * . Selectors are patterns that may apply to one or more HTML elements . For example , in the previous code :
# # # Add multiple selectors to a ruleset
A block of CSS code like what you see below is called a * * ruleset * * .
This tells the browser to style ` &lt; h1 &gt; ` elements the same way that it styles elements that match the pattern `li a` .
&gt; The text &apos; Contact Me ! &apos; now has the same font as the Home and Contact links
&gt; ! &#91; The text Contact Me ! now has the same font as the Home and Contact links &#93; &#91; ImageCssMultiple1 &#93;

# Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2Controller class
AcceleratorKeyPressed fires when an accelerator key or key combo is pressed or released while the WebView is focused .
&gt; public Rect &#91; Bounds &#93; ( # bounds )
In the case where MoveFocusRequested event is fired , the focus is still on WebView when MoveFocusRequested event fires . Lost focus only fires afterwards when app &apos;s code or default action of MoveFocusRequested event set focus away from WebView .
MoveFocusRequested fires when user tries to tab out of the WebView .
The WebView &apos;s focus has not changed when this event is fired .
The event fires when the ZoomFactor property of the WebView changes .
The event could fire because the caller modified the ZoomFactor property , or due to the user manually modifying the zoom . When it is modified by the caller via the ZoomFactor property , the internal zoom factor is updated immediately and there will be no ZoomFactorChanged event . WebView associates the last used zoom factor for each site . Therefore , it is possible for the zoom factor to change when navigating to a different page . When the zoom factor changes due to this , the ZoomFactorChanged event fires right after the ContentLoading event .

title : Analyze Runtime Performance
* Do not over-complicate your CSS . Use less CSS and keep your CSS selectors simple .
* Avoid layout as much as possible . Choose CSS that does not trigger layout at all .
JavaScript calculations , especially ones that trigger extensive visual changes , may stall application performance . Do not let badly-timed or long-running JavaScript interfere with user interactions .
The following table describes some common JavaScript problems and potential solutions :
&#124; Problem &#124; Example &#124; Solution &#124;
&#124; Expensive input handlers affecting response or animation . &#124; Touch , parallax scrolling . &#124; Let the browser handle touch and scrolls , or bind the listener as late as possible . See &#91; Expensive Input Handlers in Paul Lewis &apos; runtime performance checklist &#93; &#91; WebPerformanceCalendarRuntimeChecklist &#93; . &#124;
&#124; Garbage-y scripts affecting response or animation . &#124; Garbage collection may happen anywhere . &#124; Write less garbage-y scripts . See &#91; Garbage Collection in Animation in Paul Lewis &apos; runtime performance checklist &#93; &#91; WebPerformanceCalendarRuntimeChecklist &#93; . &#124;
# # # Style : Tools
&gt; ! &#91; Long recalculate style &#93; &#91; ImageLongRecalculateStyle &#93;
To reduce the impact of `Recalculate Style` events :
* Use the &#91; CSS Triggers &#93; &#91; CssTriggers &#93; to learn which CSS properties trigger layout , paint , and composite . These properties have the worst impact on rendering performance .
# # # Style : Problems
&#124; Expensive style calculations affecting response or animation . &#124; Any CSS property that changes the geometry of an element , like the width , height , or position ; the browser checks all other elements and recalculates the layout . &#124; Avoid CSS that triggers layouts &#124;
&#124; Complex selectors affecting response or animation . &#124; Nested selectors force the browser to know everything about all the other elements , including parents and children . &#124; Reference an element in your CSS with just a class . &#124;
# # # Layout : Tools
The * * Performance * * pane identifies when a page causes forced synchronous layouts . These `Layout` events are marked with red bars .
&gt; ! &#91; Forced synchronous layout &#93; &#91; ImageForcedSynchronousLayout &#93;
# # # Layout : Problems
&#124; Layout thrashing affecting response or animation . &#124; A loop that puts the browser into a read-write-read-write cycle , forcing the browser to recalculate layout over and over again . &#124; Automatically batch read-write operations using &#91; FastDom library &#93; &#91; GitHubWilsonpageFastdom &#93; . &#124;
# # # Paint and composite : Tools
Want to know how long painting takes or how often painting occurs ? Check the &#91; Enable advanced paint instrumentation &#93; &#91; DevtoolsChromiumEvaluatePerformanceReferenceEnableadvancedpaintinstrumentation &#93; setting in the * * Performance * * panel and then take a recording . If most of your rendering time is spent painting , you have paint problems .
# # # Paint and composite : Problems
View and edit the currently applied styles , organized by stylesheet . As you make changes to your properties , a colored indicator bar will appear for changed ( yellow ) , added ( green ) , and deleted ( red ) properties .

# # Navigation events
The normal sequence of navigation events is NavigationStarting , SourceChanged , ContentLoading and then NavigationCompleted .
To monitor or cancel navigations inside subframes in the WebView , use FrameNavigationStarting .
# # Process model
# # Threading model
The WebView2 must be created on a UI thread . Specifically a thread with a message pump . All callbacks will occur on that thread and calls into the WebView must be done on that thread . It is not safe to use the WebView from another thread .
When examining the result of an ExecuteScript method call , a WebMessageReceived event , always check the Source of the sender , or any other mechanism of receiving information from an HTML document in a WebView validate the URI of the HTML document is what you expect .
# # String types
String out parameters are LPWSTR null terminated strings . The callee allocates the string using CoTaskMemAlloc . Ownership is transferred to the caller and it is up to the caller to free the memory using CoTaskMemFree .
Add an event handler for the ContentLoading event .
Add an event handler for the FrameNavigationCompleted event .
Add an event handler for the FrameNavigationStarting event .
FrameNavigationStarting fires when a child frame in the WebView requesting permission to navigate to a different URI . This will fire for redirects as well .
Add an event handler for the NavigationCompleted event .
Add an event handler for the NavigationStarting event .
Add an event handler for the PermissionRequested event .
Add an event handler for the ProcessFailed event .
Add an event handler for the ScriptDialogOpening event .
The event fires when a JavaScript dialog ( alert , confirm , or prompt ) will show for the webview . This event only fires if the ICoreWebView2Settings : : AreDefaultScriptDialogsEnabled property is set to false . The ScriptDialogOpening event can be used to suppress dialogs or replace default dialogs with custom dialogs .
Add an event handler for the WebResourceRequested event .
Fires when the WebView is performing an HTTP request to a matching URL and resource context filter that was added with AddWebResourceRequestedFilter . At least one filter must be added for the event to fire .
Add an event handler for the WindowCloseRequested event .
Fires when content inside the WebView requested to close the window , such as after window.close is called . The app should close the WebView and related app window if that makes sense to the app .
JavaScript code in the WebView will be able to access appObject as following and then access attributes and methods of appObject :
For example , suppose you have a COM object with the following interface
We can add an instance of this interface into our JavaScript with `AddHostObjectToScript` . In this case we name it `sample` :
Then in the HTML document we can use this COM object via `chrome.webview.hostObjects.sample` :
The &#91; ICoreWebView2Settings &#93; ( icorewebview2settings.md ) object contains various modifiable settings for the running WebView .
Does nothing if called when the DevTools window is already open

title : Best practices for developing secure WebView2 applications
# Best practices for developing secure WebView2 applications
1 . Treat all web content as insecure
- Validate web messages and host object parameters before consuming them , because web messages and parameters can be malformed ( unintentionally or maliciously ) and cause the app to behave unexpectedly .
2 . Design specific web messages and host object interactions instead of using generic proxies .
- Set `AreHostObjectsAllowed` to `false` , if you don ’ t expect the web content to access host objects .
- Set `IsWebMessageEnabled` to `false` , if you don ’ t expect the web content to post web messages to your native application .
- Set `IsScriptEnabled` to `false` , if you don ’ t expect the web content to run scripts ( for example , when showing static html content ) .
- Set `AreDefaultScriptDialogsEnabled` to `false` , if you don ’ t expect the web content to show `alert` or `prompt` dialog boxes .
4 . Use the `NavigationStarting` and `FrameNavigationStarting` events to update settings based on the origin of the new page as follows :
5 . When navigating to a new document , use the `ContentLoading` event to remove exposed host objects using `RemoveHostObjectFromScript` .

Use the * * Memory * * panel to measure your use of system resources and compare heap snapshots at different states of code execution . With it , you can :
# # Memory usage timeline
# # # Performance.mark ( )
# # Snapshot summary
# # Snapshot details
By default , the child nodes are sorted by the retained size column , with the largest at the top .
Here &apos;s how to interpret the columns in the * Types , Roots * and * Dominators * views :
Column &#124; Description
Identifier ( s ) &#124; Name that best identifies the object . For example , for HTML elements the snapshot details show the ID attribute value , if one is used .
Type &#124; Object type ( for example , * HTMLDivElement * ) .
Size &#124; Object size , not including the size of any referenced objects .
Count &#124; Number of object instances . This value appears only in the Types view .
The * Types , Roots * and * Dominators * views each has its own filter , so the filter isn &apos;t preserved when you switch to another view .
You can use the * * Scope * * dropdown to filter differential info between snapshots :
By default , the * Show non-matching references * filter is applied to the comparison view to indicate object references that don &apos;t match the current Scope filter . You can turn it off from the dropdown menu :
Start / Stop profiling session &#124; `Ctrl` + `E`
Import profiling session &#124; `Ctrl` + `O`
Take heap snapshot &#124; `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `T`
# # Known Issues
# # # An error occurred while starting the profiling session
If you see this error message : * * An error occurred while starting the profiling session * * in the Memory tool , follow these steps for a workaround .
1 . Press `Windows Key` + `R` .
5 . Close the Microsoft Edge Developer Tools and the tab . Open a new tab , navigate to your page , and press `F12` .

# Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2PhysicalKeyStatus struct
The normal sequence of navigation events is NavigationStarting , DocumentStateChanged and then NavigationCompleted .
For subframes inside WebView , the only navigation event fired is the NavigationStarting event which gives host the ability to block subframe navigations .
The &#91; IWebView2Settings &#93; ( IWebView2Settings.md ) object contains various modifiable settings for the running WebView .
This value potentially changes as a part of the DocumentStateChanged event firing for some cases such as navigating to a different site or fragment navigations . It will remain the same for other types of navigations such as page reloads or history.pushState with the same URL as the current page .
Add an event handler for the DocumentStateChanged event .
DocumentStateChanged fires when new content has started loading on the webview &apos;s main frame or if a same page navigation occurs ( such as through fragment navigations or history.pushState navigations ) . This follows the NavigationStarting event and precedes the NavigationCompleted event .
Remove an event handler previously added with add _ DocumentStateChanged .
This API will be deprecated , please use the new add _ WebResourceRequested API .
The event fires when a JavaScript dialog ( alert , confirm , or prompt ) will show for the webview . This event only fires if the IWebView2Settings : : AreDefaultScriptDialogsEnabled property is set to false .
Post the specified webMessage to the top level document in this &#91; IWebView2WebView &#93; ( ) .
Closes the webview and cleans up the underlying browser instance .
Cleaning up the browser instace will release the resources powering the webview . The browser instance will be shut down if there are no other webviews using it .
Close is implicitly called when the WebView loses its final reference and is destructed . But it is best practice to explicitly call Close to avoid any accidental cycle of references between the WebView and the app code . Specifically , if you capture a reference to the WebView in an event handler you will create a reference cycle between the WebView and the event handler . Close will break this cycle by releasing all event handlers . But to avoid this situation it is best practice to both explicitly call Close on the WebView and to not capture a reference to the WebView to ensure the WebView can be cleaned up correctly .
get _ CanGoForward change value with the DocumentStateChanged event .
Navigates the webview to the previous page in the navigation history .
Navigates the webview to the next page in the navigation history .

title : &quot; JsCreateObject Function &#124; Microsoft Docs &quot;
An object implementing the ICoreWebView2ExperimentalCompositionController interface will also implement ICoreWebView2Controller . Callers are expected to use ICoreWebView2Controller for resizing , visibility , focus , and so on , and then use ICoreWebView2ExperimentalCompositionController to connect to a composition tree and provide input meant for the WebView .
Add an event handler for the CursorChanged event .
The event fires when WebView thinks the cursor should be changed . For example , when the mouse cursor is currently the default cursor but is then moved over text , it may try to change to the IBeam cursor .

# # Set up and run your Universal Windows app
Set up your Windows app development environment in Visual Studio .
When you build your app project , &#91; Visual Studio generates an AppxManifest.xml &#93; &#91; UwpSchemasAppxpackageUapmanifestschemaGeneratePackageManifest &#93; file from this metadata , which is used to install and run your app . Whenever you update your `package.appxmanifest` file , be sure to rebuild the project so both are reflected in your `AppxManifest.xml` at runtime .
You are able to also modify the `Display name` and `Description` as you like .
1 . Save this file \ ( or another 512x512 image of your choosing \ ) to your desktop .
You are ready to run and debug your PWA as a Windows 10 app . If you are using a localhost site to step through this guide , make sure it is running . Then ,
Here is how to set up debugging for your PWA \ ( EdgeHTML \ ) .
1 . With your PWA site up and running , launch the DevTools app .
* WinRT features in JavaScript use &#91; different casing conventions &#93; &#91; ScriptingJsinrtUsingWinRTCasingConventions &#93;
* &#91; Events are represented as string identifiers &#93; &#91; ScriptingJsinrtHandlingWinRTEvents &#93; passed to class `addEventListener` / `removeEventListener` methods
* &#91; Asynchronous methods &#93; &#91; ScriptingJsinrtUsingWinRT &#93; use the JavaScript Promise model
&gt; If you need to listen for the &#91; `activated` &#93; &#91; UwpApiWindowsUiWebuiWebapplicationActivated &#93; event for the app , you are able to do this using the following native WinRT API :
&gt; * * Use this * *
&gt; ... as opposed this type of WinJS request used in the samples :
&gt; * * Not this * *
# # # # Set Application Content URI Rules ( ACURs )
There are several ways to specify a URL `Match` in your rules :
* An exact URI
* An exact URI containing a query property
Here are a few examples of ACURs in a `.appxmanifest` file :
URLs defined within the ACURs for your app are able to be granted permission to the Windows Runtime through the `WindowsRuntimeAccess` attribute , which accepts the following values :
* `none` : Default . The specified URL has no platform access .
If your app needs programmatic access to user resources like pictures or music , or to devices like a camera or a microphone , you must include the corresponding &#91; App capability declarations &#93; &#91; WindowsUwpPackagingAppCapabilities &#93; in your app package manifest file . There are three app capability declaration categories :
* &#91; General-use capabilities &#93; &#91; WindowsUwpPackagingAppCapabilitiesGeneralUse &#93; that apply to most common app scenarios .
* &#91; Device capabilities &#93; &#91; WindowsUwpPackagingAppCapabilitiesDevice &#93; that allow your app to access peripheral and internal devices .
* &#91; Special-use capabilities &#93; &#91; WindowsUwpPackagingAppCapabilitiesSpecialRestricted &#93; that support enterprise scenarios and require a Microsoft Store company account . For more info about company accounts , see &#91; Account types , locations , and fees &#93; &#91; WindowsUwpPublishAccountTypesLocationsFees &#93; .
Some capabilities provide apps access to sensitive resources . These resources are considered sensitive because each is able to access the user &apos;s personal data or cost the user money . Privacy settings , managed by the Windows 10 &#91; Settings &#93; &#91; BingResultsWindows10Settings &#93; app , let the user dynamically control access to sensitive resources . Thus , it is important that your app does not assume a sensitive resource is always available . For more info about accessing sensitive resources , see &#91; Guidelines for privacy-aware apps &#93; &#91; WindowsUwpSecurityIndex &#93; .
In this tutorial , only the default Internet \ ( Client \ ) capability is required , so no further action is needed .
# # # Use feature detection to invoke WinRT
Feature detection may be as simple as looking for the `Windows` object \ ( the entrypoint to the &#91; WinRT namespace &#93; &#91; UwpApiIndex &#93; \ ) as below :
However , given that not all Windows APIs are available on all &#91; Windows 10 device types &#93; &#91; UwpExtensionSdkDeviceFamiliesOverview &#93; , it is generally useful to use more specific feature detection to further qualify the namespace of the API request you are sending :
With that background , you are ready to add some WinRT code to implement a custom context menu . If you are using the sample PWA from &#91; Get started with Progressive Web Apps &#93; &#91; PwaGetStarted &#93; :
1 . In Solution Explorer , open the `views \ layout.pug` file and add the following line , right below the `script` reference for your service worker :
1 . Name your file : `site.js` , and copy in the following code :
&#124; Microsoft Edge &#124; Windows 10 app &#124;
Hopefully you now have a solid foundation for progressively enhancing your PWAs on Windows . If you run into questions or anything is unclear , please send a comment !

title : Console Utilities API Reference
# Console Utilities API Reference
The Console Utilities API contains a collection of convenience commands for performing common tasks : selecting and inspecting DOM elements , displaying data in readable format , stopping and starting the profiler , and monitoring DOM events .
&gt; The following commands only work in the Microsoft Edge DevTools Console . The commands do not work if run from your scripts .
# # Recently Evaluated Expression
Figure 1 : ` $ _ ` is the most recently evaluated expression
# # Recently Selected Element Or JavaScript Object
In the following figure , the image shows a different element selected in the same page . The ` $ 0` now refers to the newly selected element , while ` $ 1` returns the previously selected one .
# # Query Selector
Returns the reference to the first DOM element with the specified CSS selector . This method is an alias for the &#91; document.querySelector ( ) &#93; &#91; MDNDocumentQuerySelector &#93; method .
In the following figure , a reference to the first ` &lt; img &gt; ` element in the document is returned .
In the following figure , a reference to the currently selected element is returned and the src property is displayed .
This method also supports a second parameter , startNode , that specifies an &quot; element &quot; or Node from which to search for elements . The default value of the parameter is `document` .
In the following figure , the first `img` element is found after the `title--image` and displays the `src` properly is returned .
# # Query Selector All
Returns an array of elements that match the specified CSS selector . This method is equivalent to calling the &#91; document.querySelectorAll ( ) &#93; &#91; MDNDocumentQuerySelectorAll &#93; method .
&gt; Press `Shift` + `Enter` in the console to start a new line without running the script .
Returns an array of DOM elements that match the specified XPath expression .
In the following code sample and figure , all of the ` &lt; p &gt; ` elements on the page are returned .
Figure 10 : Using an XPath selector
Figure 11 : Using a more complicated XPath selector
Figure 12 : Using an XPath selector with `startNode`
The `copy ( object ) ` method copies a string representation of the specified object to the clipboard .
When you request the specified method , the debugger is invoked and breaks inside the method on the * * Sources * * panel allowing you to step through the code and debug it .
Figure 13 : Breaking inside a method with `debug ( ) `
For more information on breakpoints , see &#91; Pause Your Code With Breakpoints &#93; &#91; DevToolsJavascriptBreakpoints &#93; .
Displays an object-style listing of all of the properties for the specified object . This method is an alias for the &#91; console.dir ( ) &#93; &#91; MDNConsoleDir &#93; method .
In the following code sample and figure , the `document.body` opens in the * * Elements * * panel .
Figure 15 : Inspecting an element with `inspect ( ) `
When passing a method to inspect , the method opens the document in the * * Sources * * panel for you to inspect .
Figure 17 : Multiple listeners
Figure 18 : Expanded view of listener object
Returns an array containing the names of the properties belonging to the specified object . To get the associated values of the same properties , use `values ( ) ` .
For example , suppose your application defined the following object .
Figure 20 : The `monitor ( ) ` method
Figure 21 : Monitoring window resize events
The following defines an array to monitor both `resize` and `scroll` events on the window object .
&#124; Event type &#124; Corresponding mapped events &#124;
&#124; `mouse` &#124; &quot; click &quot; , &quot; dblclick &quot; , &quot; mousedown &quot; , &quot; mousemove &quot; , &quot; mouseout &quot; , &quot; mouseover &quot; , &quot; mouseup &quot; , &quot; mousewheel &quot; &#124;
&#124; `control` &#124; &quot; blur &quot; , &quot; change &quot; , &quot; focus &quot; , &quot; reset &quot; , &quot; resize &quot; , &quot; scroll &quot; , &quot; select &quot; , &quot; submit &quot; , &quot; zoom &quot; &#124;
In the following code sample , the `key` event type corresponding to `key` events on an input text field are currently selected in the * * Elements * * panel .
Figure 22 : Monitoring key events
Profiles may also be nested . In the following code samples and figure the result is the same regardless of the order .
The result appears as a Heap Snapshot in the * * Memory * * panel .
Figure 23 : Grouped profiles
Return an array of objects created with the specified constructor . The scope of `queryObjects ( ) ` is the currently-selected runtime context in the console .
Returns all `Promises` .
Returns all HTML elements .
Returns all objects that were instantiated using `new functionName ( ) ` .
Figure 24 : The result of the `table ( ) ` method
You may also selectively stop monitoring specific events on an object . For example , the following code starts monitoring all `mouse` events on the currently selected element , and then stops monitoring `mousemove` events \ ( perhaps to reduce noise in the console output \ ) .
Many Chakra hosting APIs require an &quot; active &quot; script context , which can be set using `JsSetCurrentContext` . Chakra hosting APIs that require a current context to be set will note that explicitly in their documentation .

The * Console API * provides command-line and programmatic access to the DevTools Console through the global `console` object , allowing you to :
The following are the commands and formatting parameters currently supported by Microsoft Edge . They work similarly on major browsers .
# # Logging custom messages
Message type &#124; &amp; nbsp ; &#124;
Format parameter &#124; &amp; nbsp ;
And here &apos;s how you might add a green highlight effect to a log message with inline CSS ( ` % c` ) :
# # Inspecting objects and elements
Inspectable objects appear in the console in a collapsed tree view with expandable nodes . The console detects whether you are sending a DOM node ( like a div ) or a JavaScript object ( like an event ) and displays them as the detected type automatically .
Command &#124; &amp; nbsp ;
For example , if you open the console on this page and type :
# # Testing and measuring
In addition to the logical expression you supply as the testable assertion , you can add an optional message and formatting parameters as you would use with other &#91; custom console messages &#93; ( # logging-custom-messages ) . For example :
# # # Counting executions in your code
For example , executing the following lines in console :
. . . will result in :
&gt; My Counter : 1
# # # Timing your code
For example , try executing the following lines in console :
For example , running the following code in the console :
. . . will output the following stack traces :
# # Organizing log output
For example , try entering the following commands in the console :
Sometimes its easier to visualize a JavaScript object or array in tabular form , rather than a flat list . For that , you can use the * console.table ( ) * command :
For example , the following object array :
. . . will render as this table in the console :
The caller implements this interface to receive the WebView2Environment created via CreateWebView2Environment .

# # Security codes
Security error codes are in the `SEC7xxx` format , such as `SEC7113` . These errors reflect security conditions that Microsoft Edge enforces , such as mixed content and tracking protection .
&#124; SEC7115 &#124; &quot; : visited and : link styles can only differ by color . Some styles were not applied to : visited . &quot; &#124; More than one attribute , such as font or size , were changed by using the visited and link styles . &#124; Change only the color attribute . &#124;
&#124; SEC7123 &#124; &quot; Request header &#91; header &#93; was not present in the Access-Control-Allow-Headers list . &quot; &#124; A custom header type was included in the request , but the response &apos;s Access-Control-Allow-Headers list didn &apos;t include it . &#124; Make sure the server allows custom headers and specifically allows the one being sent in the request . &#124;
&#124; SEC7124 &#124; &quot; Request method &#91; method &#93; was not present in the Access-Control-Allow-Methods list . &quot; &#124; A request method , such as POST was used in the XMLHttpRequest , but the response returned an Access-Control-Allow-Methods header that didn &apos;t include it . &#124; Make sure the server allows this type of request method and that you &apos;re correctly using `withCredentials` if that method has restricted access . &#124;
&#124; SEC7127 &#124; &quot; Redirect was blocked for CORS request . &quot; &#124; The path to the CORS resource contained a redirect that violated security rules . &#124; Make sure you have the most direct path to the CORS resource in your XMLHttpRequest . &#124;
&#124; SEC7128 &#124; &quot; Multiple Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers are not allowed for CORS response . &quot; &#124; The response header contained multiple Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers . &#124; This is a server-side error . The server should return a single Access-Control-Allow-Origin header . Report this error to the developer in charge of the server-side resource .
&#124; SEC7129 &#124; &quot; Multiple Access-Control-Allow-Credentials headers are not allowed for CORS response . &quot; &#124; The response header contained multiple Access-Control-Allow-Credentials headers . &#124; This is a server-side error . The server should return a single Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header . Report this error to the developer in charge of the server-side resource . &#124;
&#124; SEC7131 &#124; &quot; Security of a sandboxed iframe is potentially compromised by allowing script and same origin access . &quot; &#124; If the content in a sandboxed iframe comes from an untrusted or unsecured source , it could escape the sandbox when script and same origin access are both allowed . &#124; This is an informational warning message and should not affect functionality . We recommended that you avoid combining these permissions unless you &apos;re sure of what will be run in the iframe . &#124;
&#124; SEC7132 &#124; &quot; The certificate protecting this web site uses weak cryptography &quot; &#124; The TLS security certificate used by this website uses weak cryptography &#124; Update the server &apos;s TLS certificate &#124;

# JavaScript Representation of Windows Runtime Types
The following table describes the way JavaScript represents Windows Runtime types .
&#124; Windows Runtime type &#124; JavaScript representation &#124; Description &#124;
&#124; `Double` &#124; `Number` &#124; A Windows Runtime `Double` is a 64-bit floating-point number . `ToNumber` is used to convert a Windows Runtime `Double` to a JavaScript number . If the conversion fails , a marshaling error is returned . &#124;
&#124; `Char16` &#124; `String` &#124; A Windows Runtime `Char16` is a 16-bit Unicode character , represented as a JavaScript string that contains a single character . A JavaScript value is converted to a JavaScript string by `ToString` and then checked to ensure that the string is only a single character long . The single character is then passed as the `Char16` value . If the conversion or length check fails , a marshaling error is returned . &#124;

# # # Add a CSS declaration to an element
* * What workflow should you use ? * * For most scenarios , you probably want to use the inline declaration workflow . Inline declarations have higher specificity than external ones , so the inline workflow ensures that the changes take effect in the element as you would expect . See &#91; Selector Types &#93; &#91; MDNSelectorTypes &#93; for more on specificity .
To add an inline declaration :
1 . Enter a property name and press `Enter` .
&gt; ! &#91; Adding inline declarations &#93; &#91; ImageInlineDeclarations &#93;
# # # # Add a declaration to a style rule
1 . Enter a valid value for that property and press `Enter` .

&gt; ! &#91; Adding a declaration to a style rule &#93; &#91; ImageAddDeclarationExistingRule &#93;
# # # Change a declaration name or value
Double-click the name or value of a declaration to change it . See &#91; Change declaration values with keyboard shortcuts &#93; ( # change-declaration-values-with-keyboard-shortcuts ) for shortcuts for quickly incrementing or decrementing a value by `0.1` , `1` , `10` , or `100` units .
&gt; Changing the value of the `border-bottom-style`
&gt; ! &#91; Changing the value of a declaration &#93; &#91; ImageAddDeclarationExistingRule2 &#93;

The Coverage tab in Microsoft Edge DevTools helps you find unused JavaScript and CSS code . Removing unused code may speed up your page load and save your mobile users cellular data .
&gt; ! &#91; Analyzing code coverage &#93; &#91; ImageExample &#93;
Shipping unused JavaScript or CSS is a common problem in web development . For example , suppose that you want to use &#91; Bootstrap button component &#93; &#91; BootstrapButtons &#93; on your page . To use the button component you need to add a link to the Bootstrap stylesheet in your HTML , like this :
# # Open the Coverage tab
&gt; The * * Coverage * * tab
# # Analyze code coverage
&gt; A code coverage report
&gt; ! &#91; A code coverage report &#93; &#91; ImageExample &#93;
* The * * URL * * column is the URL of the resource that was analyzed .
* The * * Total Bytes * * column is the total size of the resource in bytes .
* The * * Unused Bytes * * column is the number of bytes that were not used .
title : Alternate Method of Distributing Extension
&gt; External installation of Extension via a preferences json file for macOS &lt; ! --and Linux-- &gt; are not supported yet . This feature support will soon be available .
# # Using the Windows registry
First , publish the Extension in the Microsoft Edge Addons , or package a .crx file and make sure that it installs successfully .
The steps to install Extension via registry in windows are :
* Launch the browser and go to `edge : / / extensions` ; you should see the extension listed .
# # Updating and uninstalling
To uninstall your extension \ ( for example , if your software is uninstalled \ ) , remove your preference file \ ( `aaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbcccccccccc.json` \ ) or the metadata from the registry .

Remote object proxies are JavaScript Proxy objects that intercept all property get , property set , and method invocations . Properties or methods that are a part of the Function or Object prototype are run locally . Additionally any property or method in the array `chrome.webview.remoteObjects.options.forceLocalProperties` will also be run locally . This defaults to including optional methods that have meaning in JavaScript like `toJSON` and `Symbol.toPrimitive`. You can add more to this array as required .
Setting a property on an asynchronous remote object proxy works slightly differently . The set returns immediately and the return value is the value that will be set . This is a requirement of the JavaScript Proxy object . If you need to asynchronously wait for the property set to complete , use the setRemote method which returns a promise as described above . Synchronous object property set property synchronously blocks until the property is set .
We can add an instance of this interface into our JavaScript with `AddRemoteObject` . In this case we name it `sample` :
Then in the HTML document we can use this COM object via `chrome.webview.remoteObjects.sample` :

# Get started with remote debugging Android devices
Remote debug live content on an Android device from your Windows or macOS computer . The following tutorial page teaches you how to complete the following actions .
* Set up your Android device for remote debugging , and discover it from your development machine .
* Inspect and debug live content on your Android device from your development machine .
* Screencast content from your Android device onto a DevTools instance on your development machine .
# # Step 1 : Discover your Android device
1 . On your development machine , open Microsoft Edge .
# # # Troubleshooting : DevTools is not detecting the Android device
* If you are using a USB hub , try connecting your Android device directly to your development machine .
* Try unplugging the USB cable between your Android device and development machine , and then re-plugging your USB cable . Complete the task while your Android and development machine screens are unlocked .
* Make sure that your USB cable works . You should be able to inspect files on your Android device from your development machine .
* Disconnecting and then re-connecting the USB cable while DevTools is in focus on your development machine and your Android homescreen is showing .
&gt; You may not see the prompt if your Android or development machine screens are locked .
* Updating the display settings for your Android device and development machine so that each never goes to sleep .
# # Step 2 : Debug content on your Android device from your development machine

# # # More actions : focus , reload , or close a tab
Figure 4 . The buttons for focusing , reloading , or closing a tab
&gt; * * Select Element * * is disabled after the first selection , so you must re-enable it every time you want to use the feature .
# # # Screencast your Android screen to your development machine
* Clicks are translated into taps , firing proper touch events on the device .
* To simulate a pinch gesture , hold `Shift` while dragging .
&gt; * Screencasts negatively affect frame rates . Disable screencasting while measuring scrolls or animations to get a more accurate picture of the performance of your page .
&gt; * If your Android device screen locks , the content of your screencast disappears . Unlock your Android device screen to automatically resume the screencast .

# # Announcements from the Chromium project
The following sections announce additional features available in Microsoft Edge 80 that were contributed to the open source Chromium project .
The Console now supports redeclarations of `let` and `class` statements . The inability to redeclare was a common annoyance for web developers who use the Console to experiment with new JavaScript code .
&gt; Redeclaring a `let` or `class` statement in a script outside of the Console or within a single Console input still causes a `SyntaxError` .
For example , previously , when redeclaring a local variable with `let` , the Console threw an error :
&gt; The Console in Microsoft Edge 79 showing that the let redeclaration fails
&gt; ! &#91; The Console in Microsoft Edge 79 showing that the let redeclaration fails &#93; &#91; ImageConsoleRedeclarationFails &#93;
Now , the Console allows the redeclaration :

# Microsoft.Web.WebView2.WinForms.WebView2 class
Namespace : Microsoft.Web.WebView2.WinForms \
Control to embed WebView2 in WinForms .
ContentLoading dispatches after a navigation begins to a new URI and the content of that URI begins to render .
This is equivalent to the ContentLoading event on the CoreWebView2 . See CoreWebView2.ContentLoading documentation for more information .
You should handle this event if you need to perform one time setup operations on the CoreWebView2 which you want to affect all of its usages ( e.g. adding event handlers , configuring settings , installing document creation scripts , adding host objects ) .
This event doesn &apos;t provide any arguments , and the sender will be the WebView2 control , whose CoreWebView2 property will now be valid ( i.e. non-null ) for the first time .
This is equivalent to the NavigationCompleted event on the CoreWebView2 . See CoreWebView2.NavigationCompleted documentation for more information .
This is equivalent to the NavigationStarting event on the CoreWebView2 . See CoreWebView2.NavigationStarting documentation for more information .
SourceChanged dispatches after the Source property changes .
This may happen during a navigation or if otherwise the script in the page changes the URI of the document . This is equivalent to the SourceChanged event on the CoreWebView2 . See CoreWebView2.SourceChanged documentation for more information .
WebMessageReceived dispatches after web content sends a message to the app host via `chrome.webview.postMessage` .
This is equivalent to the WebMessageReceived event on the CoreWebView2 . See CoreWebView2.WebMessageReceived documentation for more information .
The underlying CoreWebView2 .
Use this property to perform more operations on the WebView2 content than is exposed on the WebView2 . This value is null until it is initialized . You can force the underlying CoreWebView2 to initialize via the InitializeAsync method .
The Source property is the URI of the top level document of the WebView2 .
Setting the Source is equivalent to calling CoreWebView2.Navigate. If the underlying CoreWebView2 is not yet initialized , this property is &quot; about : blank &quot; . If the property is set to a non-absolute URI or null , the property remains unchanged . See CoreWebView2.Navigate documentation for more information .
Returns true if the webview can navigate to a previous page in the navigation history via the GoBack method .
This is equivalent to the CanGoBack property on the CoreWebView2 . If the underlying CoreWebView2 is not yet initialized , this property is false . See CoreWebView2.CanGoBack documentation for more information .
Returns true if the webview can navigate to a next page in the navigation history via the GoForward method .
This is equivalent to the CanGoForward property on the CoreWebView2 . If the underlying CoreWebView2 is not yet initialized , this property is false . See CoreWebView2.CanGoForward documentation for more information .
* `System.InvalidOperationException` Thrown when invoked from non-UI thread .
This is equivalent to the ExecuteScriptAsync method on the CoreWebView2 . If the underlying CoreWebView2 is not yet initialized , this method throws an InvalidOperationException . See CoreWebView2.ExecuteScriptAsync documentation for more information .
This is equivalent to the GoBack method on the CoreWebView2 . If the underlying CoreWebView2 is not yet initialized , this method does nothing . See CoreWebView2.GoBack documentation for more information .
This is equivalent to the GoForward method on the CoreWebView2 . If the underlying CoreWebView2 is not yet initialized , this method does nothing . See CoreWebView2.GoForward documentation for more information .
This is equivalent to the NavigateToString method on the CoreWebView2 . If the underlying CoreWebView2 is not yet initialized , this method throws an InvalidOperationException . See CoreWebView2.NavigateToString documentation for more information .
Reload the top level document of the WebView2 .
This is equivalent to the Reload method on the CoreWebView2 . If the underlying CoreWebView2 is not yet initialized , this method throws an InvalidOperationException . See CoreWebView2.Reload documentation for more information .
Stop any in progress navigation in the WebView2 .
This is equivalent to the Stop method on the CoreWebView2 . If the underlying CoreWebView2 is not yet initialized , this method does nothing . See CoreWebView2.Stop documentation for more information .
Create a new WebView2 WinForms control .

# DevTools in the Windows 10 April 2018 update ( EdgeHTML 17 )
Decoupling the DevTools from the browser provides these UX and architectural advantages :
- The DevTools run in a separate app container sandbox from Microsoft Edge , providing better reliability for both .
- The app provides easy switching between active DevTools instance tabs ( rather than having to switch between open Microsoft Edge tabs )
- We can ship DevTools updates independently from the Windows ( and EdgeHTML ) release cycle .

The base array of the new array . Use `JS _ INVALID _ REFERENCE` if no base array .
The offset in bytes from the start of `baseArray` ( `ArrayBuffer` ) for result typed array to reference . Only applicable when `baseArray` is an `ArrayBuffer` object . Must be 0 otherwise .
The `baseArray` can be an `ArrayBuffer` , another typed array , or a JavaScript `Array` . The returned typed array will use the `baseArray` if it is an `ArrayBuffer` , or otherwise create and use a copy of the underlying source array .

PWAs in the Microsoft Store enjoy a number of advantages :
There are two options for getting your PWA into the Microsoft Store :
Regardless of submission method , once your PWA is accepted to the Microsoft Store you &apos;ll gain access to all the benefits outlined above .
Then , locate your `appxmanifest.xml` file and replace the following values with the ones assigned in the Windows Dev Center dashboard :
# # # Criteria for automatic submission
To be automatically packaged and listed for the Microsoft Store , your PWA will need :
- &#91; X &#93; A non-empty web app manifest file , with at minimum :
- App icon that is at least 512 x 512 pixels
- &#91; X &#93; To be served over a secure connection ( HTTPS )
- &#91; X &#93; Service worker script ( s )
Your PWA can opt out of automatic import to the Microsoft Store by serving a `robots.txt` file containing the following :
If an override environment variable is found then we use the browserExecutableFolder , userDataFolder and additionalBrowserArguments values as replacements for the corresponding values in CreateWebView2EnvironmentWithDetails parameters .
Channel names are beta , dev , and canary . If an override exists for the browserExecutableFolder or the channel preference , the override will be used . If there isn &apos;t an override , then the parameter passed to GetWebView2BrowserVersionInfo is used .

Service Workers are a special type of Web Worker with the ability to intercept , modify , and respond to all network requests using the `Fetch` API . Service Workers can access the `Cache` API , and asynchronous client-side data stores , such as `IndexedDB` , to store resources .
# # Registering a Service Worker
# # The Service Worker lifecycle
1 . Register the Service Worker .
1 . The Service Worker is activated , which triggers the `activate` event . Use this event to clean up outdated caches .
1 . The Service Worker is now running .
# # Using fetch in Service Workers
* If available , return a response from the cache , otherwise fallback to request the resource over the network .

title : &quot; JsGetExternalData Function &#124; Microsoft Docs &quot;
title : &quot; JsSetObjectBeforeCollectCallback Function &#124; Microsoft Docs &quot;
&#124; Type &#124; Description &#124;
&#124; String &#124; Content type of the data . This string should be in the format specified in the media-type token defined in section 3.7 of RFC 2616 .
&#124; Blob &#124; New blob object that contains the stream .
&#124; Exception &#124; Condition &#124;
&#124; Any &#124; Contains the HTML markup for the specified range .
The returned data package for the selection contains HTML markup in clipboard format . If there is no user selection anywhere within the application &apos;s UI , the `createDataPackageFromSelection` returns null .
&#124; Any &#124; Contains the storage file .
This method takes a content-type , and the `IInputStream` reference . The method then verifies that the stream reference passed in is an instance of type `IInputStream` and if not , throws `DOMException TYPE _ MISMATCH _ ERR` . If no error occurs , `createStreamFromInputStream` creates an `MSStream` ( from its inputs ) .
An `IInputStream` can be used to create an `MSStream` . As `MSStreams` are inherently one-time-use objects , all URLs created by `URL.createObjectURL` are revoked the first time it &apos;s resolved by the image element . Additionally , requests for a second URL on this object after the stream has been used will fail .
&#124; Function &#124; The callback function to run asynchronously , dispatched at the given priority priority .
&#124; Any &#124; An optional series of arguments that are passed to the synchronousCallback callback function ( as parameters 1 and on ) .
Unlike `execAtPriority` , any object returned by the `asynchronousCallback` callback function is ignored ( and not returned via `execAsyncAtPriority` ) .
&#124; Any &#124; An optional series of arguments that are passed to the `synchronousCallback` callback function ( as parameters 1 and on ) .
&#124; Any &#124; Returns the return value of the `synchronousCallback` callback ( as applicable ) .
The provided `synchronousCallback` callback method is execute synchronously . The current contextual priority is changed to the provided priority value ( given by the priority argument ) for the duration of the provided callback function . Once the callback function finishes executing , priority is returned to the previous value prior to the `execAtPriority` call . The return value from `execAtPriority` is the return value of the callback method ( as provided ) .
&#124; DOMString &#124; The return value is one of the strings `MSApp.HIGH` , `MSApp.NORMAL` , or `MSApp.IDLE` .
&#124; Document &#124; The HTML document to be printed . This can be the root document , the document in an iframe , a document fragment , or a SVG document . Be aware that htmlDoc must be a document , not an element .
&#124; Description &#124; Windows 10 &#124; Windows 8.1 &#124;
&#124; DOMString &#124; An object representing a window containing a DOM document . &#124;
&#124; window.open &#124; Allowed &#124; Disallowed &#124;
&#124; window.close &#124; Close app &#124; Close window &#124;
&#124; Navigation restrictions &#124; ACUR only &#124; No restrictions &#124;
&#124; Boolean &#124; Returns `true` if there is any queued work at the specified priority level or above , `false` otherwise .
The `isTaskScheduledAtPriorityOrHigher` method provides a means for JavaScript code to determine if there is pending work at the various priority levels ( or above ) with the intent that the calling JavaScript code can then decide to yield to higher priority work .
&#124; Boolean &#124; A value of true suppresses potential authentication prompts . A value of false does not suppress any potential authentication prompts from the user .
`suppressSubdownloadCredentialPrompts` is intended for use by apps which may load an excessive number of resources that require authentication , such as a mail app ( which could contain a newsletter containing a number of images where each image requires authentication ) .
* * Important : * * Credential prompt decisions are cached . Therefore , while suppressing credential prompts will take effect immediately , allowing credential prompts after suppressing them may need a reload of the document to take effect .
Type &#124; Description &#124;
&#124; Error &#124; An `Error` object that you can use to describe the error that triggered the termination . The `Error` object must contain the number , description , and stack properties ; a failure report won &apos;t be generated if the object doesn &apos;t contain these properties .
If the issue reported by `terminateApp` becomes one of your app &apos;s top 5 issues , it will show up on the app &apos;s Quality page .
This example calls `terminateApp` when an exception is encountered . It uses the `Error` object provided when you catch an exception .
Allowed priority values associated with `execAsyncAtPriority` , `execAtPriority` , `getCurrentPriority` , and `isTaskScheduldAtPriorityOrHigher` .
&#124; DOMString &#124; When `current` is used with the appropriate method ( See also section ) , the method will use the current contextual priority when executing the requested operation .
&#124; DOMString &#124; When `high` is used with the appropriate method ( See also section ) , the method will use higher than normal priority when executing the requested operation and will be dispatch the operation before any existing normal priority work .
&#124; DOMString &#124; When `ideal` is used with the appropriate method ( See also section ) , the method will use lower than normal priority when executing the requested operation and will be dispatch the operation after any existing normal priority work .
&#124; DOMString &#124; When `normal` is used with the appropriate method ( See also section ) , the method will use the normal existing priority when executing the requested operation .

# Considerations when Using the Windows Runtime API
# # Special Cases in the JavaScript Representation of Windows Runtime Types
* Interfaces : You cannot implement a Windows Runtime interface in JavaScript .
* Arrays : Windows Runtime arrays are not resizable , so methods that resize arrays in JavaScript do not work on Windows Runtime arrays .
In the following code , two interfaces have a Draw method , and a runtime class implements both interfaces .
Here is how you can call the above code in JavaScript .
The JavaScript version of this signature is :
In this example , `returnValue` is a JavaScript object that has two fields : `first` and `second` .
* Static members : The Windows Runtime defines both static members and instance members . In JavaScript , static members are added to the object that is associated with the Windows Runtime class or interface .

title : Extensions for enterprise
Microsoft Edge extensions have a similar workflow when compared to other enterprise UWP apps . The information below details enterprise specific aspects of Microsoft Edge extensions .
The following items are suggested to develop , package , and deploy a Microsoft Edge extension for enterprise :
# # Packaging Extensions
# # Distributing Extensions
&gt; If the enterprise is both developing and distributing the extension internally , the enterprise will require both the Microsoft Store for Business ( or Education ) and a Windows Developer Portal account .
# # # Behavior of Sideloaded Extensions
The first difference affects how sideloaded extensions behave after installation . Unlike extensions from the Microsoft Store , sideloaded extensions do not immediately display the &quot; You have a new extension &quot; notification and need to be manually turned on by the user .
Each time Microsoft Edge is launched , users will need to select &quot; Turn on anyway &quot; in order to use the extension .

# # The manifest file basics
# # Extension icons setup
`PNG` is the recommended format , but you may also use `BMP` , `GIF` , `ICO` and `JPEG` . It is recommended to always have at least a 128x128 pixels size icon and the browser automatically resizes it as necessary .
Your updated `manifest.json` file should appear as follows .
&gt; The icon `png` files listed previous code are available in the zip download mentioned at the top of this page .
# # Adding a default pop-up dialog
Now , create an `HTML` file that is automatically run when the user selects on the extension icon .
The HTML file is named `popup / popup.html`. Selecting the Extension icon launches `popup / popup.html` as modal dialog that stays up until you select outside the dialog .
For this , register the file as a default pop-up in the `manifest.json` under `browser _ action` in the following code .
In the `popup` directory , add the file `popup.html` and have it render the stars image . Here is the `popup.html` file .
Also , add an image file `images / stars.jpeg` that is referenced in the `popup.html` file .

title : Content Security Policy ( CSP )
# Content Security Policy \ ( CSP \ )
On the web , such a policy is defined via an HTTP header or `meta` element . Inside the Microsoft Edge Extension system , neither is an appropriate mechanism . Instead , an Extension policy is defined via the `manifest.json` file for the Extension as follows :
&gt; For full details regarding the CSP syntax , please take a look at the &#91; Content Security Policy specification &#93; &#91; W3CContentSecurityPolicy &#93; , and the &#91; &quot; An Introduction to Content Security Policy &quot; &#93; &#91; HTML5RocksIntroductionContentSecurityPolicy &#93; article on HTML5Rocks .
# # Default Policy Restrictions
Packages that do not define a `manifest _ version` do not have a default content security policy . Those that select `manifest _ version` 2 , have a default content security policy of :
* * Eval and related functions are disabled * *
Evaluating strings of JavaScript like this is a common XSS attack vector . Instead , you should write code like :
* The `clickHandler` definition must be moved into an external JavaScript file \ ( `popup.js` may be a good target ) .
* The inline event handler definitions must be rewritten in terms of `addEventListener` and extracted into `popup.js` .
* * Only local script and object resources are loaded * *
Instead of writing code that depends on jQuery \ ( or any other library \ ) loading from an external CDN , consider including the specific version of jQuery in your Extension package . That is , instead of :
Download the file , include it in your package , and write :
# # Relaxing the default policy
If you require some external JavaScript or object resources , you may relax the policy to a limited extent by allowlisting secure origins from which scripts should be accepted . Verify that runtime resources loaded with with elevated permissions of an Extension are exactly the resources you expect , and are not replaced by an active network attacker . As &#91; man-in-the-middle attacks &#93; &#91; WikiManMiddleAttacks &#93; are both trivial and undetectable over HTTP , those origins are not accepted .
&gt; Both `script-src` and `object-src` are defined by the policy . Microsoft Edge does not accept a policy that does not limit each of these values to \ ( at least \ ) &apos; `self` &apos; .
However , we strongly recommend against doing this . These functions are notorious XSS attack vectors .
# # Tightening the default policy
# # Content Scripts
This content script causes an `alert` immediately upon the `document.write ( ) ` . Note that this runs regardless of the policy a page may specify .
However , the behavior becomes more complicated both inside that DOM injected script and for any script that does not immediately run upon injection . Imagine that your Extension is running on a page that provides an associated CSP that specifies `script-src &apos; self &apos; ` . Now imagine the content script runs the following code :
If a user clicks on that button , the `onclick` script does not run . This is because the script did not immediately run and code is not interpreted until the click event occurs is not considered part of the content script , so the CSP of the page \ ( not of the Extension \ ) restricts the behavior . And since that CSP does not specify `unsafe-inline` , the inline event handler is blocked .
In this case , the script runs and the alert displays . However , take this case :
While the initial script runs , the call to `eval` is blocked . That is , while the initial script runtime is allowed , the behavior within the script is regulated by the CSP of the page .
Thus , depending on how you write DOM injected scripts in your Extension , changes to the CSP of the page may affect the behavior of your Extension . Since content scripts are not affected by the CSP of the page , this a great reason to put as much behavior as possible of your Extension into the content script rather than DOM injected scripts .

title : &quot; Hosting the JavaScript Runtime &quot;
# Hosting the JavaScript runtime
&gt; This documentation assumes a general working familiarity with the JavaScript language .
Understanding how to host the JavaScript engine using the JsRT APIs depends on two key concepts : runtimes and execution contexts .
# # Memory management
JavaScript is a garbage collected language , and thus there are several considerations that must be kept in mind when working with the JsRT APIs from another language .
&gt; Some language compilers ( such as the Visual Studio C + + compiler ) will optimize away local variables where possible . Care must be taken to ensure that local variables that reference JavaScript values are on the stack if they are expected to keep those values alive .
# # Exception handling
# # Runtime resource usage
# # Debugging and profiling
JsRT APIs supports debugging and profiling via the Active Scripting technology .
To make scripts in an execution context debuggable , the Chakra engine has to switch to using less efficient code execution methods . As such , debuggable code typically runs slower than non-debuggable code . As a result , with the legacy engine , a host can choose to either start debugging in an execution context from the beginning by providing the `IDebugApplication` pointer up front through `JsCreateContext` , or it can wait until debugging is needed and then call `JsStartDebugging` . With the Microsoft Edge engine , `JsCreateContext` no longer takes an `IDebugApplication` parameter , and as a result the script is debuggable only after `JsStartDebugging` is called . When debugging using Visual Studio , the &quot; Script &quot; debugger option must be enabled .

title : Get Started with Remote Debugging Windows 10 Devices
Remote debug live content on a Windows 10 device from your Windows or macOS computer . This tutorial teaches you how to :
* Set up your Windows 10 device for remote debugging and connect to it from your development machine .
* Inspect and debug live content on your Windows 10 device from your development machine .
* Screencast content from your Windows 10 device onto a DevTools instance on your development machine .
# # Step 1 : Set up the host ( debuggee machine )
The host or debuggee machine is the Windows 10 device that you want to debug . It may be a remote device that is hard for you to physically access or it may not have keyboard and mouse peripherals , making it difficult to interact with the Microsoft Edge DevTools on that device . To set up the host ( debuggee ) machine , you will need to :
# # # Activate Developer Mode and enable Device Portal
&gt; Note the IP address and connection port in the * * Settings * *
# # Step 2 : Set up the client ( debugger machine )
&gt; The `edge : / / inspect` page on the client
# # Step 3 : Debug content on the host from the client
For example , try inspecting an element . Go to the * * Elements * * panel of your DevTools instance on the client , and hover over an element to highlight it in the viewport of the host device .
# # Step 4 : Screencast your host screen to your client device
Some notes on screencasts :
* Screencasts negatively affect frame rates . Disable screencasting while measuring scrolls or animations to get a more accurate picture of the performance of your page .
Use the * * Storage * * panel to inspect and manage various locally cached data , including :
Expand any of those categories and click on a child entry to open its resource manager tab .
# # Local and Session storage managers
Use the * Local Storage manager * and * Session Storage manager * to inspect and manage the web storage for your page .
From the * Local Storage * and * Session Storage * tabs you can :
From the * Storage list * table you can :
&#124; Refresh &#124; `Ctrl` + `F5` &#124;
&#124; Delete item &#124; `Del` &#124;
&#124; Copy selected items &#124; `Ctrl` + `C` &#124;
&#124; Select all &#124; `Ctrl` + `A` &#124;
From the * IndexedDB * toolbar you can :
# # # Object store entries list
From the * Object store * or * Index * table you can :
- * * Inspect and sort * * your key-value pairs by clicking on any column name in the table .
Key &#124; Name of the key-value pair ( same as * Primary Key * ) when iterating over an object store ; Name of the index key ( cursor &apos;s current key ) when iterating over an index
Value &#124; Value of the key-value pair
Refresh &#124; `Ctrl` + `F5`
Delete key-value pair &#124; `Del`
Copy selected items &#124; `Ctrl` + `C`
Select all &#124; `Ctrl` + `A`
Use the * Cookies manager * to inspect and manage the cookies for the given domain .
From the * Cookies * tab toolbar you can :
From the * Cookies list * table you can :
- * * Inspect and sort * * your cookies by clicking on any column name in the table .
The columns of the * Cookies list * are sortable :
Name &#124; Name of the cookie
Value &#124; Value of the cookie
Domain &#124; Host name of the cookie ( may be empty )
Path &#124; URL path for the cookie ( may be empty )
Expires &#124; Maximum lifetime of the cookie as an HTTP-date timestamp . If no `Expires` or `Max-Age` was set , the entry is considered a * Session * cookie .
HTTP only &#124; Indicates if the cookie was set with `HttpOnly` directive , indicating that it is inaccessible from JavaScript
Secure &#124; Indicates if the cookie was set with the `Secure` directive , indicating it will only be sent to the server from a request using SSL and the HTTPS protocol .
&#124; Delete cookie &#124; `Del` &#124;
&#124; Delete all session cookies &#124; `Ctrl` + `Del` &#124;
You can debug your extensions in Microsoft Edge by using F12 Developer Tools .
The following video goes through a buggy Microsoft Edge extension , walking though each debugging scenario and fixing it up along the way . See the step-by-step instructions below for more info .
# # Background script debugging
To start debugging the background script of your extension :
2 . Click on the extension that you want to debug .
5 . Navigate to and select your extension &apos;s background script .
6 . Place breakpoints for debugging by clicking to the left of the source code line number .
# # Content script debugging
To start debugging the content script of your extension :
&gt; Only running content scripts will appear .
3 . Place breakpoints for debugging by clicking to the left of the source code line number .
4 . Refresh the browser tab to begin stepping though your code .
# # Extension page debugging
# # # Debugging any extension page
The following method works for all extension pages like the options page and popups :
1 . Right-click on the background of your page .
3 . Once F12 opens , place breakpoints within the file you want to debug .
# # # Debugging a popup extension page
1 . Right-click your extension &apos;s icon .
3 . Follow steps 3 and 4 above for placing breakpoints and reloading the popup .

If set to false , then WebView won &apos;t render the default javascript dialog box ( Specifically those shown by the javascript alert , confirm , and prompt functions ) . Instead , if an event handler is set by SetScriptDialogOpeningEventHandler , WebView will send an event that will contain all of the information for the dialog and allow the host app to show its own custom UI .
This setting is deprecated and will always return false .
That means elements in the WebView will only fill the WebView bounds . This property will then be completely removed . Please listen to the ContainsFullScreenElementChanged event instead .
Controls if fullscreen is allowed for elements in the WebView . When it is allowed , web content such as a video element in the WebView is allowed to be displayed full screen .

* Capture animations by opening the Animation Inspector . The Animation Inspector automatically detects and sorts animations into groups .
* Modify animations by changing the timing , delay , duration , or keyframe offsets .
The Microsoft Edge DevTools Animation Inspector has two main purposes .
* Modifying animations . You want to modify the timing , delay , duration , or keyframe offsets of an Animation Group . Bezier editing and keyframe editing are currently not supported .
The Animation Inspector supports CSS animations , CSS transitions , and web animations . `requestAnimationFrame` animations are currently not supported .

title : Map Preprocessed Code to Source Code
* Use Source Maps to map minified code to source code . You are then able to read and debug compiled code in the original source .
* Verify that your web server is able to serve Source Maps .
# # Get started with preprocessors
# # Use a supported preprocessor
# # Source Maps in DevTools Sources panel
Source Maps from preprocessors cause DevTools to load your original files in addition to your minified ones . You then use the originals to set breakpoints and step through code . Meanwhile , Microsoft Edge is actually running your minified code . This gives you the illusion of running a development site in production .
When running Source Maps in DevTools , you should notice that the JavaScript is not compiled and you are able to see all the individual JavaScript files it references . This is using source mapping , but behind the scenes actually runs the compiled code . Any errors , logs , and breakpoints map to the dev code for awesome debugging ! So in effect it gives you the illusion that you are running a dev site in production .

title : Get started with Progressive Web Apps
# Get started with Progressive Web Apps
This guide gives you an overview of PWA basics by building a simple `localhost` web app as a PWA using Microsoft Visual Studio and some PWA Builder utilities . The finished product works similarly across any browser that supports PWAs .
&gt; For a quick way to convert an existing site to a PWA and package it for Windows 10 and other app platforms , review &#91; PWA Builder &#93; &#91; PwaBuilder &#93; .
You may build PWAs with any web development IDE . The following are only prerequisites for this guide , which walks you through PWA tooling support in the Windows developer ecosystem .
# # Set up a basic web app
1 . Launch Visual Studio , and start a new project .
! &#91; Running your new site on localhost &#93; &#91; ImageVsNodejsExpressIndex &#93;
# # Turn your app into a PWA
1 . In the `manifest.json` file , copy the following code .
To learn more about the different member values and associated purposes , see the &#91; Web App Manifest &#93; &#91; MDNWebAppManifest &#93; reference .
1 . Next , fill in the empty `icons` array with actual image paths by using the PWA Builder App Image Generator .
With all that in place , your web app is now serving up a manifest and homescreen-ready app icons ! Try running your app \ ( `F5` \ ) and loading up the manifest .
! &#91; Web App Manifest loading from localhost &#93; &#91; ImageVsNodejsExpressManifest &#93;
! &#91; Square71x71Logo app logo loading from localhost &#93; &#91; ImageVsNodejsExpressIcon &#93;
* At least one icon 512px square or larger \ ( to ensure an image source of sufficient resolution for auto-generating the splash screen of your app , store listing , tile image , and so on \ ) .
For this tutorial , use the Offline page service worker script on &#91; PWA Builder &#93; &#91; PwaBuilderServiceWorker &#93; . Start by customizing the script with more functionality according to your performance requirements , network bandwidth , and so on . Review the &#91; Service Worker Cookbook &#93; &#91; ServiceWorkerCookbook &#93; provided by Mozilla for a number of useful service worker caching ideas .
1 . In Solution Explorer , open the `views / layout.pug` file , and add the following line below your link tags .
At this point , your `public` folder should have three new files .
! &#91; Files added to the public folder of the solution &#93; &#91; ImageVsNodejsExpressPublic &#93;
# # Add push notifications
The following is adapted from the Push Rich Demo in &#91; Service Worker Cookbook &#93; &#91; ServiceWorkerCookbookPushRichDemo &#93; provided by Mozilla , which is worth checking out for a number of other useful Web Push and service worker recipes .
This installs the &#91; Web-Push &#93; &#91; NPMWebPush &#93; library . Then , open up your `index.js` file , and add the following line to the top of your file after the other requirement statements .
In your `index.js` file , just before the final \ ( `module.exports = router` \ ) line , add the following code .
Copy the `publicKey` and `privateKey` values that you just generated . Feel free to customize the `mailto` address as well \ ( though it is not required in order to run this sample \ ) .
# # # Step 3 - Handle push-related server requests
With the server-side code in place , plumb in push notifications on the PWA client .
In your `pwabuilder-sw-register.js` file , append the following code .
With our push subscription set up , the remainder of the work happens in the service worker . First you must set up a handler for server-sent push events , and respond with a toast notification \ ( if permission was granted \ ) displaying the push data payload . Next you add a click handler for the toast to dismiss the notification and sort through a list of currently open windows to open , focus , or open and focus the intended PWA client page .
In your `pwabuilder-sw.js` file , append the following handlers .
Time to test push notifications in your PWA !
! &#91; Permission dialog for enabling notifications &#93; &#91; ImageNotificationPermission &#93;
! &#91; Push a notification from DevTools &#93; &#91; ImageDevtoolsPush &#93;
! &#91; Push a notification from PWA server &#93; &#91; ImagePwaPush &#93;
If you do not click \ ( or activate \ ) a toast notification , it is dismissed after several seconds and queue up in your Windows Action Center .
! &#91; Notifications in Windows Action Center &#93; &#91; ImageWindowsActionCenter &#93;
You have the basics of PWA push notifications . In a real app , the next steps are implemented in a way to manage and store push subscriptions and to properly &#91; encrypt &#93; &#91; NPMWebPushEncrypt &#93; payload data being sent across the wire .

To run as a PWA , your server-hosted web app at minimum requires :
* &#91; X &#93; &#91; Service workers &#93; &#91; MDNServiceWorkerApi &#93; . Use service worker threads to act as network proxies between your server and client app in order to provide offline support , resource caching , push notifications , background data sync , and page load perf optimizations .
To be a great PWA , your app also needs :
* &#91; X &#93; &#91; Deep linking &#93; &#91; WikiDeepLinking &#93; . Route each page of your site to a unique URL so existing users may help you engage an even broader audience through social media sharing .
To submit your Progressive Web App to the &#91; Microsoft Store &#93; &#91; MicrosoftDeveloperStore &#93; , you must have :
* &#91; X &#93; A &#91; Microsoft developer account &#93; &#91; WindowsUWPPublishDeveloperAccount &#93;

title : Offline and network connectivity support in Progressive Web Apps
# Offline and network connectivity support in Progressive Web Apps
For many years organizations were reluctant to invest heavily in web-based software over native software because web applications depended on stable network connections . Today , the web platform now offers robust options that enable users to continue working , even if the network connection becomes unstable or goes completely offline .
# # Use the caching to improve performance of PWAs
This simple introduction shows how to use caching in your progressive web app ( PWA ) . Each PWA is different and may use different caching strategies . Your code may look different , and you may use different caching strategies for different routes within the same application .
# # Use IndexedDB in your PWA to store structured data
# # Understand storage options for PWAs
&gt; Web Storage is a synchronous process and is not available for use within worker threads such as Service Workers . Heavy usage may create performance issues for your application .
There are 2 types of Web Storage : `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` . Each is maintained as a separate data store isolated to the domain that created it . `sessionStorage` persists only for the duration of the browsing session ( for example , while the browser is open , which includes refresh and restores ) . `localStorage` persists until the data is removed by the code , the user , or the browser ( for example , when there is limited storage available ) . The following code snippet shows how to use `localStorage` , which is similar to how `sessionStorage` is used .
# # Test for network connections in your PWA
The `navigator.onLine` property is a boolean that lets you know the current status of the network . If the value is `true` , the user is online , otherwise the user is offline .

title : Get started with Progressive Web Apps ( Chromium )
# Get started with Progressive Web Apps ( Chromium )
The following guide gives you an overview of PWA basics by creating a simple web app and extending it as a PWA . The finished project works across modern browsers .
&gt; You may use &#91; PWABuilder &#93; &#91; PwaBuilder &#93; to create a new PWA , enhance your existing PWA , or package your PWA for app stores .
* Use &#91; Node.js &#93; &#91; NodejsMain &#93; as your local web server .
To create an empty web app , follow the steps in &#91; Node Express App Generator &#93; &#91; ExpressjsApplicationGenerator &#93; , and name your app `MySamplePwa` .
In the prompt , run the following commands .
The commands creates an empty web app and install any dependencies .
Now you have a simple , functional web app . To start it , run the following command .
Running your new PWA on localhost
# # Get started building a PWA
The following guide , use `http : / / localhost` to build your PWA .
A &#91; Web App Manifest &#93; &#91; MDNWebAppManifest &#93; is a JSON file containing metadata about your app , such as name , description , icons , and more .
To add an app manifest to the web app :
1 . Press `Ctrl` + `N` to create a new file , and paste in the following code snippet .
# # # Step 3 - Add a Service Worker
Service workers are the key technology behind PWAs , enabling scenarios like offline support , advanced caching , and running background tasks previously limited to native apps .
1 . Copy the downloaded files to the `public` folder in your web app project .
Your web app now has a service worker that uses the cache-first strategy , which fetches resources like images , JS , CSS , and HTML from the cache first , and falls back to the network as needed .

Setting app to offline mode in Microsoft Edge DevTools
# # Add push notifications to your PWA
1 . Display a toast messages when a message is received from the service using the &#91; Notifications API &#93; &#91; MDNNotificationsApi &#93;
As with Service Workers , these are standards-based APIs that work across browsers , so you only have to write the code once for it to work everywhere that PWAs are supported . For more information on delivering push messages to different browsers on your server , use the &#91; Web-Push &#93; &#91; NPMWebPush &#93; open-source library .
The following steps have been adapted from the Push Rich Demo in &#91; Service Worker Cookbook &#93; &#91; ServiceWorkerCookbookPushRichDemo &#93; provided by Mozilla , which has a number of other useful Web Push and service worker recipes .
Service workers handle push events and toast notification interactions in your PWA . To subscribe the PWA to server push notifications , ensure the following conditions are met .
* Your PWA is installed , active and registered
* Your code that performs the subscription task is on the main UI thread of the PWA
In your `pwabuilder-sw-register.js` file , append the following code snippet .
For more information , see &#91; PushManager &#93; &#91; MDNPushManager &#93; and &#91; Web-Push &#93; &#91; NPMWebPushUsage &#93; .
* dismiss the toast notification
* open , focus , or open and focus any open windows
In your `pwabuilder-sw.js` file , add the following handlers .
Perform the following steps to test push notifications in your PWA .
Push a notification from DevTools
If you do not select \ ( or activate \ ) a toast notification , it is dismissed after several seconds and queues up in your Windows Action Center .
* &#91; Encrypt &#93; &#91; NPMWebPushEncrypt &#93; payload data
* &#91; Cross-browser testing &#93; &#91; BrowserStackTestEdgeBrowser &#93;
* Implement best practices such as &#91; Webhint &#93; &#91; Webhint &#93;
* &#91; Progressive Web Apps on MDN web docs &#93; &#91; MDNProgressiveWebApps &#93; .
* &#91; Progressive Web Apps on web.dev &#93; &#91; WebDevProgressiveWebApps &#93; .
Use the ICoreWebView2Host.ZoomFactor property to get the modified zoom factor .
Set the IsBuiltInErrorPageEnabled property .
The CoreWebView2Host owns the CoreWebView2 , and if all references to the CoreWebView2Host go away , the WebView will be closed .
This API initially returns the window passed into CreateCoreWebView2Host .
This is a notification separate from put _ Bounds that tells WebView its parent ( or any ancestor ) HWND moved .
Cleaning up the browser instace will release the resources powering the WebView . The browser instance will be shut down if there are no other WebViews using it .

&gt; ! &#91; The click checkbox is enabled &#93; &#91; ImageJSClickCheckbox &#93;
# # Step 4 : Step through the code
# # Step 5 : Set a line-of-code breakpoint
# # Step 6 : Check variable values
The values of `addend1` , `addend2` , and `sum` look suspicious . They are wrapped in quotes , which means that they are strings . This is a good hypothesis for the explaining the cause of the bug . Now it is time to gather more information . DevTools provides a lot of tools for examining variable values .
# # # Method 1 : The Scope pane
&gt; ! &#91; The Scope pane &#93; &#91; ImageJSScope &#93;
# # # Method 2 : Watch Expressions
The * * Watch Expressions * * tab lets you monitor the values of variables over time . As the name implies , Watch Expressions are not just limited to variables . You are able to store any valid JavaScript expression in a Watch Expression . Try it now :
1 . Type `typeof sum` .
&gt; The Watch Expression pane
&gt; ! &#91; The Watch Expression pane &#93; &#91; ImageJSWatchExpression &#93;
As suspected , `sum` is being evaluated as a string , when it should be a number . You have now confirmed that this is the cause of the bug .
# # # Method 3 : The Console
1 . If you do not have the Console drawer open , press `Escape` to open it . It opens at the bottom of your DevTools window .
1 . Press `Enter` . DevTools evaluates the statement and prints out `6` , which is the result you expect the demo to produce .
# # Step 7 : Apply a fix
If you find a fix for the bug , try out your fix by editing the code and re-running the demo . You do not need to leave DevTools to apply the fix . You are able to edit JavaScript code directly within the DevTools UI . Try it now :
1 . Try out the demo with different values . The demo now calculates correctly .
Congratulations ! You now know how to make the most of Microsoft Edge DevTools when debugging JavaScript . The tools and methods you learned in this tutorial may save you countless hours .
This tutorial only showed you two ways to set breakpoints . DevTools offers many other ways , including :
* Breakpoints on caught or uncaught exceptions .
# # Developing an extension
The first step of this journey is to create a Microsoft Edge extension :
# # Loading and debugging
# # Reporting bugs and getting help
# # Testing your extension
# # Adding the final touches
So your extension works in Microsoft Edge . What happens next ? Before you continue packaging your extension , we strongly recommend you to check out these guides to ensure that your extension is following our best-practice policies :
Now your extension is finally polished up and ready to be packaged . Whether you wish to package it to prepare for submission to the Microsoft Store , or to make it easier to distribute within your development / testing teams , there are plenty of resources available to help you :
&gt; - Your screenshots are correctly sized and are of your extension running in Microsoft Edge
- Publishing a second beta version of their extension as hidden in the Microsoft Store .
- Initially publishing their extension as hidden to monitor initial telemetry before eventually changing its status to visible once a certain level of confidence is reached .
# # That &apos;s it !

# # Map to custom local domains
For example , suppose that your site uses a third-party JavaScript library that only works on the domain `microsoft-edge.devtools`. So , you create an entry in your `hosts` file on your development machine to map this domain to `localhost` \ ( for example , `127.0.0.1 microsoft-edge.devtools` \ ) . After setting up custom domain mapping and port forwarding , view the site on your Android device at the URL `microsoft-edge.devtools` .
# # # Set up port forwarding to proxy server
To set up port forwarding to a proxy :
&gt; The proxy server and your web server must run on different ports .
# # # Configure proxy settings on your device
Next , you need to configure your Android device to communicate with the proxy server .
Now access custom domains on your Android device just like on the development machine .

# # Getting ready for the new Microsoft Edge
&gt; If you opt to download the new Microsoft Edge before taking these updates , there will be some known issues with its behavior in Windows Mixed Reality ( which you can read about below ) .
- Launching any Win32 app , including the new Microsoft Edge , causes the headset display to briefly freeze .
- The WebVR Showcase app is present in the mixed reality home , despite WebVR no longer being supported .
- General improvements to keyboard launch and visuals .
# # # Additional known issues

# Writing a custom Holographic Remoting player app
# # Get the Holographic Remoting NuGet package
The following steps are required to add the NuGet package to a project in Visual Studio .
1 . Open the project in Visual Studio .
# # Modify the Package.appxmanifest of the application
# # Create the player context
As a first step the application should create a player context .
# # Connect to the remote app
1 ) The player app running on HoloLens 2 connects to the remote app .
2 ) The remote app connects to the player app running on HoloLens 2 .
To connect from the player app to the remote app call the ```Connect``` method on the player context specifying the hostname and port . The default port is * * 8265 * * .
# # Handling connection related events
1 ) OnConnected : Triggered when a connection to the remote app has been successfully established .
2 ) OnDisconnected : Triggered if an established connection is terminated or a connection could not be established .
&gt; Possible ```ConnectionFailureReason``` values are documented in the ```Microsoft.Holographic.AppRemoting.idl``` &#91; file &#93; ( # idl ) .
3 ) OnListening : When listening for incoming connections starts .
Additionally the connection state can be queried using the ```ConnectionState``` property on the player context .
# # Display the remotely rendered frame
&gt; ```PlayerContext : : BlitRemoteFrame``` potentially overwrites the focus point for the current frame .
On success , ```BlitRemoteFrame``` returns ```BlitResult : : Success _ Color``` . Otherwise it returns the failure reason :

title : Bounding box and App bar
# Bounding box and App bar
Bounding is the standard interface for object manipulation in Mixed Reality . It provides the user an affordance that the object is currently adjustable . On HoloLens 2 , the bounding box works with direct hand manipulation and responds to the user &apos;s finger &apos;s proximity . It shows visual feedback to help the user perceive the distance from the object .
# # # Scaling an object &lt; br &gt;
* Video loop : Scaling an object via bounding box *
* Video loop : Rotating an object via bounding box *
On HoloLens 2 , there is an additional visual cue which can help the user &apos;s perception of depth . A ring near their fingertip shows up and scales down as the fingertip gets closer to the object . The ring eventually converges into a dot when the pressed state is reached . This visual affordance helps the user understand how far they are from the object . &lt; br &gt;

title : Advanced HoloLens Emulator and Mixed Reality Simulator input
# Advanced HoloLens Emulator and Mixed Reality Simulator input
To get started controlling the virtual input to the HoloLens Emulator and Windows Mixed Reality simulator , you should first understand a few concepts .
* * * Yaw * * : Turn left or right .
* * * Pitch * * : Turn up or down .
* * * Roll * * : Roll side-to-side .
* * * Action * * : This simulates the action of pressing the forefinger to the thumb or pulling the action button on a controller . For example , the Action input can be used to simulate the air-tap gesture , to scroll through content , and to press-and-hold .
* * * Tracking * * : Cycles through the positional tracking modes . This includes :
* * * Orientation * * : Forces Orientation-only tracking , regardless of the requests made of the system .
* * * Positional * * : Forces Positional tracking , regardless of the requests made of the system .

# 4 . Making your scene interactive
* Downloading the Mixed Reality Toolkit UX Tools plugin
* Adding Hand Interaction Actors to your fingertips
2 . Create a new folder called * * Plugins * * in the root folder of the project . Copy the unzipped UXTools plugin into this folder and restart the Unreal editor .
&gt; If you don ’ t see the * * UXTools Content * * section in the * * Content Browser * * , click * * View Options &gt; Show Plugin Content * * .
Hand interaction with UX elements is performed with Hand Interaction Actors , which create and drive the pointers and visuals for near and far interactions .
In our case , adding a Hand Interaction Actor to * * MRPawn * * will :
- Add a cursor to the tips of the Pawn ’ s index fingers .
- Provide articulated hand input events that can be manipulated through the Pawn .
Once you &apos;re ready , open the * * MRPawn * * Blueprint and go to the * * Event Graph * * .
1 . Drag and release the execution pin from * * Event BeginPlay * * to place a new node .
2 . Drag and release the execution pin from the * * SpawnActor Uxt Hand Interaction * * node and search for the * * Set Hand * * function in the * * Uxt Hand Interaction Actor * * class .
3 . Spawn a second * * Uxt Hand Interaction Actor * * , this time setting the hand to * * Right * * . When the event begins , a Uxt Hand Interaction Actor will be spawned on each hand .
Both Uxt Hand Interaction Actors need owners and initial transform locations . The initial transform doesn ’ t matter since the Hand Interaction Actors will jump to the virtual hands as soon as they &apos;re visible ( this behavior is included in the UX Tools plugin ) . However , the `SpawnActor` function requires a Transform input to avoid a compiler error , so you &apos;ll use the default values .
1 . Drag and release the pin off one of the * * Spawn Transform * * pins to place a new node .
3 . Click the * * down arrow * * at the bottom of both * * SpawnActor * * nodes to reveal the * * Owner * * pin .
* Drag the pin off one of the * * Owner * * pins and release to place a new node .
A Manipulator is a component that responds to articulated hand input and can be grabbed , rotated , and translated . Applying the Manipulator ’ s transform to an Actors transform allows direct Actor manipulation .
1 . Open the * * Board * * blueprint , click * * Add Component * * and search for * * Uxt Generic Manipulator * * in the * * Components * * panel .
2 . Expand the * * Generic Manipulator * * section in the * * Details * * panel . You can set one-handed or two-handed manipulation , rotation mode , and smoothing from here . Feel free to select whichever modes you wish , then * * Compile * * and * * Save * * Board .
3 . Repeat the steps above for the * * WhiteKing * * Actor .
# # Testing the scene
- Hold down the * * left Alt * * key to control the * * left hand * * and the * * left Shift * * key to control the * * right hand * * .

title : Testing your app on HoloLens
# Testing your app on HoloLens
Testing HoloLens applications are very similar to testing Windows applications . All the usual areas should be considered ( functionality , interoperability , performance , security , reliability , etc . ) . There are , however , some areas that require special handling or attention to details that are not usually observed in PC or phone apps . Holographic apps need to run smoothly in a diverse set of environments . They also need to maintain performance and user comfort at all times . Guidance for testing these areas is detailed in this topic .
# # Testing 3D in 3D
# # # Environmental test matrix
Make sure the hologram interactions work with your chosen &#91; interaction model &#93; ( interaction-fundamentals.md ) .
* * Validate when your app has a different behavior with mouse and touch . * * This will identify inconsistencies and help with design decisions to make the experience more natural for users . For example , triggering an action based on hover .
# # # Custom voice commands
&#91; Voice input &#93; ( voice-input.md ) is a natural form of interaction . The user experience can be magical or confusing depending on your choice of commands and how you expose them . As a rule , you should not use system voice commands such as &quot; Select &quot; or &quot; Hey Cortana &quot; as custom commands . Here are a few points to consider :
Users can interact with your App through &#91; peripherals &#93; ( hardware-accessories.md ) . Apps don &apos;t need to do anything special to take advantage of that capability , however there are a couple things worth checking .
* LED states that indicate battery power *
Validate core app functionality when switching between apps , especially if you &apos;ve implemented a background task . Copy / Paste and Cortana integration are also worth checking where applicable .
1 . How are users using the space ?
4 . How much time do they spend in the app ?
6 . Are users hitting unexpected states and / or errors ?
The &#91; HoloLens emulator &#93; ( using-the-hololens-emulator.md ) is a great way to efficiently test your Holographic app with a variety of simulated user characteristics and spaces . Here are some suggestions for effectively using the emulator to test your app :
# # Automated testing with Perception Simulation
# # Windows App Certification Kit
* &#91; Submitting an app to the Windows Store &#93; ( submitting-an-app-to-the-microsoft-store.md )
# # Types of progress
# # # Progress bar &lt; br &gt;

title : Spatial audio tutorials - 2 . Spatializing button interaction sounds
# Spatializing button interaction sounds
In this second chapter of the spatial audio module of the HoloLens 2 tutorials , you &apos;ll :
* Spatialize the button click sounds
# # Add a button
In this step , you &apos;ll spatialize the audio feedback for the button . For related design suggestions , see &#91; spatial sound design &#93; ( spatial-sound-design.md ) .
Your * * Mixer * * pane will now look like this :
&gt; Until reverb is enabled in &#91; Chapter 5 &#93; ( unity-spatial-audio-ch5.md ) , the mixer &apos;s volume meter doesn &apos;t show activity for sounds played through the Microsoft Spatializer
By default , Unity will attenuate spatialized sounds as they get farther from the listener . When this attenuation is applied to interaction feedback sounds , the interface can become more difficult to use .
Try out your app on a HoloLens 2 , or in the Unity editor . In the app , you can touch the button and hear the spatialized button interaction sounds .
Continue to &#91; Chapter 3 &#93; ( unity-spatial-audio-ch3.md ) to add a video to your app , and spatialize the audio from the video .

# # A hologram is made of light and sound
Holograms can also make &#91; sounds &#93; ( spatial-sound.md ) , which will appear to come from a specific place in your surroundings . On HoloLens , sound comes from two speakers that are located directly above your ears , without covering them .

title : Design your own immersive environments
When using a custom environment you &apos;ll notice that teleporting , interacting with apps , and placing holograms works just like it does in the Cliff House and Skyloft . You can browse the web in a fantasy landscape or fill a futuristic city with holograms - the possibilities are endless !
&lt; td &gt; Custom home environments &lt; / td &gt;
# # Trying a sample environment
* Fantasy Island sample environment * &lt; br &gt;
# # Creating your own custom environment
1 . Users will spawn at 0,0,0 so center your desired spawn location around the origin .
2 . Working Units should be set to meters so that assets can be authored at world scale .
3 . The Up axis should be set to “ Y ” .
4 . The asset should face “ forward ” towards the positive Z axis .
# # # Exporting your environment
# # # Optimizing your environment
Flag &#124; Recommended Value ( s ) &#124; Description
-max-texture-size &#124; 1024 or 2048 &#124; Tweak this to improve the quality of the textures , default is 512x512 . Note that a larger value will significantly impact the file size of the environment so keep the 256 mb limit in mind
-min-version &#124; 1803 &#124; Custom environments are only supported on versions of windows &gt; = 1803 . This flag will remove textures for older versions and reduce the file size of the final asset
# # # Testing your environment
# # Troubleshooting and tips
# # # How do I change the name of the environment ?
# # # How do I default to my favorite custom environment ?
# # # I spawn into a blank space
You can add optional optimizations to your environment to make it load faster . See &#91; &quot; Optimizing your environment &quot; &#93; ( # optimizing-your-environment ) for details .
# # # The scale of my environment is incorrect
# # # The spawn location in my environment is incorrect
The default spawn location is located at 0,0,0 in the environment . Its not currently possible to customize this location , so you must modify the spawn point by exporting your environment with the origin positioned at the desired spawn point .

title : Spatial mapping
&lt; td &gt; Spatial mapping &lt; / td &gt;
The two primary object types used for spatial mapping are the &apos; Spatial Surface Observer &apos; and the &apos; Spatial Surface &apos; .
As the HoloLens gathers new data about the environment , and as changes to the environment occur , spatial surfaces will appear , disappear and change .
# # Spatial Mapping vs. Scene Understanding WorldMesh
* Spatial Mapping API :
* Provides low latency updates of changed mesh regions through SurfacesChanged events .
* Scene understanding SDK :
* Consistent level of details controlled by RequestedMeshLevelOfDetail setting .
# # What influences spatial mapping quality ?
# # Common usage scenarios
&gt; HoloLens 2 implements a new &#91; Scene Understanding Runtime &#93; ( scene-understanding.md ) , that provides Mixed Reality developers with a structured , high-level environment representation designed to simplify the implementation of placement , occlusion , physics and navigation .
# # Using The Surface Observer
The starting point for spatial mapping is the surface observer . Program flow is as follows :
* Create a surface observer object
* You may &apos; poll &apos; the surface observer for spatial surface status at any time . Alternatively , you may register for the surface observer &apos;s &apos; surfaces changed &apos; event , which will notify the application when spatial surfaces have changed .
* For a static volume , such as a world-locked cube covering a single room , applications may register for the &apos; surfaces changed &apos; event to be notified when spatial surfaces inside that volume may have changed .
* Iterate the provided set of spatial surfaces .
* Classify spatial surfaces as added , changed or removed .
* Process the asynchronous mesh request ( more details in following sections ) .
When interpreting the &apos; surfaces changed &apos; event provided by the surface observer , the basic mesh caching logic is as follows :
* For new spatial surfaces , should mesh be requested ?
* If the new mesh is not needed , if for example the application has permanently or temporarily &apos; frozen &apos; its model of the environment , then it should not be requested .
* For removed spatial surfaces , should mesh be discarded ?
* Consider an application that wishes to use a frustum-shaped spatial volume of interest that follows the user &apos;s gaze as they look around and walk around .
* To reduce the number of changes processed , the application uses two spatial surface observers , one contained within the other . The larger volume is spherical and follows the user &apos; lazily &apos; ; it only moves when necessary to ensure that its centre is within 2.0 metres of the user .
* Since a spatial surface may also disappear temporarily due to tracking loss , the application also defers discarding removed spatial surfaces during tracking loss .
* It is often useful to visualize spatial surfaces directly . For example , casting &apos; shadows &apos; from objects onto spatial surfaces can provide helpful visual feedback to the user while they are placing holograms on surfaces .
* For occluding holograms behind real-world surfaces
&#91; Performance &#93; ( understanding-performance-for-mixed-reality.md ) is an important concern when rendering spatial mapping meshes . Here are some rendering performance techniques specific to rendering spatial mapping meshes :
* Frustum culling skips drawing objects that cannot be seen because they are outside the current display frustum . This reduces both CPU and GPU processing costs .
* Since culling is performed on a per-mesh basis and spatial surfaces can be large , breaking each spatial surface mesh into smaller chunks may result in more efficient culling ( in that fewer offscreen triangles are rendered ) . There is a tradeoff , however ; the more meshes you have , the more draw calls you must make , which can increase CPU costs . In an extreme case , the frustum culling calculations themselves could even have a measurable CPU cost .
* Spatial surfaces tend to be large , because they represent the user &apos;s entire environment surrounding them . Pixel processing costs on the GPU can thus be high , especially in cases where there is more than one layer of visible geometry ( including both spatial surfaces and other holograms ) . In this case , the layer nearest to the user will be occluding any layers further away , so any GPU time spent rendering those more distant layers is wasted .
Because each surface observer can provide multiple unconnected spatial surfaces , some applications may wish to clip these spatial surface meshes against each other , then zipper them together . In general , the clipping step is required , as nearby spatial surface meshes often overlap slightly .
* They are &apos; water-tight &apos; . Surfaces intended to be solid should not have small holes in them ; even holes too small to be visible can cause problems .
* They are converted into convex hulls . Convex hulls have few polygons and are free of holes , and they are much more computationally efficient to process than raw triangle meshes .
# # The environment scanning experience
* Example of scanning *
* For this case , the spatial surface observer &apos;s bounding volumes should be updated each frame to a body-locked &#91; spatial coordinate system &#93; ( coordinate-systems.md ) , so that they follow the user .
* For example , the application may require an empty area around the user so they can safely practice holographic kung-fu .
* For this case , the spatial surface observer &apos;s bounding volumes should use a world-locked &#91; spatial coordinate system &#93; ( coordinate-systems.md ) in the chosen location .
* * * Find a suitable configuration of surfaces * *
* For example , a game may put the user in the role of Gulliver , under siege from hundreds of tiny Lilliputians approaching from all directions .
* * * Take an initial snapshot of the environment * *
* An application may wish to ignore all changes in the environment after taking an initial &apos; snapshot &apos; .
* * * Take user-initiated snapshots of the environment * *
* For example , the user could create multiple 3D &apos; statues &apos; of a friend by capturing their poses at different moments .
* * * Allow the user to change the environment * *
* For example , the user drawing a curtain could trigger &apos; scene change &apos; for a holographic play taking place on the other side .
* * * Guide the user to avoid errors in the spatial mapping data * *
Bear in mind that spatial mapping data is intended to be as faithful as possible to real-world surfaces , so any processing you apply risks shifting your surfaces further from the &apos; truth &apos; .
* Holes affect raycasts : if you are using raycasts to help users interact with surfaces , it may be undesirable for these rays to pass through holes . One mitigation is to use a bundle of multiple raycasts covering an appropriately sized region . This will allow you to filter &apos; outlier &apos; results , so that even if one raycast passes through a small hole , the aggregate result will still be valid . However , be aware that this approach comes at a computational cost .
* It is possible to algorithmically fill such holes in the surface mesh . However , you will need to tune your algorithm so that &apos; real holes &apos; such as windows and doorways do not get filled in . It can be difficult to reliably differentiate &apos; real holes &apos; from &apos; imaginary holes &apos; , so you will need to experiment with different heuristics such as &apos; size &apos; and &apos; boundary shape &apos; .
* Reflections , bright lights and moving objects can leave small lingering &apos; hallucinations &apos; floating in mid-air .
* Hallucinations affect occlusion : hallucinations may become visible as dark shapes moving in front of and occluding other holograms .
* It is possible to filter such hallucinations from the surface mesh . However , as with holes , you will need to tune your algorithm so that real small objects such as lamp-stands and door handles do not get removed .
* One simple example is &apos; plane finding &apos; ; identifying bounded , mostly-planar regions of surfaces .
* Planar regions can be used as in the real world , for holographic counterparts to functional objects such as LCD screens , tables or whiteboards .
* Planar regions can define play areas , forming the basis of videogame levels .
# # Prototyping and debugging
* To reproduce a scenarios , capture spatial mapping data over the network from a live HoloLens , then save it to disk and reuse it in subsequent debugging sessions .
# # # General prototyping guidance
* Don &apos;t get trapped in the habit of always testing in the same location , for example at your desk . Make sure to test on various surfaces of different positions , shapes , sizes and materials .
* It is a good idea to perform testing with real ( and ideally un-coached ) users , because they may not use the HoloLens or your application in exactly the same way that you do . In fact , it may surprise you how divergent people &apos;s behavior , knowledge and assumptions can be !
* In order for the surface meshes to be orientated correctly , each GameObject needs to be active before it is sent to the SurfaceObserver to have its mesh constructed . Otherwise , the meshes will show up in your space but rotated at weird angles .

To target Windows Mixed Reality , you first need to set your Unity project to export as a Universal Windows Platform app :
You then need to let Unity know that the app you are trying to export should create an &#91; immersive view &#93; ( app-views.md ) instead of a 2D view . You do that by enabling &quot; Virtual Reality Supported &quot; :
&#124; Capability &#124; APIs requiring capability &#124;
&#124; WebCam &#124; PhotoCapture and VideoCapture &#124;
&#124; PicturesLibrary / VideosLibrary &#124; PhotoCapture or VideoCapture , respectively ( when storing the captured content ) &#124;
&#124; Microphone &#124; VideoCapture ( when capturing audio ) , DictationRecognizer , GrammarRecognizer , and KeywordRecognizer &#124;
&#124; InternetClient &#124; DictationRecognizer ( and to use the Unity Profiler ) &#124;
HoloLens has a mobile-class GPU . If your app is targeting HoloLens , you &apos;ll want the quality settings tuned for fastest performance to ensure we maintain full framerate :

# # # Create spatial anchors where users place them
Typically , users are the ones explicitly placing spatial anchors .
# # # Always render anchored holograms within 3 meters of their anchor

# # Trying the experience with spatial alignment
&gt; Azure Spatial Anchors can not run in Unity . Consequently , to test the Azure Spatial Anchors functionality , you need to deploy the project to a minimum of two HoloLens devices .
If you now build and deploy the Unity project to two HoloLens devices , you can achieve spatial alignment between the devices by sharing the Azure Anchor ID . To test it out , you can follow these steps :

# OpenXR app best practices
# # Best practices for visual quality and stability
# # # Submit depth buffer for projection layers
This improves hologram stability by enabling hardware depth reprojection on HoloLens 2 .
# # # Choose a reasonable depth range
Prefer a narrower depth range to scope the virtual content to help hologram stability on HoloLens .
For example , the OpenXrProgram.cpp sample is using 0.1 to 20 meters .
Therefore , following these best practices to make best use of the depth resolution becomes more important .
# # # Prepare for different environment blend modes
Applications typically establish some root world coordinate space to connect views , actions and holograms together .
# # # Associate hologram with spatial anchor
# # # Support mixed reality capture
Although HoloLens 2 &apos;s primary display uses additive environment blending , when the user initiates &#91; mixed reality capture &#93; ( mixed-reality-capture-for-developers.md ) , the app &apos;s rendering content will be alpha-blended with the environment video stream .
As a mobile device with hardware reprojection support , HoloLens 2 has stricter requirements to obtain optimal performance . There are a number of ways to submit composition data through `xrEndFrame` which will result in post-processing that will have a noticeable performance penalty .
# # # Select a swapchain format
* * Performance Warning : * * Using a format other than the primary swapchain color format will result in runtime post-processing which comes at a significant performance penalty .
Always render with the recommended view configuration width / height ( `recommendedImageRectWidth` and `recommendedImageRectHeight` from `XrViewConfigurationView` ) , and always use `xrLocateViews` API to query for the recommended view pose , fov , and other rendering parameters before rendering .
Always use the `XrFrameEndInfo.predictedDisplayTime` from the latest `xrWaitFrame` call when querying for poses and views .
# # # Use a single projection layer
HoloLens 2 has limited GPU power for applications to render content and a hardware compositor optimized for a single projection layer .
* * Performance Warning : * * Submitting anything but a single protection layer will result in runtime post-processing which comes at a significant performance penalty .
# # # Render with texture array and VPRT
Create one `xrSwapchain` for both left and right eye using `arraySize = 2` for color swapchain , and one for depth .
Use a shader with VPRT and instanced draw calls for stereoscopic rendering to minimize GPU load .
# # # Avoid quad layers
* * Performance Warning : * * Providing additional layers beyond a single projection layer , such as quad layers , will result in runtime post-processing which comes at a significant performance penalty .

# Writing a Holographic Remoting remote app
# # Create the remote context
As a first step the application should create a remote context .

title : Recommended settings for Unity
Unity provides a set of default options that are generally the average case for all platforms . However , Unity offers some behaviors specific to mixed reality that can be toggled through project settings .
In Unity 2018 LTS + , the project &apos;s quality level can be set by :
# # # Single pass instancing rendering path
To enable this feature in your Unity Project
Read the following articles from Unity for more details with this rendering approach .
# # # Enable depth buffer sharing
In order for the Windows Mixed Reality platform to optimize hologram stability , it relies on the depth buffer to be accurate and match any rendered holograms on screen . Thus , with depth buffer sharing on , it is important when rendering color , to also render depth . In Unity , most Opaque or TransparentCutout materials will render depth by default but transparent and text objects will generally not render depth although this is shader dependent , etc .
1 ) Select the transparent material that is using the MRTK Standard shader and open the Inspector editor window
# # # Building for IL2CPP
1 ) Leverage incremental building by building your project to the same directory every time , re-using the pre-built files there
2 ) Disable anti-malware software scans for your project &amp; build folders
3 ) Utilize an SSD for building

When the headset is unable to locate itself in the world , the headset is said to have * lost tracking * . In these cases , functionality dependent on world-locked coordinate systems , such as spatial stages , spatial anchors and spatial mapping , do not work .

title : Mixed Reality Spatial Data Packager Documentation
# Mixed Reality Spatial Data Packager Documentation
&gt; This tool and its operation are offered as-is . It is subject to change without any notice and may not be compatible with future Windows or Windows Mixed Reality HMD releases .
&lt; td &gt; Mixed Reality Spatial Data Packager &lt; / td &gt;
1 . Tool must be run with administrator privileges
2 . You may have to restart PC if Mixed Reality Portal is unstable after running the tool
3 . Tool will not run when encountering spatial data version mismatches or incompatibilities
5 . If import process fails previous data cannot be restored unless it has been backed up by exporting previously
6 . Quality of import functionality contingent on “ Read-Only ” mode for spatial map data
# # Mapping Best Practices
1 . Clear existing maps from the Control Panel ( Settings - &gt; Mixed Reality - &gt; Environment - &gt; Clear environment data )
2 . Ensure sufficient lighting for good tracking and if running locked map mode try to maintain the same lighting
3 . When possible keep the lighting dynamic range low by avoiding areas of high illumination next to dark , shadowed areas
4 . Minimize blank , textureless surfaces e.g. place a range of different posters on white walls
5 . Map the space without dynamic objects in the scene such as moving people
6 . Lock the map on import ( available via Insider Preview )
7 . Unlock the map and rescan the environment when tracking quality degrades and / or there are changes in the environment ( lighting or changes in object layout )
We have provided MRSpatialPackagerHelperScript.ps1 that runs the map packager the tools .
# # # Powershell Script Example Usage and Output
# # # How to Export using MixedRealityPackager.exe
Exporting maps off device generates two mapx files , het.mapx and sa.mapx. During the export process all spatial anchors are removed except for the specified app and the user-created boundary ( if it exists ) . The source package family name must match an existing installed app or the exe will fail .

title : The Making of Galaxy Explorer for HoloLens 2
# The Making of Galaxy Explorer for HoloLens 2
This is a big change from the Air Tap-based interfaces on first generation HoloLens devices . Instead of interacting with holograms from a distance , users can now get &quot; up close and personal &quot; . When porting existing experiences over to HoloLens 2 or planning new ones , it is important to make yourself familiar with the direct manipulation of holograms .
# # # Direct manipulation vs. the vast distances in space
# # # Force grab prototyping
# # # Implementing force grab into the application
In picture : Jenny Kam , Senior Design Lead , testing a work-in-progress of Galaxy Explorer .
# # # Adding affordances for targeting
# # # Adding affordances for force grab
# # Spotlight on Jupiter
# # # Geometry and meshes
# # # Rotation and texture behavior
# # # The Great Red Spot
We used a similar mechanism as with Jupiter &apos;s bands : a set of rotating parts was composed on top of each other , while also being grouped under its &apos; master layer &apos; to ensure they remain in position no matter how fast the rest moves .
# # # Getting it right in Unity
There are a couple of key things to keep in mind when implementing this in Unity .
Finally the Alpha Blends needed to be set up by setting the Source Blend to 10 as well as the Destination Blend to 5 .
You can see the final rendering of Jupiter in Galaxy Explorer !

The SceneUnderstanding SDK is downloadable via NuGet .
* * Note : * * the latest release depends on preview packages and you will need to enable pre-release packages to see it .
SceneUnderstanding requires Windows SDK version 18362 or higher .
SceneObjects can have any one of the following :
# # # # Winding Order and Coordinate Systems
Note : OS builds prior to .191105 may have a known bug where &quot; World &quot; meshes were returning in Counter-Clockwise winding order , which has subsequently been fixed .
# # # # SceneQuad shape
# # Scene understanding SDK details and reference
Scenes are computed using a SceneObserver . Before creating a Scene , your application should query your device to ensure that it supports SceneUnderstanding , as well as to request user access for information that SceneUnderstanding needs .
If RequestAccessAsync ( ) is not called , computing a new Scene will fail . Next we will compute a new scene that &apos;s rooted around the Mixed Reality headset and has a 10 meter radius .
# # Accessing Meshes and Quads from Scene Objects
# # # Dealing with Transforms
Each `SceneObject` has a `Position` and `Orientation` property which can be used to position corresponding content relative to the origin of the containing `Scene` . For example , the following example assumes that the game is a child of the scene root , and assigns its local position and rotation to align to a given `SceneObject` :
The index / vertex buffers must be &gt; = the index / vertex counts , but otherwise can be arbitrarily sized allowing for efficient memory re-use .
# # Developing with scene understandings
At this point you should understand the core building blocks of the scene understanding runtime and SDK . The bulk of the power and complexity lies in access patterns , interaction with 3D frameworks , and tools that can be written on top of these APIs to perform more advanced tasks like spatial planning , room analysis , navigation , physics etc . We hope to capture these in samples that should hopefully guide you in the proper direction to make your scenarios shine . If there are samples / scenarios we are not addressing , please let us know and we will try to document / prototype what you need .
If you have a HoloLens2 you can save any scene you &apos;ve captured by saving the output of ComputeSerializedAsync to file and deserializing it at your own convenience .

title : Enable placement of 3D models in the home
# Enable placement of 3D models in the mixed reality home
&lt; td &gt; Add model protocol &lt; / td &gt;
There are 2 steps to enabling the placement of 3D models in the Windows Mixed Reality home :
# # Considerations for immersive ( VR ) headsets
* When invoking the * add model protocol * from the desktop with the Mixed Reality Portal already running , ensure that the headset is &quot; awake &quot; . If not , the placement will not succeed .
title : Coordinate systems in DirectX
# # Spatial coordinate systems in Windows
Your application should not create SpatialCoordinateSystems directly - rather they should be consumed via the Perception APIs . There are three primary sources of coordinate systems in the Perception APIs , each of which map to a concept described on the &#91; Coordinate systems &#93; ( coordinate-systems.md ) page :
* Left-hand and right-hand coordinate systems *
Code for * * Spatial stage initialization * *
Code for * * Spatial stage update * *
# # Place holograms in the world using a stationary frame of reference
From the Windows Holographic app template code :
# # # Persist and share spatial anchors
# # # Create SpatialAnchors for holographic content
For this code sample , we modified the Windows Holographic app template to create anchors when the * * Pressed * * gesture is detected . The cube is then placed at the anchor during the render pass .
Since multiple anchors are supported by the helper class , we can place as many cubes as we want using this code sample !
Let &apos;s see how to write a SampleSpatialAnchorHelper class that helps handle this persistence , including :
* Storing a collection of in-memory anchors , indexed by a Platform : : String key .
* Loading anchors from the system &apos;s SpatialAnchorStore , which is kept separate from the local in-memory collection .
When the class starts up , we request the SpatialAnchorStore asynchronously . This involves system I / O as the API loads the anchor store , and this API is made asynchronous so that the I / O is non-blocking .
&gt; Don &apos;t forget to hook up the suspend / resume events to save and load the anchor store .
# # # Save content to the anchor store
# # # Clear the anchor store , when needed
2 . If so , it provides you a transform to go directly from one coordinate system to the other .
# # Create holograms using a device-attached frame of reference
To get a SpatialLocatorAttachedFrameOfReference , use the SpatialLocator class and call CreateAttachedFrameOfReferenceAtCurrentHeading .
Note that this applies to the entire range of Windows Mixed Reality devices .
# # # Use a reference frame attached to the device
First , we changed the template to store a SpatialLocatorAttachedFrameOfReference instead of a SpatialStationaryFrameOfReference :
# # # Get a spatial pointer pose , and follow the user &apos;s Gaze
We want our example hologram to follow the user &apos;s &#91; gaze &#93; ( gaze-and-commit.md ) , similar to how the holographic shell can follow the user &apos;s gaze . For this , we need to get the SpatialPointerPose from the same time stamp .
# # # Rotate the hologram to face the camera
# # # Render the attached hologram
That &apos;s it ! The hologram will now &quot; chase &quot; a position that is 2 meters in front of the user &apos;s gaze direction .
&gt; This example also loads additional content - see StationaryQuadRenderer.cpp .
# # Handling tracking loss
When the device cannot locate itself in the world , the app experiences &quot; tracking loss &quot; . Windows Mixed Reality apps should be able to handle such disruptions to the positional tracking system . These disruptions can be observed , and responses created , by using the LocatabilityChanged event on the default SpatialLocator .

Continue to &#91; Chapter 4 &#93; ( unity-spatial-audio-ch4.md ) to use the button to enable and disable spatialization at run time .
title : Mixed Reality Dev Days Session Recordings
# Session details and recordings
Your mixed reality application can invoke the system keyboard at any time . Note that the system keyboard will behave according to the target platform &apos;s capabilities , for example the keyboard on HoloLens 2 supports direct hand interactions , while the keyboard on HoloLens ( 1st gen ) supports gaze and air-tap gesture input .
# # System keyboard in MRTK ( Mixed Reality Toolkit ) for Unity
# # What is OpenXR ?
Note that OpenXR is not itself a mixed reality engine . Instead , OpenXR enables engines like Unity and Unreal to write portable code once that can then access the native platform features of the user &apos;s holographic or immersive device , regardless of which vendor built that platform .
There are three kinds of OpenXR extensions :
* * * Vendor extensions ( e.g. `MSFT` ) : * * Enables per-vendor innovation in hardware or software features . Any runtime vendor can introduce and ship a vendor extension at any time .
&#124; Feature area &#124; Extension availability &#124;
While some of these extensions may start out as vendor-specific `MSFT` extensions , Microsoft and other OpenXR runtime vendors are working together to design cross-vendor `EXT` or `KHR` extensions for many of these feature areas . This will enable the code you write for those features to be portable across runtime vendors , just as with the core specification .
# # Get started with OpenXR
title : Asset creation process
# # Things to consider
* How many triangles / polygons ?
1 . Creating Assets ( Authoring tools and object capture )
2 . Purchasing Assets ( Buying assets online )
3 . Porting Assets ( Taking existing assets )
4 . Outsourcing Assets ( Importing assets from 3rd parties )
* * Authoring tools * * &lt; br &gt;
* * Object capture * * &lt; br &gt;
* Does it fit within your budget ?
* * * Is the source file available ? * *
* Without the source file you won &apos;t be able to modify the asset .
* * * Know what you &apos;re getting * *
* Are animations provided ?
* Make sure to check the contents list of the asset you &apos;re purchasing .
When porting assets to use in your HoloLens application you will want to ask the following :
* * * If converting to a compatible format is anything lost ? * * Sometimes details can be lost or importing can cause artifacts that need to be cleaned up in a 3D authoring tool .
* * * Clearly define what you &apos;re requesting * *
* Front , side and back concept images
* Scale of object ( Usually specified in centimeters )
* Poly count range
* Type of shader ( For Unity and HoloLens you should always default to mobile shaders first )

# Implement 3D app launchers ( Win32 apps )
* These will be used for the app ’ s 2D logo in the Windows Mixed Reality All Apps list and for the Start Menu on desktop .
* * Optional : * You can use a resources.pri file if you would like for MRT to provide multiple asset sizes for different resolution scales and high contrast themes .
4 . Save the file with the same name as your executable file , with an extension of &quot; .VisualElementsManifest.xml &quot; and save it in the same directory . For example , for the executable file &quot; contoso.exe &quot; , the accompanying XML file is named &quot; contoso.visualelementsmanifest.xml &quot; .

# What is mixed reality ?
Over the past several decades , the relationship between human and computer input has been well explored . It even has a widely studied discipline known as * human computer interaction * or HCI . Human input happens through a variety of means , including keyboards , mice , touch , ink , voice , and even Kinect skeletal tracking .
* Image : The interactions between between computers , humans and environments . *
# # The mixed reality spectrum
# # # Augmented vs. virtual reality
* Starting with the physical world , placing a digital object , such as a hologram , as if it was really there .
* Starting with the physical world , a digital representation of another person--an avatar--shows the location where they were standing when leaving notes . In other words , experiences that represent asynchronous collaboration at different points in time .
* Starting with a digital world , physical boundaries from the physical world , such as walls and furniture , appear digitally within the experience to help users avoid physical objects .

# # Devices and experiences
There are two main types of devices that deliver Windows Mixed Reality experiences :
Note , whether a device is connected to or tethered to a separate PC ( via USB cable or Wi-Fi ) or self-contained ( untethered ) does not reflect whether a device is holographic or immersive . Certainly , features that improve mobility lead to better experiences , and both holographic and immersive devices could be tethered or untethered .

title : Spatial mapping in Unity
# Spatial mapping in Unity
This topic describes how to use &#91; spatial mapping &#93; ( spatial-mapping.md ) in your Unity project , retrieving triangle meshes that represent the surfaces in the world around a HoloLens device , for placement , occlusion , room analysis and more .
2 . Lower-level spatial mapping APIs , which provide full control and enable more sophisticated application specific customization
To use spatial mapping in your app , the spatialPerception capability needs to be set in your AppxManifest .
# # Setting the SpatialPerception capability
In order for an app to consume spatial mapping data , the SpatialPerception capability must be enabled .
How to enable the SpatialPerception capability :
Spatial mapping also requires a MaxVersionTested of at least 10.0.10586.0 :
# # # Spatial Mapping Renderer
# # # Spatial Mapping Collider
The Spatial Mapping Collider allows for holographic content ( or character ) interaction , such as physics , with the spatial mapping mesh .
To use these two components in your Unity app :
* To do your own lower-level mesh processing , see the section below about the low-level Spatial Mapping script API .
# # Using the low-level Unity Spatial Mapping API
# # # Set up the SurfaceObserver ( s )
Specify the region of space that each SurfaceObserver object will provide data for by calling either SetVolumeAsSphere , SetVolumeAsAxisAlignedBox , SetVolumeAsOrientedBox , or SetVolumeAsFrustum . You can redefine the region of space in the future by simply calling one of these methods again .
When you call SurfaceObserver.Update ( ) , you must provide a handler for each spatial surface in the SurfaceObserver &apos;s region of space that the spatial mapping system has new information for . The handler receives , for one spatial surface :
# # # Handling Surface Changes
There are several main cases to handle . Added &amp; Updated which can use the same code path and Removed .
* In the Added &amp; Updated cases in the example , we add or get the GameObject representing this mesh from the dictionary , create a SurfaceData struct with the necessary components , then call RequestMeshDataAsync to populate the GameObject with the mesh data and position in the scene .
* In the Removed case , we remove the GameObject representing this mesh from the dictionary and destroy it .
# # # Handling Data Ready
SurfaceObserver.Update ( ) should be called on a delay , not every frame .
After the room has been scanned and finalized , labels are internally generated for surfaces like the floor , ceiling , and walls . The “ PlayspaceRaycast ” function takes a ray and returns if the ray collides with a known surface and if so , information about that surface in the form of a “ RaycastResult ” .
Each of these queries takes a pre-allocated array of “ TopologyResult ” structures . The “ locationCount ” parameter specifies the length of the passed in array . The return value reports the number of returned locations . This number is never greater than the passed in “ locationCount ” parameter .
Note that in the Unity sample , each of these queries is linked up to a button in the virtual UI panel . The sample hard codes the parameters for each of these queries to reasonable values . See SpaceVisualizer.cs in the sample code for more examples .
Inside of the dll , the shape analyzer ( “ ShapeAnalyzer _ W ” ) uses the topology analyzer to match against custom shapes defined by the user . The Unity sample defines a set of shapes and exposes the results out through the in-app query menu , within the shape tab . The intention is that the user can define their own object shape queries and make use of those , as needed by their application .
An example query defined in the Unity sample ( ShapeDefinition.cs ) , for “ sittable ” objects is as follows .
* Rectangle shape is found on this surface *
# # # Object Placement Solver
If successful , a “ ObjectPlacementResult ” structure containing the placement position , dimensions and orientation is returned . In addition , the placement is added to the dll ’ s internal list of placed objects . Subsequent placement queries will take this object into account . The “ LevelSolver.cs ” file in the Unity sample contains more example queries .
# # # Room Scanning Process
* Generated mesh produced from the voxel volume *
* When tracking is lost , the next OnSurfaceChanged event will remove all meshes .

# Using XAML with holographic DirectX apps
# # XAML view switching overview
# # XAML view switching workflow
* The app starts up in the 2D XAML view .
* If not , the XAML view can proceed with business as usual .
# # Tip for rendering graphics across both views
Download the HoloLens Emulator .
# # # HoloLens Emulator system requirements
* 64-bit Windows 10 Pro , Enterprise , or Education
&gt; Windows 10 Home Edition does not support Hyper-V or the HoloLens Emulator .
* CPU with 4 cores ( or multiple CPUs with a total of 4 cores )
* Second Level Address Translation ( SLAT )
* Hardware-based Data Execution Prevention ( DEP )
* WDDM 1.2 graphics driver or later ( 1st gen )
* WDDM 2.5 graphics driver ( HoloLens 2 Emulator )
* The emulator might work with an unsupported GPU , but will be significantly slower
# # Deploying apps to the HoloLens Emulator
1 . Load your application solution in Visual Studio .
&gt; When using Unity , build your project from Unity and then load the built solution into Visual Studio , as usual .
The cursor on HoloLens ( 1st gen ) follows head movement and rotation . In the HoloLens 2 Emulator , the cursor follows hand movement and orientation .
# # # Simulation control panel
* To control the hand , use either the left or right Alt keys on your keyboard or the left or right bumper on the gamepad .
* To control eye gaze direction , click the pushpin in the Eyes section . This is the equivalent of holding down the Y key on the keyboard .
* By default , keyboard input controls the simulated human and simulated input . To have your PC &apos;s keyboard input sent through to the HoloLens , uncheck Use keyboard for simulation . F4 is the shortcut key for this setting .
* If the simulation panel is already visible , pressing F8 moves keyboard focus into it .
The Account tab lets you configure the emulator to sign-in with a Microsoft Account . This is useful for testing APIs that require the user to be signed in with an account . Toggling this option requires that you completely close and restart the HoloLens Emulator for the setting to take effect . If this option is enabled , subsequent launches of the emulator will ask you to sign-in , just like a user would the first time HoloLens is started . To enter your credentials using your PC &apos;s keyboard , first turn off Use keyboard for simulation in the Simulation Control Panel or press F4 on your keyboard to toggle the keyboard setting on or off .
The Diagnostics tab shows the emulator &apos;s IP address in the form of a link to Windows Device Portal along with the status of the virtual GPU .
The Network tab shows the network adapter details for the emulator , as well as network adapter details for the host machine . Note that for the HoloLens 2 Emulator , this tab will only appear when running the emulator on the Windows 10 May 2019 Update or newer .
This tab will only appear when running the emulator on the Windows 10 May 2019 Update or newer .
For example , if you want to access Device Portal on the emulator from a remote PC :
1 . Add an entry for internal port 80 ( the port on which Device Portal is listening ) by double-clicking on a free row in the table . For other applications , enter the port number on which that application is listening .
2 . Choose any available external port . In this example , we &apos;ll use port 8080 as the external port .
4 . Click &quot; Apply Changes &quot; to enable the mapping . The &apos; Status &apos; will change from &apos; Pending &apos; to &apos; Active &apos; .
There are no port mappings by default . Any mappings you configure are persistent across launches of the HoloLens 2 Emulator and will be enabled automatically when the emulator has booted fully .
Use the &apos; Export &apos; button to save your mappings to a file . You can then share this file with other team members who can use the &apos; Import &apos; button to automatically configure the same mappings .
On startup , the emulator will check for new versions . If a new version is available , the emulator will display a prompt showing the version you have , along with the available version and asking if you want to update . If you select &apos; Yes &apos; , the installer for the new version is downloaded .
4 . Scroll the panel to the bottom .
5 . Check the box labeled &quot; Use HMD for simulation &quot;
1 . Temporarily turn off &quot; Use HMD for simulation &quot; .
5 . Enable &quot; Use HMD for simulation &quot; in the emulator .
7 . When the stereo view appears correct , press &apos; S &apos; to save your changes . The new configuration will be saved for future launches of the emulator .
8 . If you want to abandon your changes and revert to the previous configuration , press &apos; L &apos; to load the default or previous configuration .
# # Anatomy of the HoloLens ( 1st gen ) emulator
When the emulator launches , you &apos;ll see a window which displays the HoloLens OS .
The default tab within the * * Additional tools * * pane is the * * Simulation * * tab .
The Simulation tab shows the current state of the simulated sensors used to drive the HoloLens OS within the emulator . Hovering over any value in the Simulation tab provides a tooltip describing how to control that value .
See &#91; simulated rooms &#93; ( # simulated-rooms ) for more information .
The Account tab allows you to configure the emulator to sign-in with a Microsoft Account . This is useful for testing API &apos;s that require the user to be signed-in with an account . After checking the box on this page , subsequent launches of the emulator will ask you to sign-in , just like a user would the first time the HoloLens is started .
* Hardware graphics acceleration may cause Holographic apps to crash on some systems with AMD or Intel graphics . Disabling hardware graphics acceleration in the emulator Tools window works around this issue .
You may also see an error installing the emulator on a non-Pro / Enterprise / Education SKU of Windows or if you do not have Hyper-V feature enabled .
* Also ensure that the Hyper-V feature has been enabled on your system .
* If using Visual Studio 2019 , the Platform Toolset in your project configuration is set to v142 .
If your installation completes successfully , but Visual Studio displays an error attempting to launch the HoloLens Emulator , try the following :
* Run Visual Studio as Administrator

Refer to &#91; Rendering in DirectX &#93; ( rendering-in-directx.md ) article for low-level details about his topic .
When rendering medical MRIs or engineering volumes in 3D , &#91; volume rendering &#93; ( volume-rendering.md ) techniques are often used . These techniques can be particularly interesting in mixed reality , where users can naturally view such a volume from key angles , simply by moving their head .
# # Supported resolutions on HoloLens ( 1st gen )
* The viewport size can be changed by setting the ViewportScaleFactor on the HolographicCamera . This scale factor is in the range of 0 to 1 .

# Case study - Expanding the spatial mapping capabilities of HoloLens
&gt; HoloLens 2 implements a new &#91; Scene Understanding Runtime &#93; ( scene-understanding.md ) , that provides Mixed Reality developers with a structured , high-level environment representation designed to make developing for environmentally aware applications intuitive .

The included SpatialUnderstanding.cs file manages the scanning phase process . It calls the following functions :
* * * Topology queries * * : These are fast queries that are based on the topology of the scanned room .
* * * Object placement queries * * : These are more complex queries that find the best-fit location based on a set of rules and constraints for the object .
The * * TopologyResult * * contains the center position of the returned volume , the facing direction ( i.e. normal ) , and the dimensions of the found space .
Note that in the Unity sample , each of these queries is linked up to a button in the virtual UI panel . The sample hard codes the parameters for each of these queries to reasonable values . See * SpaceVisualizer.cs * in the sample code for more examples .
This function takes an object name , placement definition , and a list of rules and constraints . The C # wrappers provide construction helper functions to make rule and constraint construction easy . The placement definition contains the query type — that is , one of the following :
The blue boxes show the result from three Place On Floor queries with &quot; away from camera position &quot; rules .

# # # Guidance for holographic devices
Although content may occasionally need to be displayed closer than 1m , we recommend against ever presenting holograms closer than 40cm . Thus , we recommend starting to * * fade out content at 40cm and placing a rendering clipping plane at 30cm * * to avoid any nearer objects .
In general , we also recommend careful testing to ensure any interaction requirements ( e.g. , velocity of movement , reachability , etc . ) at near interaction distances remain comfortable for users .
# # # Guidance for immersive devices
# # # # HoloLens ( 1st gen )
2 . Minimizing the overall latency . In an engine with a game thread and a render thread running in lockstep , running at 30FPS can add 33.3ms of extra latency . By reducing latency , this decreases prediction error , and increases hologram stability .
* Profilers built into 3D engines such as the Frame Debugger in Unity
* Humans are very sensitive to the direction of gravity . Therefore , non-user-initiated vertical motions especially should be avoided .
2 . Upon selection , shrink the scene rendering down to a disk around the desired spot .
4 . Upon deselection , resume rendering the entire scene .
3 . Fade the rendering back in after finishing the translation .
Optimal text legibility can help reduce eye strain and maintain user comfort , especially in applications or scenarios that require users to read while in an HMD . Text legibility depends on a variety of factors including various display properties ( for example , pixel density , brightness , contrast ) , lens properties ( for example , chromatic aberration ) , and text / font properties ( for example , the specific font characteristics like weight , spacing , serifs , etc . , color of font , color of background ) .
The minimum legible font size ( measuring from font baseline to ascender ) is approximately 0.35 ° and a comfortable font size is at least approximately 0.5 ° for reading content presented at a distance of 2m to the user .
The minimum legible font size ( measuring from font baseline to ascender ) is at least approximately :
- 0.4 ° -0.5 ° at 45cm ( direct manipulation distance )
The comfortably legible font size ( measuring from font baseline to ascender ) is at least approximately :
- 0.65 ° -0.8 ° at 45cm ( direct manipulation distance )
Note that font sizes need to be slightly larger for text at direct manipulation distances because of the vergence-accommodation conflict described above ( users &apos; eyes are accommodating at a distance of 2.0m on the HoloLens display , so content rendered at , e.g. , 45cm may appear more blurry to users ) .
The optimal ( resting ) gaze angle is considered between 10-20 degrees below horizontal , as the head tends to tilt downward slightly , especially during activities .

After installing the tools , you need to get your app running as a Universal Windows app .
Note : If your application has any dependencies on device specific services , such as match making from Steam , you will need to disable them at this step . At a later time , you can hook up to the equivalent services that Windows provides .
# # # Unity step 5 : ( Deprecated )
* For example , if your project references the SteamVR SDK , you will need to update your project to exclude those prefabs and script API calls when exporting for the Windows Store build target .

title : Head-gaze and dwell
When hands are occupied with tools and parts , gestures can be tedious or impossible . Voice commands , like gestures , can be unreliable in certain contexts , for example under excessively loud conditions . Additionally , using voice to control computers isn &apos;t universally common , but it certainly is gaining steam ! Head-gaze and dwell offers the most familiar and easy-to-master mechanism for working heads-up and hands-free on HoloLens . Additionally , head-gaze and dwell is 100 % reliable independent of noise interference nor silence constraints in the operating environment .
&lt; td &gt; Head-gaze and dwell &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; ✔ ️ Recommended &lt; / td &gt;
* * Say no-no to yo-yo effect * *
The yo-yo effect is an uncomfortable pattern of head movement that can emerge when the placement of content and head-gaze and dwell controls forces people to constantly look up and down repeatedly . For example , a list nav with the head-gaze and dwell button at the bottom induces a loop of - look down to dwell , look up at results , look down to dwell , etc . This resulting pattern is uncomfortable and should be avoided by placing navigation controls in a centralized location that requires less back-and-forth . Placement of dwell buttons relative to their effects becomes important for comfort .
# # UX Guidelines and best practices
Dwell region can be larger than inactive icon to make it easier to use , like the Back button in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides .
# # # Prevent flickering with delayed feedback
* For buttons interacted with frequently , keep the delay very short so the application feels reactive .
High frequency buttons are buttons that are used commonly throughout an application . A good example of these are the next and back buttons in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides . &lt; br &gt;
* Stay near eye height to avoid ergonomic straining . &lt; br &gt;
* Image : Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides next button *
* Show selection highlight on main button .
* For the secondary button , reveal the dwell target on head-gaze . &lt; br &gt;
* Image : Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides confirmation dialog *
* Have the entire row highlight when head-gazed but doesn ’ t begin dwell unless head-gaze is on the specific dwell target .
* Only show the dwell target when the row is highlighted to cut down on visual noise .
* Don &apos;t show all dwell targets at once to avoid repetitive UI .
* Re-use the same pattern as often as possible to establish UX familiarity . &lt; br &gt;

# # Creating the Azure Language Understanding resource
In this section , you will create an Azure prediction resource for the Language Understanding Intelligent Service ( LUIS ) app you will create in the next section .
Click the * * Create * * button to create an instance of this service :
On the Create page , click the * * Prediction * * option and enter the following values :
* For * * Subscription * * , select * * Free Trail * * if you have a trial subscription , otherwise , select one of your other subscriptions
&gt; As of the time of this writing , you do not need to create an authoring resource because an authoring trial key will automatically be generated within LUIS when you create the Language Understanding Intelligent Service ( LUIS ) in the next section .
&gt; If you already have another suitable resource group in your Azure account , for example , if you completed the &#91; Azure Spatial Anchors &#93; ( mrlearning-asa-ch1.md ) tutorial , you may use this resource group instead of creating a new one .
While still on the Create page , enter the following values :
Next , go to the * * Review + create * * tab , review the details , and then click the * * Create * * button , located at the bottom of the page , to create the resource , as well as , the new resource group if you configured one to be created :
&gt; After you click the Create button , you will have to wait for the service to be created , which might take a few minutes .
In this section , you will create a LUIS app , configure and train its prediction model , and connect it to the Azure prediction resource you created in the previous step .
Specifically , you will create an intent that if the user says an action should be taken , the app will trigger the Interactable.OnClick ( ) event on one of the three red buttons in the scene , depending on which button the user references .
For example , if the user says * * go ahead and launch the rocket * * , the app will predict that * * go ahead * * means some * * action * * should be taken , and that the Interactable.OnClick ( ) event to * * target * * is on the * * launch * * button .

* Learn how to save and retrieve Azure Spatial Anchor IDs to and from the HoloLens 2 local disk , for persistence between app sessions
* Learn how to share Azure Spatial Anchor IDs between users in a multi-device scenario
If you build the updated application to your HoloLens , you can now persist Azure Spatial Anchors between app sessions by saving the Azure Anchor ID . To test it out , you can follow these steps :
1 . Move the Rocket Launcher experience to desired location .
3 . Create Azure Anchor ( creates anchors at the location of the Rocket Launcher experience ) .
4 . Save Azure Anchor ID to Disk .
5 . Restart the application .
6 . Get Azure Anchor from Disk ( loads the anchor ID you just saved ) .
# # Share Azure Anchors between multiple devices
If you build the updated application to two HoloLens devices , you can now achieve spatial alignment between them by sharing the Azure Anchor ID . To test it out , you can follow these steps :
1 . On HoloLens device 1 : Move the Rocket Launcher experience to desired location .
5 . On HoloLens device 2 : Start the application .
&gt; If you only have one HoloLens , you can still test the functionality by restarting the application instead of using a second HoloLens device .
In this tutorial you learned how to persist Azure Spatial Anchors between application sessions and application restarts by saving the Azure Spatial Anchor ID to the local disk on HoloLens . You also learned how to share Azure Spatial Anchors between multiple devices for a basic multi-user , static hologram shared experience .
title : Interactable object
# # Important properties of the interactable object
For any objects that user can interact with gaze , hand ray , and motion controller &apos;s ray , we recommend to have different visual cue for these three input states :
* * Default ( Observation ) state * * &lt; br &gt;
* * Targeted ( Hover ) state * * &lt; br &gt;
The cursor is on the object . Hand is detected , ready .
* * Pressed state * * &lt; br &gt;
The cursor is on the object . Hand is detected , air tapped .
Here is what these states look like on a * * holographic button * * :
# # # Near interactions ( direct )
* * * Default ( Observation ) * * : Default idle state of the object .
* * * Hover * * : When a hand is near a hologram , change visuals to communicate that hand is targeting hologram .
* * * Distance and point of interaction * * : As the hand approaches a hologram , design feedback to communicate the projected point of interaction , as well as how far from the object the finger is
* * * Contact begins * * : Change visuals ( light , color ) to communicate that a touch has occurred
* * * Contact ends * * : Change visuals ( light , color ) when touch has ended
* * Hover ( Near ) * * &lt; br &gt;
* * * Contact begins * * : Play sound when touch begins
* * * Grab begins * * : Play sound when grab starts
* * * Grab ends * * : Play sound when grab ends
# # # Voice commanding &lt; br &gt;
For any interactable objects , it is important to support alternative interaction options . By default , we recommend that &#91; voice commanding &#93; ( voice-design.md ) be supported for any objects that are interactable . To improve discoverability , you can also provide a tooltip during the hover state . &lt; br &gt;
* Image : Tooltip for the voice command *
# # # Target size for direct hand interaction
* Target size for direct hand interaction *
# # # Target size for buttons
When creating buttons for direct interaction , we recommend a larger minimum size of 3.2 x 3.2 cm to ensure that there is enough space to contain an icon and potentially some text .

* Example of a low-fidelity storyboard *
Low-fidelity storyboards are the right fidelity for quick discussions , especially when conveying high-level ideas . These can be as simple as stick-figure drawings and primitive shapes to denote virtual elements in a scene or the proximity of interactive components ( both physical and virtual ) . While these are useful given the relative ease and low skill barrier to execute , remember the lesson from bodystorming : Not everyone can see 2D depictions of an experience and understand the 3D implications .

# # HoloLens ( 1st gen ) Long Term Servicing
We &apos;re tracking an issue that requires a monitor to be connected to the PC in order for the immersive headset to work correctly . Backpack PC users may want to use an active display adapter ( or EDID emulator ) to ensure their immersive headset continues to render when no PC monitor is in use .
&gt; Be sure to accept the prompt that asks whether you ’ d like Feedback Hub to access your Documents folder ( select * * Yes * * when prompted ) .
title : Add holographic remoting
# Add Holographic Remoting ( HoloLens ( 1st gen ) )
&gt; Guidance specific to HoloLens 2 can be found &#91; here &#93; ( holographic-remoting-create-host.md ) .
# # # Get the remoting NuGet packages
1 . Go to your project in Visual Studio .
# # # Create the HolographicStreamerHelpers
First , we need an instance of HolographicStreamerHelpers . Add this to the class that will be handling remoting .
# # # Initialize HolographicStreamerHelpers and connect to HoloLens
The OnConnected event can update the UI , start rendering , and so on . In our desktop code sample , we update the window title with a &quot; connected &quot; message .
The OnDisconnected event can handle reconnection , UI updates , and so on . In this example , we reconnect if there is a transient failure .
# # # Render holographic content
To render content using remoting , you set up a virtual IFrameworkView within your desktop or UWP app and process holographic frames from remoting . All of the Windows Holographic APIs are uses the same way by this view , but it is set up slightly differently .
Instead of creating them yourself , the holographic space and speech components come from your HolographicRemotingHelpers class :
Instead of using an update loop inside of a Run method , you provide tick updates from the main loop of your desktop or UWP app . This allows your desktop or UWP app to remain in control of message processing .
The holographic app view &apos;s Tick ( ) method completes one iteration of the update , draw , present loop .
# # # Disconnect and end the remote session
To disconnect - for example , when the user clicks a UI button to disconnect - call Disconnect ( ) on the HolographicStreamerHelpers , and then release the object .
# # Get the remoting player
The Windows Holographic remoting player is offered in the Windows app store as an endpoint for remoting host apps to connect to . To get the Windows Holographic remoting player , visit the Windows app store from your HoloLens , search for Remoting , and download the app . The remoting player includes a feature to display statistics on-screen , which can be useful when debugging remoting host apps .
# # Notes and resources

# MR Sharing 240 : Multiple HoloLens devices
In this tutorial , we will :
* Setup a network for a shared experience .
* Share holograms across HoloLens devices .
# # Before you start
# # Chapter 1 - Holo World
In this chapter , we &apos;ll setup our first Unity project and step through the build and deploy process .
* Setup Unity to develop holographic apps .
* See your hologram !
* Start Unity .
* Select * * Open * * .
* Press * * Play * * a second time to stop preview mode .
* Click * * Add Open Scenes * * to add the scene .
* Single click the * * App * * folder .
* Press * * Select Folder * * .
* When Unity is done , a File Explorer window will appear .
* Open the * * App * * folder .
* Click * * Select * *
* Put on your HoloLens and find the EnergyHub hologram .
# # Chapter 2 - Interaction
* Use gaze input to control a cursor .
* Use gesture input to interact with holograms .
* In the menu , type in the search box * * Gaze Manager * * . Select the search result .
* In the menu , type in the search box * * Hologram Placement * * . Select the search result .
* Save the scene by selecting * * File &gt; Save Scene * * .
* Once the app launches on your HoloLens , move your head around and notice how the EnergyHub follows your gaze .
* Notice how the cursor appears when you gaze upon the hologram , and changes to a point light when not gazing at a hologram .
* Perform an air-tap to place the hologram . At this time in our project , you can only place the hologram once ( redeploy to try again ) .
# # Chapter 3 - Shared Coordinates
* Establish a common reference point .
* Share coordinate systems across devices .
* Everyone sees the same hologram !
&gt; 1 . In the Unity Editor , go to the player settings by navigating to &quot; Edit &gt; Project Settings &gt; Player &quot;
&gt; 2 . Click on the &quot; Windows Store &quot; tab
Next we need to launch the sharing service . Only * * one PC * * in the shared experience needs to do this step .
* Select the * * Launch Sharing Service * * item in the drop-down .
Follow the rest of the instructions on * * all PCs * * that will join the shared experience .
* In the search box , type * * Import Export Anchor Manager * * . Select the search result .
* Replace the contents with the code below .
* In the menu , type in the search box * * App State Manager * * . Select the search result .
* Build the project for your HoloLens devices .
* Designate one HoloLens to deploy to first . You will need to wait for the Anchor to be uploaded to the service before you can place the EnergyHub ( this can take ~ 30-60 seconds ) . Until the upload is done , your tap gestures will be ignored .
* After the EnergyHub has been placed , its location will be uploaded to the service and you can then deploy to all other HoloLens devices .
# # Chapter 4 - Discovery
* Discover each other in our shared experience .
* Choose and share a player avatar .
* In the search box , type * * Local Player Manager * * . Select the search result .
* In the search box , type * * Remote Player Manager * * . Select the search result .
* Build and deploy the project to your HoloLens devices .
* When you hear a pinging sound , find the avatar selection menu and select an avatar with the air-tap gesture .
* If you &apos;re not looking at any holograms , the point light around your cursor will turn a different color when your HoloLens is communicating with the service : initializing ( dark purple ) , downloading the anchor ( green ) , importing / exporting location data ( yellow ) , uploading the anchor ( blue ) . If your point light around your cursor is the default color ( light purple ) , then you are ready to interact with other players in your session !
# # Chapter 5 - Placement
* Place holograms on the spatial mapping mesh based on players ’ head position .
* When the app is ready , stand in a circle and notice how the EnergyHub appears in the center of everyone .
* Tap to place the EnergyHub .
* Try the voice command &apos; Reset Target &apos; to pick the EnergyHub back up and work together as a group to move the hologram to a new location .
# # Chapter 6 - Real-World Physics
* Launch projectiles that bounce off real-world surfaces .
* Share the projectiles so other players can see them .
* Build and deploy to your HoloLens devices .
* See what happens when your projectile collides with another player &apos;s avatar !
# # Chapter 7 - Grand Finale
* When the app has launched , collaborate together to launch projectiles at the EnergyHub .
* When the underworld appears , launch projectiles at underworld robots ( hit a robot three times for extra fun ) .
title : Case study - AfterNow &apos;s process
# # What is Envisioning ?
* * Finance ( optional ) * * - Someone who can explain how the project is funded .
* * Marketing ( optional ) * * - Someone who crafts the company ’ s messages .
* * Customer ( important ) * * - Someone who talks to customers frequently and can be their advocate .
* * Design ( important ) * * - Someone who designs the product your company makes .
# # DAY 1 - Map
Get a bit pragmatic and list out fears in question format . How could we fail ? To meet the long-term goal , what has to be true ? If the project failed , what may have caused that ?
* * Make a flow map - Up to 1 hour * *
* * Interview experts &amp; take notes * *
Our best practice for this process happens when we take individual notes in How might we ( HMW ) format . HMW is a technique developed by P &amp; G in the 70s . It &apos;s a method of note taking in the form of a question which ultimately results in organized and prioritized notes . We will jot down one idea per sticky note which starts with the phrase , &quot; How might we . &quot; For example , how might we communicate the values of &#91; your company &#93; in mixed reality ?
* Organize and decide *
We take all the &quot; How might we &quot; notes and stick them onto a wall . We will then categorize them into noticeable themes as they emerge .
Circle the most important customer and one target moment on the map and look over the initial questions for the sprint . The Decider has the task of making the call .
# # DAY 2 - Sketch
We spend 20 minutes privately jotting down some rough ideas .
* Sketching storyboards *
# # DAY 3 - Decide
This day involves a lot of critiquing and voting . Here &apos;s the breakdown :
* * Discussion &amp; explanations * *
title : Gaze Input in Unreal
&gt; Eye tracking is only supported on HoloLens 2 .
# # Enabling eye tracking
Gaze input needs to be enabled in the HoloLens project settings before you can use any of Unreal &apos;s APIs . When the application starts you &apos;ll see a consent prompt shown in the screenshot below .
&gt; HoloLens eye tracking in Unreal only has a single gaze ray for both eyes instead of the two rays needed for stereoscopic tracking , which is not supported .
That &apos;s all the setup you &apos;ll need to start adding gaze input to your HoloLens 2 apps in Unreal . More information on gaze input and how it affects users in mixed reality can be found at the links below . Be sure to think about these when building your interactive experiences .

# Local anchor transfers in Unity
# # # Setting the SpatialPerception capability
In order for an app to transfer spatial anchors , the * SpatialPerception * capability must be enabled .
How to enable the * SpatialPerception * capability :
3 . Begin the export
4 . Handle the * OnExportDataAvailable * event as data becomes available
We create a * WorldAnchorTransferBatch * to encapsulate what we will be transferring and then export that into bytes :
After receiving all of the bytes from the sender , we can import the data back into a * WorldAnchorTransferBatch * and lock our root game object into the same physical location . Note : import will sometimes transiently fail and needs to be retried :

# Using reverb to add distance to spatial audio
In previous chapters , we added spatialization to sounds to give them a sense of direction . In this 5th chapter , we &apos;ll add a reverb effect to give sounds a sense of distance . Our objectives are to :
In this example , we &apos;ve named the new group &quot; Room Effect &quot; .
* Set the Dry Level property to the lowest setting ( -10000 mB )
* Set the Room property to the highest setting ( 0 mB )
The other settings control the feel of the simulated room . In particular , * * Decay Time * * is related to perceived room size .
The * * Room Effect Send Level * * component includes a graph control that sets the level of the audio sent to the Unity audio engine for reverb processing . Click and drag the curve downwards to set the level to about -30dB :
* Set the * * Room Effect Group * * property to your new Room Effect mixer group
* Set the * * Master Group * * property to the Master mixer group
You &apos;ve completed the HoloLens 2 spatial audio tutorials for Unity . Congratulations !

&#124; Holograms consistently appear stable . &#124; Secondary content exhibits unexpected movement ; or unexpected movement does not impede overall app experience . &#124; Primary content in frame exhibits unexpected movement . &#124;
* Use the stabilization plane .

# # Holograms position on real surfaces
* For the best precision , use markers or posters to set the holograms and an Xbox controller ( or some manual alignment mechanism ) for final calibration .
* Improperly set interpupillary distance ( IPD ) can also effect hologram alignment . Always configure HoloLens to the user &apos;s IPD .

# # Viewing zone of comfort
App developers control where users &apos; eyes converge by placing content and holograms at various depths . Users wearing HoloLens will always accommodate to 2.0m to maintain a clear image because HoloLens displays are fixed at an optical distance approximately 2.0m away from the user . Improper content depth can lead to visual discomfort or fatigue .
&lt; td &gt; Best &lt; / td &gt; &lt; td &gt; &lt; ul &gt;
* With few exceptions , the HoloLens clipping render distance should be set to .85CM with fadeout of content starting at 1m . Approach the content and note the clipping plane effect .
* Stationary content should not be closer than 50cm away .
* Design content for the optimal viewing distance of 2m .
* Set the clipping render distance to 85cm with fadeout of content starting at 1m .
* &#91; Focus point in Unity &#93; ( focus-point-in-unity.md )
* Keep primary content at a consistent focal plane and make sure the stabilization plane matches the focal plane . This will alleviate oculomotor fatigue and unexpected hologram movement .
* In general , relevant sounds should emit from target holograms ( eg . , bark sound coming from holographic dog . )
* Most sounds should be spatialized .
* Avoid invisible emitters .
* Avoid spatial masking .
* Normalize all sounds .

# # Focus on holographic frame ( FOV ) boundaries
* Context for a ( large ) hologram is lost or not understood due to being clipped at the boundaries .
* Start the experience with small objects that fit the FOV , then transition with visual cues to larger versions .
* As much as possible , avoid holograms that vertically clip the FOV .
* &#91; Scale of objects and environments &#93; ( scale.md )
# # Content reacts to user position
&lt; td &gt; Fail &lt; / td &gt; &lt; td &gt; &lt; ol &gt;
* For UI elements , relevant controls should be available regardless of user movement . For example , if the user is viewing and walking around a 3D map with zoom , the zoom control should be readily available to the user regardless of location .
* The user is the camera and they control the movement . Let them drive .
* Consider billboarding for text and menuing systems that would otherwise be world-locked or obscured if a user were to move around .
* &#91; Interaction design &#93; ( hologram.md )
* The app uses consistent &#91; standard input methods . &#93; ( interaction-fundamentals.md )
* If the app has custom input , it is clearly communicated through :
* Use standard input methods whenever possible .
* Provide demonstrations , tutorials , and tooltips for non-standard input methods .

&#124; Regardless of form , interactable objects are recognizable through visual and audio cues across three states : idle , targeted , and selected . &quot; See it , say it &quot; is clear and consistently used throughout the experience . Objects are scaled and distributed to allow for error free targeting . &#124; User can recognize object as interactable through audio or visual feedback , and can target and activate the object . &#124; Given no visual or audio cues , user cannot recognize an interactable object . Interactions are error prone due to object scale or distance between objects . &#124;
* Interactable objects are recognizable as &apos; interactable &apos; ; including buttons , menus , and app specific content . As a rule of thumb there should be a visual and audio cue when targeting interactable objects .
* Use visual and audio feedback for interactions .
* Visual feedback should be differentiated for each input state ( idle , targeted , selected )
* Interactable objects should be scaled and placed for error free targeting .
* Grouped interactable objects ( such as a menu bar or list ) should have proper spacing for targeting .

* * * Gamut * * - HoloLens benefits from a &quot; wide gamut &quot; of color , conceptually similar to Adobe RGB . As a result , some colors can exhibit different qualities and representation in the device .
Due to the nature of additive displays , dark colors appear transparent . A solid black object will appear no different from the real world . See Alpha channel below . To give the appearance of “ black ” try a very dark grey RGB value such as 16,16,16 .

After you have imported the tutorial assets your Project window should look similar to this :
# # Organizing 3D objects in a collection
In this section , you will create a panel of 3D objects which you will use when exploring various ways of interacting with 3D objects in the following sections of this tutorial . Specifically , you will configure the 3D objects to be positioned on a 3 x 3 grid .
1 . Parent the 3D objects to a parent object
&gt; For a reminder on how to do the steps listed above , you can refer to the &#91; Creating user interface and configure Mixed Reality Toolkit &#93; ( mrlearning-base-ch2.md ) tutorial .
Reposition the cubes so you can see each cube :

&gt; * * * Manipulation Handler ( Script ) * * component
&gt; * * * Near Interaction Grabbable ( Script ) * * component
# # # # Default manipulation
For the * * Cube * * object , leave all properties at default , to experience the default manipulation behavior :
&gt; To reset a component to its default values , you can select the component &apos;s Settings icon and select Reset .
For the * * Cube ( 1 ) * * object , change * * Two Handed Manipulation Type * * to * * Scale * * to only allow the user to change the object &apos;s size :
For the * * Cube ( 2 ) * * object , change * * Constraint On Movement * * to * * Fix Distance From Head * * so that when the object is moved , it stays at the same distance from the user :
# # # # Default grabbable manipulation
For the * * Cheese * * , * * CoffeCup * * , and * * EarthCore * * objects , leave all properties at default , to experience the default grabbable manipulation behavior :
# # # # Remove the ability of far manipulation
For the * * Octa * * object , un-check the * * Allow Far Manipulation * * checkbox to make it so the user can only interact with the object directly using tracked hands :
# # # # Make an object rotate around its center
For the * * Platonic * * object , change * * One Hand Rotation Mode Near * * and * * One Hand Rotation Mode Far * * to * * Rotate About Object Center * * to make it so when the user rotates the object with one hand , it rotates around the object &apos;s center :
# # # # Keep movement after object is released
Back on the Manipulation Handler ( Script ) component , verify that the * * Release Behavior * * is set to both * * Keep Velocity * * and * * Keep Angular Velocity * * so that once the object is released from the user &apos;s hand , it continues to move :
# # Adding bounding boxes
&gt; To be able to use a * * bounding box * * , the object must have the following components :
&gt; * * * Bounding Box ( Script ) * * component
In the Inspector window , select the * * EarthCore * * object and add the * * Bounding Box ( Script ) * * component to the EarthCore object :
&gt; The Bounding Box visualizations is created at run time and therefore not visible before you enter Game mode .
Press the Play button to enter Game mode . Then press and hold the spacebar to bring up the hand and use the mouse to interact with the bounding box :
# # Adding touch effects
1 . Add an Audio Source component to the object
2 . Add the Near Interaction Touchable ( Script ) component to the object
&gt; To be able to * * trigger touch events * * , the object must have the following components :
&gt; * * * Collider * * component , preferably a Box Collider
&gt; * * * Near Interaction Touchable ( Script ) * * component
&gt; * * * Hand Interaction Touch ( Script ) * * component
&gt; The Hand Interaction Touch ( Script ) component is not part of MRTK . It was imported with this tutorial &apos;s assets and originally part of the MixedReality Toolkit Unity Examples .
In the Hierarchy window , select the * * Octa * * object , add an * * Audio Source * * component to the Octa object , and then change * * Spatial Blend * * to 1 to enable spatial audio :
With the * * Octa * * object still selected , add the * * Hand Interaction Touch ( Script ) * * component to the Octa object :
Press the Play button to enter Game mode . Then press and hold the spacebar to bring up the hand and use the mouse to touch the Octa object and trigger the sound effect :
&gt; As you saw when testing the touch interaction , and as shown in the image above , the Octa object color pulsated while it was touched . This effect is hard coded into the Hand Interaction Touch ( Script ) component and not a result of the event configuration you completed in the steps above .
In this tutorial , you learned how to organize 3D objects in a grid collection and how to manipulate these objects ( scaling , rotating , and moving ) using near interaction ( directly grabbing with tracked hands ) and far interaction ( using gaze rays or hand rays ) . You also learned how to put bounding boxes around 3D objects , and learned how to use and customize the handles on the bounding boxes . Finally , you learned how to trigger events when touching an object .

# # # Specifying target and minimum version of Windows
You will be prompted to set target and minimum version of Windows when you create a new Universal Windows Project in Visual Studio . You can also change this setting for an existing project in the &quot; Project &quot; menu , then &quot; &lt; Your app name &apos;s &gt; Properties &quot; at the bottom of the drop-down menu .
Set minimum and target platform versions in Visual Studio
# # # Specifying target device families
To set this field in Visual Studio , right click on the Package.appxmanifest and select &quot; View Code &quot; then find the TargetDeviceFamily Name field . By default , it might look like the following :
From the Project menu in your Visual Studio solution , choose &quot; Store &gt; Associate App with the Store &quot; . If you do this , you can test purchase and notification scenarios in your app . When you associate your app with the Store , these values are downloaded to the app manifest file for the current project on your local machine :
# # # Creating an upload package
If there is a Windows.Universal package and a Windows.Holographic package and the Windows.Universal package has a higher version number , a HoloLens user will download the higher version number Windows.Universal package instead of the Windows.Holographic package . There are several solutions to this problem :
1 . Ensure your platform specific packages such as Windows.Holographic always have a higher version number than your platform agnostic packages such as Windows.Universal
2 . Do not package apps as Windows.Universal if you also have platform specific packages - instead package the Windows.Universal package for the specific platforms you want it available on
&gt; If you include both ARM and ARM64 in your package , the ARM64 version will be used on HoloLens 2 .
3 . Create a single Windows.Universal package that works across all platforms . Support for this isn &apos;t great right now so the above solutions are recommended .

If you selected &quot; PC &quot; above , you &apos;ll want to set the &quot; mixed reality setup &quot; ( activity level ) . This only applies to mixed reality experiences that run on PCs connected to immersive headsets , as mixed reality apps on HoloLens are world-scale and the user doesn &apos;t define a boundary during setup .
* Choose * * Seated + standing * * if your app is designed with the intention that the user stays in one position ( an example would be a game where you &apos;re seated in a cockpit of an aircraft ) .
* Choose * * All experiences * * if your app is designed with the intention that the user walks around within the boundary he or she defined during setup ( an example might be a game where you side-step and duck to dodge attacks ) .
# # # Mixed reality system requirements
In this section , you &apos;ll identify minimum ( required ) hardware and recommended ( optional ) hardware for your mixed reality app .
Be thoughtful about selecting checkboxes for &quot; minimum hardware &quot; or &quot; recommended hardware &quot; for input types .
If your app can * only * be used through an immersive headset , select the &quot; minimum hardware &quot; checkbox next to &quot; Windows Mixed Reality immersive headset . &quot; This will be surfaced on your app &apos;s product detail page in Store as a warning above the purchase button so customers don &apos;t think they &apos;re purchasing an app that will function on their PC like a traditional desktop app .
If your app runs on the desktop like a traditional PC app , but offers a VR experience when an immersive headset is connected ( whether the full content of your app is available , or only a portion ) , select the &quot; recommended hardware &quot; checkbox next to &quot; Windows Mixed Reality immersive headset . &quot; No warning will be surfaced above the purchase button on your app &apos;s product detail page if your app functions as a traditional desktop app without an immersive headset connected .
If your mixed reality app is designed to perform better , or offer higher-resolution graphics , on a particular PC configuration or graphics card , you should indicate that with the relevant PC specifications in the &quot; recommended hardware &quot; column .
This only applies if your mixed reality app uses an immersive headset connected to a PC . If your mixed reality app only runs on HoloLens , you won &apos;t need to indicate PC specifications as HoloLens has only one hardware configuration .

Obviously , there was more to creating this content than what we &apos;ve discussed here . There are a few scenes — we like to call them &quot; impossible perspectives &quot; — including the hot air balloon ride and the gladiator fight in the Colosseum , which took a more creative approach . We &apos;ll address these in a future case study .
# 3 . Displaying Azure Spatial Anchor feedback
In this tutorial , you will learn how to provide users with feedback about anchor discovery , events , and status when using Azure Spatial Anchors ( ASA ) .
* Learn how to set up a UI panel that displays important information about the current ASA session
* Understand and explore feedback elements that the ASA SDK makes available to users
# # Set up ASA feedback UI panel
With the * * Feedback * * object still selected , in the Inspector window change its position and size so it is placed neatly underneath the instruction text , for example :
* Change the Rect Transform * * Width * * to 0.555
* Change the Rect Transform * * Height * * to 0.1
Then choose font properties so the text fits nicely within the text area , for example :
With the * * Feedback * * object still selected , in the Inspector window , use the * * Add Component * * button to add the * * Anchor Feedback Script ( Script ) * * component to the Feedback object :
Assign the * * Feedback * * object itself to the * * Anchor Feedback Script ( Script ) * * component &apos;s * * Feedback Text * * field :
In this tutorial , you learned how to create a UI panel to display the current status of the Azure Spatial Anchor experience for providing users with real-time feedback .
In &#91; MR Basics 101 &#93; ( holograms-101.md ) , we used a simple air-tap gesture to interact with our holograms . Now , we &apos;ll move beyond the air-tap gesture and explore new concepts to :
* Some basic C # programming ability .
* You should have completed &#91; MR Basics 101 &#93; ( holograms-101.md ) .
# # # Errata and Notes
* &quot; Enable Just My Code &quot; needs to be disabled ( * unchecked * ) in Visual Studio under Tools- &gt; Options- &gt; Debugging in order to hit breakpoints in your code .
When Unity is done , a File Explorer window will appear .
If deploying to HoloLens :
&gt; You might notice some red errors in the Visual Studio Errors panel . It is safe to ignore them . Switch to the Output panel to view actual build progress . Errors in the Output panel will require you to make a fix ( most often they are caused by a mistake in a script ) .
# # Chapter 1 - Hand detected feedback
* Subscribe to hand tracking events .
&gt; On HoloLens 2 , hands detected fires whenever hands are visible ( not just when a finger is pointing up ) .
The * * InteractionInputSource.cs * * script performs these steps :
1 . Subscribes to the InteractionSourceDetected and InteractionSourceLost events .
Next , we &apos;ll upgrade our cursor from &#91; MR Input 210 &#93; ( holograms-210.md ) into one that shows feedback depending on the user &apos;s actions .
The * * Cursor State Data * * works like this :
* Any * * Observe * * state means that no hand is detected and the user is simply looking around .
* Any * * Interact * * state means that a hand or controller is detected .
* Any * * Hover * * state means the user is looking at a hologram .
# # # Build and Deploy
* ( If you already built / deployed this project in Visual Studio during set-up , then you can open that instance of VS and click &apos; Reload All &apos; when prompted ) .
* After the application deploys to the HoloLens , dismiss the fitbox using the air-tap gesture .
* Move your hand into view and point your index finger to the sky to start hand tracking .
* Move your hand left , right , up and down .
# # Chapter 2 - Navigation
* Use Navigation gesture events to rotate the astronaut .
Complete coding exercises 2.c in the script , or replace the code with the completed solution below :
You &apos;ll notice that the other navigation events are already filled in with some info . We push the GameObject onto the Toolkit &apos;s InputSystem &apos;s modal stack , so the user doesn &apos;t have to maintain focus on the Astronaut once rotation has begun . Correspondingly , we pop the GameObject off the stack once the gesture is completed .
2 . Gaze at the astronaut , two arrows should appear on either side of the cursor . This new visual indicates that the astronaut can be rotated .
3 . Place your hand in the ready position ( index finger pointed towards the sky ) so the HoloLens will start tracking your hand .
4 . To rotate the astronaut , lower your index finger to a pinch position , and then move your hand left or right to trigger the NavigationX gesture .
# # Chapter 3 - Hand Guidance
* Use * * hand guidance score * * to help predict when hand tracking will be lost .
* Provide * * feedback on the cursor * * to show when the user &apos;s hand nears the camera &apos;s edge of view .
* Rebuild the application in Unity and then build and deploy from Visual Studio to experience the app on HoloLens .
* Bring your hand into view and raise your index finger to get tracked .
* Start rotating the astronaut with the Navigation gesture ( pinch your index finger and thumb together ) .
* Move your hand far left , right , up , and down .
# # Chapter 4 - Manipulation
* Use Manipulation events to move the astronaut with your hands .
GestureManager.cs and AstronautManager.cs will allow us to do the following :
We &apos;ll now add the speech commands required to control the interaction state of the astronaut .
Next , we &apos;ll setup the manipulation feedback on the cursor .
Complete coding exercise 4.a in * * GestureAction.cs * * , or use our completed solution below :
* Rebuild in Unity and then build and deploy from Visual Studio to run the app in HoloLens .
* Move your hand in front of the HoloLens and raise your index finger so that it can be tracked .
* Focus the cursor over the astronaut .
* Say &apos; Move Astronaut &apos; to move the astronaut with a Manipulation gesture .
* Lower your index finger down to your thumb , and keep them pinched together .
* As you move your hand around , the astronaut will move too ( this is Manipulation ) .
* Raise your index finger to stop manipulating the astronaut .
* Note : If you do not say &apos; Move Astronaut &apos; before moving your hand , then the Navigation gesture will be used instead .
* Say &apos; Rotate Astronaut &apos; to return to the rotatable state .

* Learn about the SurfaceObserver and how its settings impact experience and performance .
* Create a room scanning experience to collect the meshes of your room .
* * Build and Deploy ( part 1 ) * *
* Press the * * Select Folder * * button .
* Double-click on the * * App * * folder to open it .
* Click on the drop-down arrow to the right of &apos; Local Machine &apos; , and select * * Remote Machine * * .
* Scan your surroundings . Be sure to look at walls , ceilings , and floors .
* * Build and Deploy ( part 2 ) * *
Now let &apos;s explore how Spatial Mapping can affect performance .
* Observe the number of milliseconds it takes for the GPU to render a frame .
* Re-deploy the project to your device , and then * * reconnect the profiler * * . Observe the change in the number of milliseconds to render a frame .
Finally , let &apos;s save our room mesh and load it into Unity .
* Watch as the areas that you have scanned on your HoloLens appear in the display window .
* To save your room scan , press the * * Save * * button .
* Locate the * * Object Surface Observer ( Script ) * * component .
* Click the circle to the right of the * * Room Model * * property .
* The SpatialMapping component will load the meshes from the saved room model so you can use them in Unity .
* Switch to * * Scene * * view to see all of your room model displayed with the wireframe shader .
* Press the * * Play * * button again to exit preview mode .
* * NOTE : * * The next time that you enter preview mode in Unity , it will load the saved room mesh by default .
# # Chapter 2 - Visualization
* Learn the basics of shaders .
* Visualize your surroundings .
* Click the circle to the right of the * * Surface Material * * property .
* This is a simple pixel ( vertex to fragment ) shader , which accomplishes the following tasks :
1 . Converts a vertex &apos;s location to world space .
2 . Checks the vertex &apos;s normal to determine if a pixel is vertical .
3 . Sets the color of the pixel for rendering .
* Modify some properties and see how the changes appear in the Unity editor .
* Click * * Play * * again to exit preview mode .
* Build and deploy to the HoloLens and observe how the shader rendering appears on real surfaces .
# # Chapter 3 - Processing
* Use planes for hologram placement .
1 . Stop collecting spatial mapping data after we exceed the scanning time limit ( 10 seconds ) .
2 . Process the spatial mapping data :
1 . Use SurfaceMeshesToPlanes to create a simpler representation of the world as planes ( walls , floors , ceilings , etc ) .
2 . Use RemoveSurfaceVertices to remove surface triangles that fall within plane boundaries .
* When processing is complete , planes will appear to represent the floor , walls , ceiling , etc .
* Press the * * Play * * button again to exit play mode .
* Build and deploy to the HoloLens , as usual .
# # Chapter 4 - Placement
The * * Placeable * * script is already attached to the posters and projection box that are created after plane finding completes . All we need to do is uncomment some code , and this script will achieve the following :
3 . Render a bounding cube around the hologram to show its actual size while being placed .
4 . Cast a shadow under / behind the hologram to show where it will be placed on the floor / wall .
5 . Render the shadow as red , if the hologram cannot be placed on the surface , or green , if it can .
7 . Smoothly place the hologram on the selected surface to avoid jumping or snapping behavior .
Uncomment all code in the coding exercise below , or use this completed solution in * * Placeable.cs * * :
* As before , build the project and deploy to the HoloLens .
* When you see the solar system , gaze at the projection box below and perform a select gesture to move it around . While the projection box is selected , a bounding cube will be visible around the projection box .
First , we are going to allow the spatial mapping mesh to occlude other holograms without occluding the real world :
* Click the circle to the right of the * * Secondary Material * * property .
* Find and select the * * Occlusion * * material and close the window .
1 . Determine if a planet is occluded by the SpatialMapping layer ( room meshes and planes ) .
2 . Show the wireframe representation of a planet whenever it is occluded by the SpatialMapping layer .
Follow the coding exercise in PlanetOcclusion.cs , or use the following solution :
* Build and deploy the application to HoloLens , as usual .
* Find and select the solar system &apos;s projection box and then set the box next to a wall or behind a counter .
* You can view basic occlusion by hiding behind surfaces to peer at the poster or projection box .
* Watch as the planets move behind the wall or other surfaces in the room . You now have x-ray vision and can see their wireframe skeletons !
* You experienced different occlusion techniques and harnessed the power of x-ray vision !

With Holographic Remoting , you can experience your app on the HoloLens , while it runs in the Unity editor on your PC . Gaze , gesture , voice , and spatial mapping input is sent from your HoloLens to your PC . Rendered frames are then sent back to your HoloLens . This is a great way to quickly debug your app without building and deploying a full project .
Holographic Remoting requires a fast PC and Wi-Fi connection . See &#91; Holographic Remoting Player &#93; ( holographic-remoting-player.md ) for full details .
For best results , make sure your app properly sets the &#91; focus point &#93; ( focus-point-in-unity.md ) . This helps Holographic Remoting to best adapt your scene to the latency of your wireless connection .

# 1 . Getting started
Make sure you &apos;ve met the following requirements before jumping in :
* Visual Studio 2019 with the workloads below
The last step is to setup Visual Studio as follows :
* .NET desktop development
* Universal Windows Platform development
That &apos;s it ! You &apos;re all set to move on to starting the chess app project .
&#91; Next section : 2 . Initializing your project and first application &#93; ( unreal-uxt-ch2.md )
# # What is billboarding ?
# # What is a tag-along ?
* The HoloLens Start menu is a great example of tag-along behavior *
# # Billboarding and Tag-along in MRTK ( Mixed Reality Toolkit ) for Unity
title : Coordinate systems in Unity
# # Building an orientation-only or seated-scale experience
# # Building a standing-scale or room-scale experience
To ensure that Unity is operating with its world coordinate system at floor-level , you can set Unity to the RoomScale tracking space type , and ensure that the set succeeds :
# # Building a world-scale experience
# # # Adding a World Anchor
That &apos;s it ! This game object will now be anchored to its current location in the physical world - you may see its Unity world coordinates adjust slightly over time to ensure that physical alignment . Use &#91; persistence &#93; ( persistence-in-unity.md ) to find this anchored location again in a future app session .
# # # Removing a World Anchor
If you want to move the GameObject this frame , you need to call DestroyImmediate instead .
GameObject &apos;s cannot be moved while a World Anchor is on it . If you need to move the GameObject this frame , you need to :
1 . DestroyImmediate the World Anchor component
3 . Add a new World Anchor component to the GameObject .
# # # Handling Locatability Changes
To be notified about locatability changes :
1 . Subscribe to the OnTrackingChanged event
2 . Handle the event
The * * OnTrackingChanged * * event will be called whenever the underlying spatial anchor changes between a state of being locatable vs. not being locatable .
* &#91; Tracking loss in Unity &#93; ( tracking-loss-in-unity.md )
* &#91; Shared experiences in Unity &#93; ( shared-experiences-in-unity.md )
Surfaces demonstrates how to use Mixed Reality Toolkit ( MRTK ) &apos; s input system and building blocks to create an app experience for HoloLens 2 . In this project , you can find the examples of :
( The app is only available on HoloLens 2 )
# 1 . Integrating and using speech recognition and transcription
* Learn how to integrate Azure Speech Services with a HoloLens 2 application
&gt; If you have not completed the &#91; Getting started tutorials &#93; ( mrlearning-base.md ) series yet , it &apos;s recommended that you complete those tutorials first .
In this section , you will create a new Unity project and get it ready for MRTK development .
# # Configuring the speech commands start behavior
Because you will use the Speech SDK for speech recognition and transcription you need to configure the MRTK Speech Commands so they do not interfere with the Speech SDK functionality . To achieve this you can change the speech commands start behavior from Auto Start to Manual Start .
With the * * MixedRealityToolkit * * object selected in the Hierarchy window , in the Inspector window , select the * * Input * * tab , clone the * * DefaultHoloLens2InputSystemProfile * * and the * * DefaultMixedRealitySpeechCommandsProfile * * , and then change the speech commands * * Start Behavior * * to * * Manual Start * * :
# # Configuring the capabilities
In the Unity menu , select * * Edit * * &gt; * * Project Settings ... * * to open the Player Settings window , then locate the * * Player * * &gt; * * Publishing Settings * * section :
In the * * Publishing Settings * * , scroll down to the * * Capabilities * * section and double-check that the * * InternetClient * * , * * Microphone * * , and * * SpatialPerception * * capabilities , which you enabled when you created the project at the beginning of the tutorial , are enabled . Then , enable the * * InternetClientServer * * and * * PrivateNetworkClientServer * * capabilities :
In this section , you will prepare the scene by adding the tutorial prefab and configure the Lunarcom Controller ( Script ) component to control your scene .
In the Project window , navigate to * * Assets * * &gt; * * MRTK.Tutorials.AzureSpeechServices * * &gt; * * Prefabs * * folder and drag the * * Lunarcom * * prefab into the Hierarchy window to add it to your scene :
With the * * Lunarcom * * object still selected in the Hierarchy window , in the Inspector window , use the * * Add Component * * button to add the * * Lunarcom Controller ( Script ) * * component to the Lunarcom object :
&gt; The Lunarcom Controller ( Script ) component is not part of MRTK . It was provided with this tutorial &apos;s assets .
# # Connecting the Unity project to the Azure resource
In the Hierarchy window , select the * * Lunarcom * * object , then in the Inspector window , locate the * * Lunarcom Controller ( Script ) * * component &apos;s * * Speech SDK Credentials * * section and configure it as follows :
* In the * * Speech Service API Key * * field , enter your API key ( Key1 or Key2 )
* In the * * Speech Service Region * * field , enter your service region ( Location ) using lowercase letters and spaces removed
In the Hierarchy window , select the * * Lunarcom * * object , then in the Inspector window , use the * * Add Component * * button to add the * * Lunarcom Speech Recognizer ( Script ) * * component to the Lunarcom object :
&gt; The Lunarcom Speech Recognizer ( Script ) component is not part of MRTK . It was provided with this tutorial &apos;s assets .
If you now enter Game mode , you can test the speech recognition by first pressing the microphone button :
You have implemented speech recognition powered by Azure . Run the application on your device to ensure the feature is working properly .

# # Windows Mixed Reality logo
# # FAQs and troubleshooting
&#91; Getting a HolographicSpace &#93; ( getting-a-holographicspace.md ) is what every Mixed Reality app does before it starts receiving camera data and rendering frames . In Unity , the engine takes care of those steps for you , handling Holographic objects and updates internally as part of its render loop .
You can convert it to HolographicFrameNativeData using Marshal.PtrToStructure method :
# # # Unmarshaling native pointers
Otherwise , use `Marshal.GetObjectForIUnknown ( ) ` and cast to the desired type :
# # # Converting between coordinate systems
Unity uses a left-handed coordinate system , while the Windows Perception APIs use right-handed coordinate systems . To convert between these two conventions , you can use the following helpers :

title : Create 3D models for use in the home
# Create 3D models for use in the home
When creating 3D models for Windows Mixed Reality there are some requirements that all assets must meet :
The rest of this article includes a detailed overview of these requirements as well as additional guidelines to ensure your models work well with the Windows Mixed Reality home .
1 . The Up axis should be set to “ Y ” .
2 . The asset should face “ forward ” towards the positive Z axis .
3 . All assets should be built on the ground plane at the scene origin ( 0,0,0 )
7 . UVs must be laid out in a square arrangement in the 0-1 space . Avoid tiling textures although they are permitted .
8 . Multi-UVs are not supported
9 . Double sided materials are not supported
&#124; LOD Level &#124; Recommended Triangle Count &#124; Max Triangle Count &#124;
# # # Node counts and submesh limits
&#124; Recommended Texture Size &#124; Max Texture Size &#124; Lowest Mip
&#124; 512x512 &#124; 4096x4096 &#124; max 4x4 &#124;
# # # Albedo ( base color ) map
Raw color with no lighting information . This map also contains the reflectance and diffuse information for metal ( white in the metallic map ) and insulator ( black in the metallic map ) surfaces respectively .
Describes the microsurface of the object . White 1.0 is rough Black 0.0 is smooth . This map gives the asset the most character as it truly describes the surface e.g. scratches , fingerprints , smudges , grime etc .
Value scale map depicting areas of occluded light which blocks reflections
Tells the shader if something is metal or not . Raw Metal = 1.0 white Non metal = 0.0 black . There can be transitional gray values that indicate something covering the raw metal such as dirt , but in general this map should be black and white only .
&#124; glTF Property &#124; Texture &#124; Packing Scheme &#124;
When compressing the DDS textures the following compression is expected on each map :
&#124; Texture &#124; Expected Compression &#124;
# # # # Immersive ( VR ) headsets
PC-based Windows Mixed Reality experiences for immersive ( VR ) headsets expect textures to be packed using a 3-texture setup using the following packing specification :
# # # Adding mesh LODs
&#124; LOD Level &#124; Recommended Range &#124; Default Range &#124;
&#124; LOD 4 &#124; Under 1 % &#124; - &#124;
First , download the following tools if you don &apos;t have them already . These tools will make it easy to open any glTF model , preview it , make changes and save back out as glTF or .glb :
# # # Opening and previewing the model
# # # Adding the triggers
The following animation triggers semantics are supported by the Windows Mixed Reality home .
* &quot; ALWAYS &quot; : Constantly loop an animation
* &quot; HELD &quot; : Looped during the entire duration an object is grabbed .
* &quot; GAZE &quot; : Looped while an object is being looked at
* &quot; PROXIMITY &quot; : Looped while a viewer is near to an object
* &quot; POINTING &quot; : Looped while a user is pointing at an object

title : Mixed reality news
We have a friendly astronaut here to help you learn gaze concepts . In &#91; MR Basics 101 &#93; ( holograms-101.md ) , we had a simple cursor that just followed your gaze . Today we &apos;re moving a step beyond the simple cursor :
* We &apos;re making the cursor and our holograms gaze-aware : both will change based on where the user is looking - or where the user is * not * looking . This makes them context-aware .
* In Visual Studio , &quot; Just My Code &quot; needs to be disabled ( unchecked ) under Tools- &gt; Options- &gt; Debugging in order to hit breakpoints in your code .
# # Chapter 1 - Unity Setup
* Optimize Unity for HoloLens development .
* Import assets and setup the scene .
* View the astronaut in the HoloLens .
5 . Make sure the project is set to * * 3D * * .
6 . Click * * Create Project * * .
# # # Unity settings for HoloLens
We need to let Unity know that the app we are trying to export should create an &#91; immersive view &#93; ( app-views.md ) instead of a 2D view . We do that by adding HoloLens as a virtual reality device .
Next , we need to set our scripting backend to .NET .
Finally , we &apos;ll update our quality settings to achieve a fast performance on HoloLens .
# # Chapter 2 - Cursor and target feedback
* Cursor visual design and behavior .
* Gaze-based cursor feedback .
* Gaze-based hologram feedback .
* The cursor is always present .
* Avoid obstructing content .
1 . As before , build the project and deploy to the HoloLens .
# # Chapter 3 - Targeting Techniques
* Make it easier to target holograms .
* Stabilize natural head movements .
* This script iterates over samples of Raycast data and helps stabilize the user &apos;s gaze for precision targeting .
# # Chapter 4 - Directional indicator
We &apos;re going to use the * * DirectionIndicator.cs * * file which will :
1 . Show the directional indicator if the user is not gazing at the holograms .
3 . Update the directional indicator to point to the holograms .
7 . Build and deploy the app .
8 . Watch how the directional indicator object helps you find the astronaut .
# # Chapter 5 - Billboarding
* Use billboarding to have holograms always face towards you .
5 . Try it ! Build and deploy the app as before .
# # Chapter 6 - Tag-Along
* Use Tag-Along to have our holograms follow us around the room .
* Content should always be a glance away .
* Content should not be in the way .
* Head-locking content is uncomfortable .
The solution used here is to use a &quot; tag-along &quot; approach .
We &apos;re going to use the * * SimpleTagalong.cs * * file which will :
2 . If not within the view frustum , position the Tag-Along to partially within the view frustum .
3 . Otherwise , position the Tag-Along to a default distance from the user .
* Complete the coding exercise or change it to this :
* Add functionality to the PerformAction function in the TagalongAction script ( inherited from InteractibleAction ) .
* Add billboarding to the gazed-upon object , and set the pivot axis to XY .
* Then add simple Tag-Along to the object .
* Try it ! Build and deploy the app .

# # Chapter 3 - Gestures
* Control your holograms with the Select gesture .
* Open the script in Visual Studio for editing , and replace the default code with this :
* Look around the scene , and center on one of the spheres .
# # Chapter 4 - Voice
In this chapter , we &apos;ll add support for two &#91; voice commands &#93; ( voice-input.md ) : &quot; Reset world &quot; to returns the dropped spheres to their original location , and &quot; Drop sphere &quot; to make the sphere fall .
* Update the script to read as follows :
* The emulator will support your PC &apos;s microphone and respond to your voice : adjust the view so the cursor is on one of the spheres , and say &quot; Drop Sphere &quot; .
* Say &quot; * * Reset World * * &quot; to bring them back to their initial positions .
# # Chapter 5 - Spatial sound
In this chapter , we &apos;ll add music to the app , and then trigger sound effects on certain actions . We &apos;ll be using &#91; spatial sound &#93; ( spatial-sound.md ) to give sounds a specific location in 3D space .
* Hear holograms in your world .
* Check the * * Play On Awake * * .
* Save the script , and return to Unity .
# # Chapter 6 - Spatial mapping
Now we are going to use &#91; spatial mapping &#93; ( spatial-mapping.md ) to place the game board on a real object in the real world .
* Click on the * * Holograms * * folder in the Project panel .
* Click on the * * Spatial Mapping * * object in the Hierarchy .
* In the * * Inspector panel * * , change the following properties :
* Check the * * Draw Visual Meshes * * box .
Now we &apos;ll show you how to move the OrigamiCollection to a new location :

# # # Galaxy Explorer : Stationary content , 3D interactivity
In HoloStudio , you spend most of your time looking at the same model you ’ re working on . Your gaze doesn ’ t move a significant amount , except for when you select a new tool or want to navigate the UI , so we can keep the plane setting logic simple . When looking at the UI , the plane is set to whatever UI element your gaze snaps to . When looking at the model , the plane is a set distance away , corresponding with the default distance between you and the model .

# MR Spatial 220 : Spatial sound
* Configure your development environment to use Microsoft Spatial Sound .
* Use Spatial Sound to enhance interactions .
* Use Spatial Sound in conjunction with &#91; Spatial Mapping &#93; ( spatial-mapping.md ) .
* Understand sound design and mixing best practices .
* Change Unity &apos;s sound configuration to use Microsoft Spatial Sound .
* Add 3D sound to an object in Unity .
* Wait for the project to load in Unity .
By default , Unity does not load a spatializer plugin . The following steps will enable Spatial Sound in the project .
We will now build the project in Unity and configure the solution in Visual Studio .
# # Chapter 2 - Spatial Sound and Interaction
* Direct the user &apos;s gaze using sound .
* Provide gesture feedback using sound .
# # # Part 1 - Enhancing Realism
# # # # Key Concepts
* Spatialize hologram sounds .
The following instructions will attach a spatialized sound to a hologram .
Setting Doppler level to zero disables changes in pitch caused by motion ( either of the hologram or the user ) . A classic example of Doppler is a fast-moving car . As the car approaches a stationary listener , the pitch of the engine rises . When it passes the listener , the pitch lowers with distance .
* The brain has some learned expectations .
# # # Part 3 - Gesture Feedback
* Double click on &quot; GestureSoundHandler &quot; to load in Visual Studio .
# # # # Build and Deploy
Check that the Toolbar says &quot; Release &quot; , &quot; x86 &quot; or &quot; x64 &quot; , and &quot; Remote Device &quot; . If not , this is the coding instance of Visual Studio . You may need to re-open the solution from the App folder .
* If prompted , reload the project files .
* As before , deploy from Visual Studio .
* Observe how the sound changes as you move around P0LY .
* Say * &quot; Go Hide &quot; * to make P0LY move to a location behind you . Find it by the sound .
# # Chapter 3 - Spatial Sound and Spatial Mapping
* Occlude sound using the physical world .
# # # Part 1 - Physical World Interaction
* Physical objects generally make a sound when encountering a surface or another object .
* In * * Tap To Place With Sound and Action * * :
* Check * * Place Parent On Tap * * .
# # # Part 2 - Sound Occlusion
* Sound , like light , can be occluded .
This setting limits the AudioSource frequencies to 1500 Hz and below .
Audio Occluder implements IAudioInfluencer to :
* Applies volume attenuation to the AudioSource .
* As before , build the project in Unity and deploy in Visual Studio .
* Say * &quot; Go Charge &quot; * to have P0LY enter the Energy Hub .
Note that the sound occlusion is removed once P0LY exits the Energy Hub . If you are still hearing occlusion , P0LY may be occluded by the real world . Try moving to ensure you have a clear line of sight to P0LY .
# # # Part 3 - Room Models
* The size of the space provides subliminal queues that contribute to sound localization .
# # Chapter 4 - Sound Design
* Understand considerations for effective sound design .
* Learn mixing techniques and guidelines .
# # # Part 1 - Sound and Experience Design
This section discusses key sound and experience design considerations and guidelines .
# # # # Normalize all sounds
# # # # Design for an untethered experience
# # # # Emit sound from logical locations on your holograms
# # # # Familiar sounds are most localizable
# # # # Be cognizant of user expectations
# # # # Avoid hidden emitters
# # # Part 2 - Sound Mixing
# # # # Mix sounds based on the user &apos;s gaze
# # # # Building your mix
Voice overs are an interesting scenario . Based on the experience you are creating you may wish to have a stereo ( not localized ) sound or to spatialize your voice overs . Two Microsoft published experiences illustrate excellent examples of each scenario .
# # # Part 3 -Performance
When using Spatial Sound , 10 - 12 emitters will consume approximately 12 % of the CPU .
# # # # Stream long audio files
Audio data can be large , especially at common sample rates ( 44.1 and 48 kHz ) . A general rule is that audio files longer than 5 - 10 seconds should be streamed to reduce application memory usage .
In Unity , you can mark an audio file for streaming in the file &apos;s import settings .

# Voice input in DirectX
From * HolographicVoiceInputSampleMain.cpp * :
# # Use &quot; one-shot &quot; recognition
1 . Your app creates the SpeechRecognizer , provides UI prompts , and starts listening for a spoken command .
2 . The user speaks a phrase or sentence .
The following code compiles the topic constraint , which in this case is optimized for web search .
If compilation succeeds , we can proceed with speech recognition .
* To optimize for dictation , use the dictation scenario . &lt; br / &gt;
* For speech web searches , use the following web-specific scenario constraint .
* You can provide your own grammar in the SRGS format .
If you &apos;re not using ref classes to create your DirectX app , you must unsubscribe from the event before you release or recreate your speech recognizer . The HolographicSpeechPromptSample has a routine to stop recognition and unsubscribe from events .
# # Use speech synthesis to provide audible prompts
Speech is synthesized asynchronously through SynthesizeTextToStreamAsync . Here , we start an async task to synthesize the speech .
As with speech recognition , speech synthesis throws an exception if something goes wrong .
# Using Vuforia Engine with Unity
# # Get the tools
When installing Unity , be sure to install the “ Windows Store IL2CPP Scripting Backend ” .
Adding Vuforia Engine Support works differently depending on your version of Unity :
# # Getting started with Vuforia Engine
3 . Add the sample scenes to Scenes in Build .
4 . Set your platform build target for “ Universal Windows Platform ” in File &gt; Build Settings .
5 . Select the following platform build configuration settings :
* Build and Run on = Local Machine
9 . Check the following Capabilities in Player Settings &gt; Publish Settings
* SpatialPerception - if you intend to use the Surface Observer API
10 . Select Build to generate a Visual Studio project
11 . Build the executable from Visual Studio and install it on your HoloLens
Note : Starting with version 7.2 , the Vuforia Engine Sample for HoloLens includes a sample scene including example usage of Model Targets
# # The Vuforia Developer Portal
# # Extended tracking with Vuforia
* * The following is a high-level description of the process : * *
2 . Target tracking is then initialized
3 . The position and rotation of the target are analyzed to provide a robust pose estimate for HoloLens
4 . Vuforia Engine transforms the target &apos;s pose into the HoloLens spatial mapping coordinate space
5 . HoloLens takes over tracking if the target is no longer in view . Whenever you look again at the target , Vuforia will continue to track the images and objects accurately .
# # Performance Mode with Vuforia Engine
It is possible through the Vuforia Engine to manage the performance on the HoloLens to extent AR experiences and reduce the workload on the CPU . The Vuforia Engine offers three modes that can be selected : default , for optimizing speed , and for optimizing quality .
* MODE _ DEFAULT is the normal mode which can be used in most scenarios .
* Select the dropdown menu for Camera Device Mode and select one of the three options .
* &#91; Camera in Unity &#93; ( camera-in-unity.md )
# # # Create clear hierarchy
* Define your type ramp and follow it throughout the app experience *
Avoid using light or semilight font weights for type sizes under 42pt since thin vertical strokes will vibrate and degrade legibility . Modern fonts with enough stroke thickness work well . For example , Helvetica and Arial are very legible in HoloLens using regular or bold weights .
To use dark text , you should use a bright back plate to make it readable . In additive color systems , black is displayed as transparent . This means you will not be able to see the black text without a colored back plate .
* Examples of white on black and black on white text * &lt; br &gt;
* Examples of black text in the system apps - Store and Settings * &lt; br &gt;

To add an OpenXR.Loader NuGet package reference to your Visual Studio C + + solution :
1 . Click OK to accept the changes to your project .
# # # Include official OpenXR loader source
If you want to build the loader yourself , for example to avoid the extra loader .DLL , you can pull the official Khronos OpenXR loader sources into your project . This will give you access to OpenXR 1.0 core features , plus published `KHR` , `EXT` and `MSFT` extensions .
# # Using preview extensions
If you &apos;re interested to try out the available `MSFT _ preview` extensions , go through the following steps to update your project :
1 . Follow either of the approaches above to integrate an OpenXR loader into your project .
To then activate preview extension support on your target HoloLens 2 or desktop PC :

# # # Voice Command Design
* Create concise commands . You don &apos;t want to use * &quot; Play the currently selected video &quot; * , because that command is not concise and would easily be forgotten by the user . Instead , you should use : * &quot; Play Video &quot; * , because it is concise and has multiple syllables .
# # # # DON &apos;T
* Use single syllable commands . As an example , if you were creating a voice command to play a video , you should avoid using the simple command * &quot; Play &quot; * , as it is only a single syllable and could easily be missed by the system . Instead , you should use : * &quot; Play Video &quot; * , because it is concise and has multiple syllables .

# Mixed reality capture for developers
# # The importance of quality MRC
# # How MRC impacts your app
# # # # Set the focus point
If a focus point is not set , the stabilization plane will default to two meters .
# # # # Render from the PV camera ( opt-in )
Render from the PV camera offers the following improvements over the default MRC experience :
There are three steps to enable rendering from the PV camera :
2 . Handle the additional HolographicCamera render
3 . Verify your shaders and code render correctly from this additional HolographicCamera
1 . HolographicSpace &apos;s CameraAdded event will fire . This event can be deferred if the app cannot handle the camera at this time .
When mixed reality capture stops ( or if the app disables the view configuration while mixed reality capture is running ) : the HolographicCamera will appear in the next HolographicFrame &apos;s RemovedCameras list and the HolographicSpace &apos;s CameraRemoved event will fire .
This is done for you automatically by Unity .
To opt-in to rendering from the PV Camera :
This is done for you automatically by Unreal .
# # # # # Verify shaders and code support additional cameras

Start by declaring a new OnPointerPressed handler in AppView.h :
In AppView.cpp , add this code to SetWindow :
Now , in the Update method , replace the existing logic for getting a pointer pose with this :

Looking back at the original control scheme , * * we needed to solve for thrust and rotation * * . The caveat is rotation in the new context adds an additional axis ( technically two , but the Y axis is less important for landing ) . The two distinct ship movements naturally lend themselves to be mapped to each hand :

title : Coordinate systems
&#124; Experience scale &#124; Requirements &#124; Example experience &#124;
These experience scales follow a &quot; nesting dolls &quot; model . The key design principle here for Windows Mixed Reality is that a given headset supports apps built for a target experience scale , as well as all lesser scales :
&#124; 6DOF tracking &#124; Floor defined &#124; 360 ° tracking &#124; Bounds defined &#124; Spatial anchors &#124; Max experience &#124;
In general , Cartesian coordinate systems can be either right-handed or left-handed . Spatial coordinate systems on Windows are always right-handed , which means that the positive X-axis points right , the positive Y-axis points up ( aligned to gravity ) and the positive Z-axis points towards you .
# # # Stationary frame of reference
# # # Attached frame of reference
# # # Stage frame of reference
# # # Spatial anchor persistence
# # # Spatial anchor sharing
We strongly discourage rendering head-locked content , which stays at a fixed spot in the display ( such as a HUD ) . In general , head-locked content is uncomfortable for users and does not feel like a natural part of their world .
Head-locked content should usually be replaced with holograms that are attached to the user or placed in the world itself . For example , &#91; cursors &#93; ( cursors.md ) should generally be pushed out into the world , scaling naturally to reflect the position and distance of the object under the user &apos;s gaze .

title : Establishing a secure connection with Holographic Remoting
# Establishing a secure connection with Holographic Remoting
When streaming content to HoloLens 2 over a insecure Network such as an open WiFi or the internet it is highly recommended to use an encrypted connection .
&gt; Even when using a trusted local WiFi using an encrypted connection should be considered .
The encryption is achieved by using the underlying platforms TLS implementation .
# # Basics of an encrypted connection
1 ) A certificate object , which needs to implement the ```ICertificate``` interface .
* Return the binary contents of the pfx certificate through the ```GetCertificatePfx``` method . Same as the binary contents of a .pfx file .
* Return the certificate subject name through ```GetSubjectName``` .
* Return the pfx password through ```GetPfxPassword``` . Return an empty string for an unprotected pfx .
2 ) A certificate provider implementing the ```ICertificateProvider``` interface which provides a certificate when asked through the ```GetCertificate``` method .
3 ) A certificate validator implementing the ```ICertificateValidator``` interface . Its task is to verify incoming certificates .
* The ```PerformSystemValidation``` method should return ```true``` when the underlying platform should validate the incoming certificate chain , ```false``` otherwise .
1 ) An authentication provider implementing the ```IAuthenticationProvider``` interface . Its ```GetToken``` method is called by the client context to request a token for client authentication . To continue either ```TokenReceived``` to provide the authentication token and continue the connection process or ```Cancel``` to cancel the process needs to be called on the passed ```IAuthenticationProviderCallback``` .
2 ) An authentication receiver implementing the ```IAuthenticationReceiver``` interface . Its task is to validate incoming tokens .
* The ```ValidateToken``` method is called by the server network context to request validation of a client authentication token . To continue either call ```ValidationCompleted``` to signal completion of the validation or ```Cancel``` to reject the client connection .. The client connection will be admitted or rejected based on the validation result passed to ```ValidationCompleted``` .
Once these objects are implemented ```ListenSecure``` needs to be called instead of ```Listen``` and ```ConnectSecure``` instead of ```Connect``` on the remote context and player context respectively . ```ListenSecure``` requires an additional certificate provider and authentication receiver over ```Listen``` . ```ConnectSecure``` requires an additional authentication provider and certificate validator over ```Connect``` .

# # Locating the Device Camera in the World
&quot; Camera &quot; elsewhere in HoloLens documentation may refer to the &quot; virtual game camera &quot; ( the frustum the app renders to ) . Unless denoted otherwise , &quot; camera &quot; on this page refers to the real-world RGB color camera .
# # # Using Media Foundation
On HoloLens , the video and still image streams are undistorted in the system &apos;s image processing pipeline before the frames are made available to the application ( the preview stream contains the original distorted frames ) . Because only the CameraIntrinsics are made available , applications must assume image frames represent a perfect pinhole camera .
The Device Camera frames come with a &quot; Camera To World &quot; transform , that can be used to show exactly where the device was when the image was taken . For example , you could position a small holographic icon at this location ( CameraToWorld.MultiplyPoint ( Vector3.zero ) ) and even draw a little arrow in the direction that the camera was facing ( CameraToWorld.MultiplyVector ( Vector3.forward ) ) .
2 . Collect image frames at runtime , and pass them to the recognition layer
1 . Main Thread : manages the camera object
2 . Main Thread : requests new frames ( async )

title : Volume rendering
1 . BAD : Naïve Approach : Show Whole Volume , generally runs too slowly
2 . GOOD : Cutting Plane : Show only a single slice of the volume
3 . GOOD : Cutting Sub-Volume : Show only a few layers of the volume
4 . GOOD : Lower the resolution of the volume rendering ( see &apos; Mixed Resolution Scene Rendering &apos; )
* Screen-Width * Screen-Height * Screen-Count * Volume-Layers-On-That-Pixel = Total-Volume-Samples-Per-Frame
# # Representing 3D Textures
On the GPU :
# # Shading and Gradients
How to shade a volume , such as MRI , for useful visualization . The primary method is to have an &apos; intensity window &apos; ( a min and max ) that you want to see intensities within , and simply scale into that space to see the black and white intensity . A &apos; color ramp &apos; can then be applied to the values within that range , and stored as a texture , so that different parts of the intensity spectrum can be shaded different colors :
How to use the GPU to do sub-volume tracing ( walks a few voxels deep , then layers on the data from back to front ) :
# # Whole Volume Rendering
Modifying the sub-volume code above , we get :
2 . Setup two low-resolution render targets ( i.e. 200x200 each ) that the cameras render into
1 . Draw the render targets for each eye at low-resolution ( volume data , expensive shaders , etc . )
2 . Draw the scene normally as full resolution ( meshes , UI , etc . )
4 . Result : visual combination of full-resolution elements with low-resolution but high-density volume data

# # What is mixed reality ?
Internally at Microsoft , we are creating mixed reality applications to empower employees and optimize operations . The Dynamics 365 team has worked on a range of projects that demonstrate the possibilities : Remote Assist , Layout and Guides .
# # See how industry partners are using mixed reality
Synchro is digital construction software that enables viewing complex construction projects in mixed reality . Their 4D digital construction platform combines traditional Gantt chart CPM scheduling with integrated 4D visualization capabilities in real time .
Philips is piloting HoloLens in the domain of image-guided minimally invasive procedures , during which physicians rely on live X-ray , ultrasound and other sources of information to &quot; see &quot; inside the patient and guide their actions .
# # What are the capabilities of HoloLens ?
HoloLens 2 offers the most comfortable and immersive mixed reality experience available , with industry-leading solutions that deliver value in minutes — all enhanced by the reliability , security , and scalability of cloud and AI services from Microsoft .
# # What are the core concepts of an experience ?
Get a demo of Mixed Reality and HoloLens at your local Microsoft Store .
HoloLens 2 can detect QR codes in the environment around the headset , establishing a coordinate system at each code &apos;s real-world location .
&gt; Support for immersive Windows Mixed Reality headsets on desktop PCs is not currently supported with the NuGet package below . Stay tuned for further updates on desktop support .
# # Getting the QR package
# # # Adding the webcam capability
You will need to add the capability `webcam` to your manifest to detect QR codes . This capability is required as the data within detected codes in the user &apos;s environment may contain sensitive information .
Permission can be requested by calling `QRCodeWatcher.RequestAccessAsync ( ) ` :
While QR code detection requires the `webcam` capability , the detection occurs using the device &apos;s tracking cameras . This provides a wider detection FOV and better battery life compared to detection with the device &apos;s photo / video ( PV ) camera .
# # # Detecting QR codes in Unity
# # Getting the coordinate system for a QR code
For a QRCode object , the following C + + code shows how to create a rectangle and place it using the QR code &apos;s coordinate system :
You can use the physical size to create the QR rectangle :
The coordinate system can be used to draw the QR code or attach holograms to the location :
Altogether , your * QRCodeAddedHandler * may look something like this :
# # Best practices for QR code detection
# # # Quiet zones around QR Codes
# # # Lighting and backdrop
# # # Size of QR codes
For QR codes between 5 and 10 cm length sides , you must be fairly close to detect the code . It will also take longer to detect codes at this size .
# # # QR codes with logos
QR codes with logos have not been tested and are currently unsupported .
# # # Managing QR code data
Windows Mixed Reality devices detect QR codes at the system level in the driver . When the device is rebooted , the detected QR codes are gone and will be re-detected as new objects next time .
It is recommended to configure your app to ignore QR codes older than a specific timestamp . Currently , the API does not support clearing QR code history .
For recommendations on where and how to place QR codes , please refer to &#91; Environment considerations for HoloLens &#93; ( environment-considerations-for-hololens.md ) .

If you are looking for specific details on how to develop for Scene Understanding or details on how Scene understanding works and how to develop for it , see the &#91; Scene Understanding SDK overview &#93; ( scene-understanding-SDK.md ) documentation .
&lt; td &gt; Scene understanding &lt; / td &gt;
* Common spatial mapping usage scenarios : placement , occlusion , physics and navigation . *
If your requirements can tolerate the increased latency of Scene understanding , application developers should consider using the Scene understanding watertight mesh , and presumably the spatial mapping mesh in unison with planar representations . This would provide a &quot; best of both worlds &quot; scenario where simplified watertight occlusion is married with finer nonplanar geometry providing the most realistic occlusion maps possible .

title : Voice commanding
When using voice commands , gaze is typically used as the targeting mechanism , whether as a pointer ( &quot; select &quot; ) or to direct your command to an application ( &quot; see it , say it &quot; ) . Of course , some voice commands don &apos;t require a target at all , like &quot; go to start &quot; or &quot; Hey , Cortana . &quot;
&lt; td &gt; Voice commanding &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; ✔ ️ ( with headset attached ) &lt; / td &gt;
* &quot; Hey Cortana &quot;
* &quot; Select &quot;
# # # &quot; Select &quot;
Saying &quot; select &quot; at any time will activate whatever the gaze cursor is pointing at .
&gt; Note : In HoloLens 2 , the gaze cursor needs to first be invoked by saying the word &quot; select &quot; . Say &quot; select &quot; again to activate . To hide the gaze cursor , simply use your hands to airtap or touch an object .
# # # See it , say it
Windows Mixed Reality has employed a &quot; see it , say it &quot; voice model where * * labels on buttons are identical to the associated voice commands * * . Because there isn ’ t any dissonance between the label and the voice command , users can better understand what to say to control the system . To reinforce this , while dwelling on a button , a * * &quot; voice dwell tip &quot; * * appears to communicate which buttons are voice enabled .
* Examples of &quot; see it , say it &quot; *
# # # Voice &apos;s strengths
* * How using voice can benefit the user * *
* Reduces time - it should make the end goal more efficient .
* Minimizes effort - it should make tasks more fluid and effortless .
* Reduces cognitive load - it &apos;s intuitive , easy to learn , and remember .

# # Update scene / project settings in Unity
After addressing any breaking changes after moving to the updated Unity version , developers should build and test their current applications on HoloLens ( 1st gen ) . This is a good time to create and save a commit into source control .
Review all DLL dependencies in your application . It is advisable to remove any dependency that is no longer needed from your project . For remaining plugins that are required , ingest the respective ARM32 or ARM64 binaries into your Unity project .
Please read the following for more information on using MRTK version 2 :
# # # Prepare for the migration
- Test after every change and use source control .
- Use default MRTK UX ( buttons , slates , etc ) , when possible .
- Refrain from modifying MRTK files directly ; create wrappers around MRTK components .
- This action eases future MRTK ingestions and updates .
- Review and explore sample scenes provided in the MRTK , especially * HandInteractionExamples.scene * .
- Rebuild canvas-based UI with quads , colliders , and TextMeshPro text .
- Set Single Pass Instanced Rendering Path .
# # # Testing your application
# # Updating your interaction model for HoloLens 2
In HoloLens ( 1st gen ) , your application likely has a gaze and commit interaction model with holograms relatively far away to fit into the field of view .
Steps to update your application design to be best suited for HoloLens 2 :
- The shader compiler on ARM runs during the first draw call after the shader has been loaded or something the shader relies on has changed , not at shader load time . The impact on framerate can be very noticeable , depending on how many shaders need to be compiled . This has various implications for how shaders should be handled , packaged , updated differently on HoloLens 2 vs HoloLens ( 1st gen ) .
title : Case study - Spatial sound design for HoloTour
# Case study : Spatial sound design for HoloTour
We created HoloTour experiences of two different locations : Rome and Machu Picchu . To make these tours feel authentic and compelling , we wanted to capture audio from the locations where we filmed instead of using generic sounds .
* Custom camera and microphone rig *
When we indexed on the camera-capture audio , we placed spatial sound-enabled ambient audio emitters that corresponded to the directional orientation of the cameras . The north camera view plays audio from the north microphone , and likewise for the other cardinal directions . These emitters are world-locked , which means that when the user turns their head in relation to them , the sound changes . This technique effectively models the sound of standing at that location . Listen to Piazza Navona or The Pantheon for examples of scenes that use a good mix of camera-captured audio .
# # Tips and tricks
There are some additional ways to highlight directionality and improve immersion to make full use of the spatial sound capabilities of HoloLens . We &apos;ve provided a list here . Listen for these effects the next time that you try HoloTour .
title : Voice input in Unity
# Voice input in Unity
Unity exposes three ways to add &#91; Voice input &#93; ( voice-input.md ) to your Unity application .
&gt; Only dictation or phrase recognition can be handled at once . That means if a GrammarRecognizer or KeywordRecognizer is active , a DictationRecognizer can not be active and vice versa .
# # Enabling the capability for Voice
The * * Microphone * * capability must be declared for an app to leverage Voice input .
1 . In the Unity Editor , go to the player settings by navigating to &quot; Edit &gt; Project Settings &gt; Player &quot;
1 . Specify which phrases to listen for using a KeywordRecognizer or GrammarRecognizer
2 . Handle the OnPhraseRecognized event and take action corresponding to the phrase recognized
Then let &apos;s add a few fields to your class to store the recognizer and keyword- &gt; action dictionary :
Now add a keyword to the dictionary ( e.g. inside of a Start ( ) method ) . We &apos;re adding the &quot; activate &quot; keyword in this example :
Now register for the OnPhraseRecognized event
Finally , start recognizing !
Create a GrammarRecognizer and pass it the path to your SRGS file :
1 . Create a new DictationRecognizer
2 . Handle Dictation events
# # # Enabling the capability for dictation
The &quot; Internet Client &quot; capability , in addition to the &quot; Microphone &quot; capability mentioned above , must be declared for an app to leverage dictation .
1 . In the Unity Editor , go to the player settings by navigating to &quot; Edit &gt; Project Settings &gt; Player &quot; page
Create a DictationRecognizer like so :
First , subscribe to the DictationResult event :
Then handle the DictationResult callback :
First , subscribe to the DictationHypothesis event :
Then handle the DictationHypothesis callback :
This event is fired when the recognizer stops , whether from Stop ( ) being called , a timeout occurring , or some other error .
First , subscribe to the DictationComplete event :
This event is fired when an error occurs .
First , subscribe to the DictationError event :
Then handle the DictationError callback :
* Start ( ) and Stop ( ) methods respectively enable and disable dictation recognition .
2 . If the recognizer has given a result but then hears silence for twenty seconds , it will timeout .
In order to restore all recognizers to their previous state , after the DictationRecognizer has stopped , you can call :
You could also just start a KeywordRecognizer , which will restart the PhraseRecognitionSystem as well .

As Research Mode is now available since May 2018 , we are starting to see several interesting demos and applications being developed for HoloLens .
We encourage submissions on the topics of ( ego-centric ) object recognition , hand and user tracking , activity recognition , SLAM , 3D reconstruction , scene understanding , sensor-based localization , navigation and more .
* Paper submission deadline : May 17
* Notification to authors : May 24
Note that submissions of previously published work are allowed ( including work accepted to the main CVPR 2019 conference ) .
# Case study - The pursuit of more personal computing
# # # Culminating core technologies
* * * Voice * * , in terms of speech and conversation , is enabling users to communicate with computers through more natural means — answering bots through text or issuing commands to conversational hardware .
For example , think about shared experiences in mixed reality like the OnSight tool NASA ’ s Jet Propulsion Laboratory built for scientists . Instead of building a system to look at Martian data ( abstracting the data onto screens or displays ) , they brought scientists inside the data , effectively putting them on the surface of Mars as they collaborated .
# # # Building on a foundation
In this world of contextual experiences , catering to the mobility of the user is key . Moving fluidly between devices and services , with highly personalized contexts , users will travel about the physical world seamlessly — creating a * massive * platform challenge . When the physical world becomes a digital end-point , interoperability reigns supreme .
&gt; * “ Bringing together the digital universe and the physical world will unlock human potential … enabling every person and organization on the planet to achieve more . ” * &lt; br &gt;
# # Designing for tomorrow &apos;s experiences today

title : Best practices for working with Unity and Visual Studio
# # Improving iteration time
* Debug Unity in-editor play mode from Visual Studio by putting breakpoints , evaluating variables and complex expressions .
* Use the Unity Project Explorer to find your script with the exact same hierarchy that Unity displays .
* Get the Unity console directly inside Visual Studio .
# # Expose C # class variables for easy tuning
There are two ways to expose class variables . The recommended way is to add the &#91; SerializeField &#93; attribute to your private variables . This allows them to be accessed from the editor but not programmatically exposed . The other option is to make C # class variables public to expose them in the editor UI .
Both approaches make it possible to easily tweak variables while playing in-editor . This is especially useful for tuning interaction mechanic properties .
# 2 . Using speech recognition to execute commands
* Learn how Azure speech recognition can be used to execute commands
In the Hierarchy window , select the * * Lunarcom * * object , then in the Inspector window , use the * * Add Component * * button to add the * * Lunarcom Wake Word Recognizer ( Script ) * * component to the Lunarcom object and configure it as follows :
* In the * * Wake Word * * field , enter a suitable phrase , for example , _ Activate terminal _ .
* In the * * Dismiss Word * * field , enter a suitable phrase , for example , _ Dismiss terminal _ .
&gt; The Lunarcom Wake Word Recognizer ( Script ) component is not part of MRTK . It was provided with this tutorial &apos;s assets .
If you now enter Game mode , as in the previous tutorial , the terminal panel is enabled by default , but you can now disable it by saying the Dismiss Word , * * Dismiss terminal * * :
And enable it again by saying the Wake Word , * * Activate terminal * * :
You have implemented speech commands powered by Azure . Run the application on your device to ensure the feature is working properly .

# Locatable camera in Unity
# # Enabling the capability for Photo Video Camera
The &quot; WebCam &quot; capability must be declared for an app to use the &#91; camera &#93; ( locatable-camera.md ) .
1 . In the Unity Editor , go to the player settings by navigating to the &quot; Edit &gt; Project Settings &gt; Player &quot; page
Only a single operation can occur with the camera at a time . To determine which mode ( photo , video , or none ) the camera is currently in , you can check UnityEngine.XR.WSA.WebCam.Mode .
2 . Create a * CameraParameters * object with the settings you want
4 . Take the desired photo
5 . Stop Photo Mode and clean up resources
# # # Common Set Up for PhotoCapture
Start by creating a * PhotoCapture * object
Next , store your object , set your parameters , and start Photo Mode
# # # Capture a Photo to a File
When capturing data to a Texture2D , the process is extremely similar to capturing to disk .
In * OnPhotoModeStarted * , capture a frame to memory .
You will then apply your result to a texture and use the common clean up code above .
4 . Start recording video
5 . Stop recording video
6 . Stop Video Mode and clean up resources
Once started , begin the recording
After recording has started , you could update your UI or behaviors to enable stopping . Here you just log .

&lt; td &gt; Bloom &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Wrist button &lt; / td &gt;
&lt; td &gt; Eye gaze and palm up pinch &lt; / td &gt;
To bring up the start menu in HoloLens ( 1st gen ) , we designed “ Bloom ” , which is a symbolic gesture mimicking the flower blossom . It &apos;s distinctive for surefooted interaction , easy to perform , and quick to recall . To do the bloom gesture on HoloLens ( 1st gen ) , hold out your hand with your palm up and fingertips together , then open your hand by spreading your fingers .
In HoloLens 2 , we replaced the Bloom gesture with a virtual wrist button that allows for more instinctual interactions that require no additional teaching . By showing users the button on the wrist , they can intuitively reach out and press it with their other hand .
&gt; For the one-handed Start gesture to work :
&gt; 1 . You must update to the November 2019 update ( build 18363.1039 ) or later .
&gt; 1 . Your eyes must be calibrated on the device so that eye tracking functions correctly . If you do not see orbiting dots around the Start icon when you look at it , your eyes are not calibrated on the device .

# Case study - Creating impossible perspectives for HoloTour
We wanted your experiences in HoloTour for Microsoft HoloLens to be unforgettable . In addition to the traditional tourist stops , we planned out some &quot; impossible perspectives &quot; – moments that would be impossible to experience on any tour but which , via the technology in HoloLens , we could bring directly to your living room . Creating the content for these experiences required some different techniques than our standard capture process .

title : Creating a holographic DirectX project
# Creating a holographic DirectX project
The mixed reality app , however , has some additional capabilities that aren &apos;t present in a typical Direct3D UWP app . The Windows Mixed Reality app template is able to :
* Handle Direct3D device resources associated with holographic cameras .
* Retrieve camera back buffers from the system , or ( in the case of Direct3D12 ) create holographic back buffer resources and manage resource lifetimes .
* Go into full-screen stereo rendering mode .
# # How do I get started ?

&#124; `GeometryShader.hlsl` &#124; A pass-through that leaves the geometry unmodified . &#124;
&#124; `PixelShader.hlsl` &#124; Passes through the color data . The color data is interpolated and assigned to a pixel at the rasterization step . &#124;
&#124; `VertexShader.hlsl` &#124; Simple shader to do vertex processing on the GPU . &#124;
&#124; `VPRTVertexShader.hlsl` &#124; Simple shader to do vertex processing on the GPU , that is optimized for Windows Mixed Reality stereo rendering . &#124;
`VertexShaderShared.hlsl` contains common code shared between `VertexShader.hlsl` and `VPRTVertexShader.hlsl` .
Note : The Direct3D 12 app template also includes `ViewInstancingVertexShader.hlsl`. This variant uses D3D12 optional features to render stereo images more efficiently .

To render to holographic camera views , once per frame the app will :
# # # Process camera updates
# # # Get the coordinate system to use as a basis for rendering
# # # Process gaze and gesture input
# # # Process time-based updates
# # # Update constant buffer data
Rendering on Windows Mixed Reality is not much different from rendering on a 2D mono display , but there are some differences you need to be aware of :
* Windows Mixed Reality controls the camera views . You need to render to each one because the holographic frame will be presenting them for you later .
# # # Get an updated HolographicFrame prediction
# # # Render to each camera
* * Set up your rendering pass * *
Each camera has its own render target ( back buffer ) , and view and projection matrices , into the holographic space . Your app will need to create any other camera-based resources - such as the depth buffer - on a per-camera basis . In the Windows Holographic app template , we provide a helper class to bundle these resources together in DX : : CameraResources . Start by setting up the render target views :
The viewport should be set each frame . Your vertex shader ( at least ) will generally need access to the view / projection data .

title : Updating 2D UWP apps for mixed reality
To build a new 2D app for mixed reality , you simply build a standard 2D Universal Windows Platform ( UWP ) app . No other app changes are required for that app to then run as a slate in mixed reality .
# # # Bringing an existing 2D Store app to UWP
&#124; Starting Point &#124; AppX Manifest Platform Target &#124; How to make this Universal ? &#124;
Just go to the Start menu within the mixed reality headset and launch the app from there . The desktop shell and the holographic shell both share the same set of UWP apps , and so the app should already be present once you &apos;ve deployed from Visual Studio .
# # Targeting both immersive headsets and HoloLens
Congratulations ! Your app is now using the Windows 10 Universal Windows Platform ( UWP ) .
# # # Change your device family to Windows.Universal
Now let &apos;s jump into your AppX manifest to ensure your Windows 10 UWP app can run on HoloLens :
* Ensure your Target Platform is Windows.Universal in the dependencies section
Now that your UWP app targets &quot; Windows.Universal &quot; , let &apos;s build your app and run it in the &#91; HoloLens Emulator &#93; ( using-the-hololens-emulator.md ) .
* Make sure you have &#91; installed the HoloLens Emulator &#93; ( install-the-tools.md ) .
* Select * * Debug &gt; Start Debugging * * to deploy your app and start debugging .
* With a keyboard , mouse , and / or an Xbox controller , place your app in the world to launch it .
At this point , one of two things can happen :
1 . Your app will show its splash and start running after it is placed in the Emulator ! Awesome !
# # # Running your UWP app in the debugger
These steps will walk you through debugging your UWP app using the Visual Studio debugger .
* Visual Studio should now break somewhere in your app code .
Now that your UWP app is running on immersive headsets and / or HoloLens as a 2D hologram , next we &apos;ll make sure it looks beautiful . Here are some things to consider :
# # # 2D app view resolution and scale factor
* It matches the fixed DPI and effective pixels for UWP apps running on Xbox One , enabling seamless experiences across devices .
# # # 2D app view interface design best practices
* Use the &quot; light &quot; color theme recommendations from Windows .
* Change your UI too drastically when in mixed reality , to ensure users have a familiar experience in and out of the headset .
* App bar UI in 2D app view *
# # # Test your 2D app &apos;s design
Here are the high level concepts / scenarios you should understand for input when bringing your UWP app to HoloLens :
* &#91; Gaze &#93; ( gaze-and-commit.md ) turns into hover events , which can unexpectedly trigger menus , flyouts or other user interface elements to pop up just by gazing around your app .
&#91; Voice input &#93; ( voice-input.md ) is a critical part of the mixed reality experience . We &apos;ve enabled all of the speech APIs that are in Windows 10 powering Cortana when using a headset .
# # Publish and Maintain your Universal app
Once your app is up and running , package your app to &#91; submit it to the Microsoft Store &#93; ( submitting-an-app-to-the-microsoft-store.md ) .

title : Use spatial sound in mixed-reality applications
# How to use sound in mixed-reality applications
# # When to add sounds
# # # Inform and reinforce
* Interactions may have several stages . Use sound to reinforce stage transitions .
* For button hover sounds ( see the following information ) , add a time delay to prevent excessive sound triggering .
# # # Don &apos;t rely solely on sounds
* For hover sounds , consider using a subtle and non-threatening sound , such as a low-frequency thud or bump .
On HoloLens 2 , articulated hand tracking supports direct manipulation of user-interface elements . Sounds are important when there &apos;s no other physical feedback .
A * button press * sound is important in direct manipulation because the user doesn &apos;t get any other indication when they reach the bottom of the key stroke . Sound indicators of key travel can be small , subtle , and occluded . As with gesture interactions , button presses should get a short , tactile sound like a click . Unpresses should have a similar click sound but with raised pitch .
* Use a positive-sounding tone for voice command * confirmations * . Rising tones and major musical intervals are effective .
* Use a shorter , less-positive-sounding tone for voice command * failures * . Avoid negative sounds . Instead , use a more percussive , neutral sound to communicate that the application is moving on from the interaction .
* If your application has a wake word , use a short , gentle tone when the device * starts listening * . Use a subtle looping sound while the application * is * listening .
* For gradual movements , a &quot; whoosh &quot; sound during movement helps the user track the object .
* Message notification * sounds may be heard repeatedly , sometimes in quick succession . It &apos;s important that they doesn &apos;t stand out or sound harsh . Mid-range positive tonal sounds are effective .
A sound should be spatialized when it &apos;s associated with an event that has a spatial location . This includes UI , embodied AI voices , and visual indicators .
In contrast , avoid spatialization for * faceless AI voices * and other elements that lack a well-defined spatial location . Spatialization without a related visual element can distract users into thinking there &apos;s a visual element that they can &apos;t find .
Spatialization does come with some CPU cost . Many applications have at most two sounds playing simultaneously . The cost of spatialization in that case is likely negligible . You can use the MRTK frame rate monitor to judge the impact of adding spatialization .
# # # When and how to apply distance-based attenuation
The distances to * visual indicators * , * animated holograms * , and other informative sounds are usually relevant to the user . Use distance-based attenuation to intuitively provide cues .
# # # Which spatialization technology to use
With headphones or the HoloLens speakers , use head-related transfer function ( HRTF ) -based spatialization technologies . These technologies model the sound propagation around the head in the physical world . Even when a sound source is on the far side of one &apos;s head , sound propagates to the distant ear with some attenuation and delay . Speaker panning , in contrast , relies only on attenuation and applies total attenuation in the left ear when sounds are on the right side ( and vice-versa ) . This technique can be uncomfortable for &quot; normal hearing &quot; listeners and inaccessible for listeners who have hearing impairment in one ear .

title : Audio in mixed reality
# Audio in mixed reality
* Guide users to next steps .
The low-latency head tracking of mixed reality headsets , including HoloLens , supports high-quality HRTF-based spatialization . You can spatialize audio in your application to :
* Call attention to visual elements .
See detailed &#91; examples of design that uses audio &#93; ( spatial-sound-design.md ) .
&lt; td &gt; Spatialization hardware acceleration &lt; / td &gt;
&#91; Use of sounds in mixed reality &#93; ( spatial-sound-design.md ) requires a different approach than in touch and keyboard-and-mouse applications . Key sound design decisions include which sounds to spatialize and which interactions to sonify . These decisions strongly effect user confidence , productivity , and learning curve .
HoloTour virtually takes users to tourist and historical sites around the world . See the &#91; Sound design for HoloTour &#93; ( case-study-spatial-sound-design-for-holotour.md ) case study . A special microphone and rendering setup were used to capture the subject spaces .
RoboRaid is a high-energy shooter for HoloLens . The &#91; Sound design for RoboRaid &#93; ( case-study-using-spatial-sound-in-roboraid.md ) case study describes the design choices that were made to ensure spatial audio was used to the fullest dramatic effect .
# # # Should I spatialize ?
HRTFs manipulate the level and phase differences between ears across the frequency spectrum . They &apos;re based on physical models and measurements of human head , torso , and ear shapes ( pinnae ) . Our brains respond to these differences to provide perceived direction in sound .
Every individual has a unique ear shape , head size , and ear position . So the best HRTFs conform to you . To increase spatialization accuracy , HoloLens uses your inter-pupilary distance ( IPD ) from the headset displays to adjust the HRTFs for your head size .
# # # Spatializer middleware support
Support for Windows &apos; HRTFs is available for the following third-party audio engines .
* A &#91; Unity audio engine plugin &#93; ( spatial-sound-in-unity.md )
Spatial audio is about more than direction . Other dimensions include occlusion , obstruction , reverb , portalling , and source modeling . Collectively these dimensions are referred to as * acoustics * . Without acoustics , spatialized sounds lack perceived distance .

title : Direct manipulation with hands
# Direct manipulation with hands
&lt; td &gt; Direct manipulation with hands &lt; / td &gt;
On HoloLens 2 , the user &apos;s hands are recognized and interpreted as left and right hand skeletal models . To implement the idea of touching holograms directly with hands , ideally , five colliders could be attached to the five fingertips of each hand skeletal model . However , due to the lack of tactile feedback , ten collidable fingertips can cause unexpected and unpredictable collisions with holograms .
* * Collidable fingertip * * &lt; br &gt;
* * One-finger press * * &lt; br &gt;
* * One-finger tap * * &lt; br &gt;
* * Five-finger press * * &lt; br &gt;
With interactive feedback , users can achieve high precision near-targeting tasks , such as triggering a hyperlink or pressing a button as shown below .
* * Fingertip cursor far * * &lt; br &gt;
* * Fingertip cursor near * * &lt; br &gt;
* * Fingertip cursor contact * * &lt; br &gt;
* * Hover ( far ) * * &lt; br &gt;
* * Hover ( near ) * * &lt; br &gt;
* * Contact begins * * &lt; br &gt;
* * Contact ends * * &lt; br &gt;
* The second mechanism is depression . Depression creates a sense of pressing down after a fingertip contacts a button . The mechanism ensures that the button tightly moves with the fingertip along the depth axis . The button can be triggered when it reaches a designated depth ( on press ) or leaves the depth ( on release ) after passing through it .
* * Finger is far away * * &lt; br &gt;
* * Finger approaches * * &lt; br &gt;
# # # To interact with the slate contact
Grab the manipulation affordances and perform reflow via the edge affordances .
# # # Non-affordance based manipulation
With HoloLens ( 1st gen ) , we taught users a couple of predefined gestures , such as bloom and air tap . For HoloLens 2 , we don &apos;t ask users to memorize any symbolic gestures . All required user gestures , where users need to interact with holograms and content , are instinctual . The way to achieve instinctual gestures is to help users perform gestures through the design of UI affordances .
* * Small object * * &lt; br &gt;
* * Medium object * * &lt; br &gt;
* * Large object * * &lt; br &gt;
# # Symmetric design between hands and 6 DoF controllers
# # Optimize with eye tracking
* * * When * * : Reduce unintentionally triggering a manipulation response . Eye tracking allows for better understanding what a user is currently engaged with .
For example , imagine you are reading through a holographic ( instructional ) text when reaching over to grab you real-world work tool .
By doing so , you accidentally move your hand across some interactive holographic buttons that you hadn &apos;t even noticed before ( e.g. it may be outside the user &apos;s field-of-view ( FoV ) ) .
* * * Which one * * : Aside from addressing false positive activations , another example includes better identifying which holograms to grab or poke as the precise intersection point may not be clear from your perspective , especially if several holograms are positioned close to each other .
* * * Where to * * : Use information about what a user is looking at with quick-throwing gestures . Grab a hologram and roughly toss it toward your intended destination .

title : Tracking loss in Unity
# Tracking loss in Unity
When the device cannot locate itself in the world , the app experiences &quot; tracking loss &quot; . By default , Unity will pause the update loop and display a splash image to the user . When tracking is regained , the splash image goes away and the update loop continues .
By default , the update loop of the app as well as all messages and events will stop for the duration of tracking loss . At that same time , an image will be displayed to the user . You can customize this image by going to Edit- &gt; Settings- &gt; Player , clicking Splash Image , and setting the Holographic Tracking Loss image .
When handling tracking changes on your own you either need to poll for the state property each frame or handle the * OnPositionalLocatorStateChanged * event .
The most important state is * PositionalLocatorState.Active * which means tracking is fully functional . Any other state will result in only rotational deltas to the main camera . For example :

# # Designing for content
Placing objects in the periphery can encourage users to look to the side and this can be aided by attention directors , as described below .
Horizontal head movement is more &#91; comfortable &#93; ( comfort.md ) for frequent interactions , while vertical movements should be reserved for uncommon events . For example , an experience involving a long horizontal timeline should limit vertical head movement for interactions ( like looking down at a menu ) .

title : Shared experiences in mixed reality
# Shared experiences in mixed reality
# # # 1 . How are they sharing ?
* Small &lt; 7
Group size makes for an important question because it influences :
# # # 3 . Where is everyone ?
* * * Co-located * * : All your users will be in the same physical space .
* * * Remote * * : All your users will be in separate physical spaces .
* * * Both * * : Your users will be a mix of co-located and remote spaces .
This question is crucial because it influences :
* How people communicate ?
* For example : Whether they should have avatars ?
* What objects they see . Are all objects shared ?
# # # 4 . When are they sharing ?
* * * Synchronously * * : Sharing the holographic experience at the same time . For example : Two students performing the skills lab at the same time .
* * * Asynchronously * * : Sharing the holographic experience at different times . For example : Two students performing the skills lab but working on separate sections at different times .
* * * Both * * : Your users will sometimes be sharing synchronously but other times asynchronously . For example : A professor grading the assignment performed by the students at a later time and leaving notes for students for the next day .
* Object and environment persistence . For example : Storing the states so they can be retrieved .
* User perspective . For example : Perhaps remembering what the user was looking at when leaving notes .
* * * Dissimilar * * : Environments that are quite different in furniture settings , room sizes , light and sound considerations . For example : A professor is in a focus room whereas students are in a large lecture hall , filled with students and teachers .
It &apos;s important to &#91; think about the environment &#93; ( environment-considerations-for-hololens.md ) , as it will influence :
* Scale of the objects . For example : Placing a 6 feet human model on a table could be challenging but a heart model would work great .
# # Get started building shared experiences
* * * Match-making * * : Ability to create sessions , advertise sessions , discover and invite specific people , both locally and remotely to join your session .
* * * Anchor sharing * * : Ability to align coordinates across multiple devices in a common local space , so holograms appear in the same place for all people .
* * * Networking * * : Ability to have positions , interactions and movements of people and holograms synchronized in real-time across all participants .
* * * State storage * * : Ability to store hologram characteristics and locations in space for mid-session join , recall at a later time , and robustness against network issues .
* First the user places the hologram .
* App creates a &#91; spatial anchor &#93; ( spatial-anchors.md ) , to pin that hologram precisely in the world .

# Focus point in Unity
If you want to set the Focus Point in Unity , it needs to be set every frame using * HolographicSettings.SetFocusPointForFrame ( ) * . If the Focus Point is not set for a frame , the default stabilization plane will be used .
&gt; * On an immersive desktop headset , this will enable per-pixel depth-based reprojection .
&gt; * On a HoloLens running the Windows 10 April 2018 Update or later , this will analyze the depth buffer to pick an optimal stabilization plane automatically .
&gt; Either approach should provide even better image quality without explicit work by your app to select a focus point for each frame . Note that if you do provide a focus point manually , that will override the automatic behavior described above , and will usually reduce hologram stability . Generally , you should only specify a manual focus point when your app is running on a HoloLens that has not yet been updated to the Windows 10 April 2018 Update .
1 . The user will speak into a microphone connected to an immersive ( VR ) headset ( or the built-in microphone of HoloLens ) .
2 . The app will capture the dictation and send it to the Azure Translator Text API .
3 . The translation result will be displayed in a simple UI group in the Unity Scene .
- Internet access for Azure setup and translation retrieval
- If you &apos;re using a microphone and headphones connected to ( or built-in to ) your headset , make sure the option “ When I wear my headset , switch to headset mic ” is turned on in * * Settings &gt; Mixed reality &gt; Audio and speech * * .
&gt; Be aware that if you are developing for an immersive headset for this lab , you may experience audio output device issues . This is due to an issue with Unity , which is fixed in later versions of Unity ( Unity 2018.2 ) . The issue prevents Unity from changing the default audio output device at run time . As a work around , ensure you have completed the above steps , and close and re-open the Editor , when this issue presents itself .
# # Chapter 1 – The Azure Portal
# # Chapter 2 – Set up the Unity project
&gt; Be aware , you must save your Unity scenes within the * Assets * folder , as they must be associated with the Unity Project . Creating the scenes folder ( and other similar folders ) is a typical way of structuring a Unity project .
7 . The remaining settings , in * Build Settings * , should be left as default for now .
4 . The * Transform * component should then look like :
&gt; - * * Clear Flags : * * Solid Color .
# # Chapter 4 – Setup Debug Canvas
To show the input and output of the translation , a basic UI needs to be created . For this course , you will create a Canvas UI object , with several ‘ Text ’ objects to show the data .
3 . Next , change the following parameters in the * Inspector Panel ’ s Rect Transform * :
&#124; Name &#124; Transform - * Position * &#124; Width &#124; Height &#124;
&#124; Name &#124; Text &#124; Font Size &#124;
&#124; MicrophoneStatusLabel &#124; Microphone Status : &#124; 20 &#124;
&#124; AzureResponseLabel &#124; Azure Web Response &#124; 20 &#124;
&#124; DictationLabel &#124; You just said : &#124; 20 &#124;
&#124; TranslationResultLabel &#124; Translation : &#124; 20 &#124;
8 . For each of these children , select it and use the below tables to set the parameters in the Inspector Panel .
9 . Next , select the &apos; centre &apos; alignment option for each text component :
1 . In the * Hierarchy Panel * :
# # Chapter 5 – Create the Results class
- The response result from Azure .
- The microphone status .
- The result of the dictation ( voice to text ) .
- The result of the translation .
7 . Finally , add the methods which are responsible for outputting the various results information to the UI .
The second class you are going to create is the * MicrophoneManager * .
- Detecting the recording device attached to the headset or machine ( whichever is the default ) .
- Capture the audio ( voice ) and use dictation to store it as a string .
- Once the voice has paused , submit the dictation to the Translator class .
- Host a method that can stop the voice capture if desired .
3 . Double click on the new script to open it with Visual Studio .
4 . Update the namespaces to be the same as the following , at the top of the * MicrophoneManager * class :
5 . Then , add the following variables inside the * MicrophoneManager * class :
The last script you need to create is the * Translator * class .
- Receive the translated result and pass it to the * Results * Class to be visualized in the UI .
5 . Then add the following variables inside the * Translator * class :
8 . The coroutine to obtain the Token is the following :
# # Chapter 9 – Test in mixed reality
- All the settings mentioned in &#91; Chapter 1 &#93; ( # chapter-1--the-azure-portal ) are set correctly .
- All the fields in the * Main Camera Inspector Panel * are assigned properly .
# # Chapter 10 – Build the UWP solution and sideload on local machine
# # Chapter 11 – Deploy your application
7 . You are now ready to start translating !
# # Your finished Translation Text API application
Congratulations , you built a mixed reality app that leverages the Azure Translation Text API to convert speech to translated text .

&gt; Do not delete the * * None * * intent .
&gt; This * Intent * name is used within the code later in this course , so for best results , use this name exactly as provided .
Once you confirm the name you will be directed to the Intents Page .
&gt; LUIS converts all Utterances to lower case .
You will notice that the new * Utterance * will appear in a list underneath .
Following the same process , insert the following six ( 6 ) Utterances :
For each Utterance you have created , you must identify which words should be used by LUIS as Entities . In this example you need to label all the colors as a * color * Entity , and all the possible reference to a target as a * target * Entity .
18 . Repeat the process above until all the Utterances have the Entities labelled . See the below image if you need help .
&gt; - For single words just click them .
&gt; - For a set of two or more words , click at the beginning and then at the end of the set .
22 . Following the same process as the previous Intent , insert the following eight ( 8 ) Utterances for * Size * change :
2 . Set the * Timezone * to your time zone .
26 . In the section * Resources and Keys * :
&gt; Underneath * Endpoint * , take a copy of the endpoint corresponding to the Key you have inserted , you will soon use it in your code .
# # Chapter 3 – Set up the Unity project
# # Chapter 4 – Create the scene
3 . Repeat the above procedure to add the following objects :
4 . The resulting scene * Hierarchy * should be like the one in the image below :
7 . Search for the component called * Audio Source * , as shown above .
&#124; &#124; Transform - * Position * &#124; &#124;
16 . Your Hierarchy Panel structure should now look like this :
17 . The final scene should look like the image below :
# # Chapter 5 – Create the MicrophoneManager class
The * MicrophoneManager * class is responsible for :
- Once the voice has paused , submit the dictation to the * LuisManager * class .
5 . Then add the following variables inside the * MicrophoneManager * class :
&gt; Delete the * Update ( ) * method since this class will not use it .
It is time for you to create the * LuisManager * class , which will make the call to the Azure LUIS service .
This class will deserialize the * JSON * response and call the appropriate methods of the * Behaviours * class to trigger an action .
6 . Next , add the following variables inside the * LuisManager * class :
7 . Make sure to place your LUIS endpoint in now ( which you will have from your LUIS portal ) .
8 . Code for the * Awake ( ) * method now needs to be added . This method will be called when the class initializes :
10 . Once the value of the Intent , and associated Entities , have been determined , they are passed to the instance of the * Behaviours * class to trigger the intended action .
&gt; At this point you will notice several errors appearing in the * Unity Editor Console Panel * . This is because the code references the * Behaviours * class which you will create in the next Chapter .
# # Chapter 7 – Create the Behaviours class
The * Behaviours * class will trigger the actions using the Entities provided by the * LuisManager * class .
4 . Then add the following variables inside the * Behaviours * class :
5 . Add the * Awake ( ) * method code . This method will be called when the class initializes :
# # Chapter 8 – Create the Gaze Class
The last class that you will need to complete this app is the * Gaze * class . This class updates the reference to the * GameObject * currently in the user ’ s visual focus .
4 . Insert the following code for this class :
# # Chapter 9 – Completing the scene setup
4 . The result should look like the image below :
# # Chapter 10 – Test in the Unity Editor
- All the scripts are attached to the * * Main Camera * * object .
2 . Try a few utterances , such as :
# # Chapter 11 – Build and sideload the UWP Solution
5 . Create a * BUILDS * folder and within that folder create another folder with an appropriate name of your choice .
# # Chapter 12 – Improving your LUIS service
To improve the level of understanding provided by LUIS you need to capture new utterances and use them to re-train your LUIS App .
For example , you might have trained LUIS to understand “ Increase ” and “ Upsize ” , but wouldn ’ t you want your app to also understand words like “ Enlarge ” ?
Once you have used your application a few times , everything you have said will be collected by LUIS and available in the LUIS PORTAL .
4 . You will be shown a list of the Utterances that have been sent to LUIS by your mixed reality Application .
You will notice some highlighted * Entities * .
In the example above , it was found that the word “ spear ” had been highlighted as a target , so it necessary to correct the mistake , which is done by hovering over the word with the mouse and clicking * * Remove Label * * .
7 . Once you have sorted all the displayed Utterances , try and reload the page to see if more are available .
# # Your finished LUIS Integrated application
Congratulations , you built a mixed reality app that leverages the Azure Language Understanding Intelligence Service , to understand what a user says , and act on that information .

title : Local anchor transfers in DirectX
# Local anchor transfers in DirectX
# # Transferring spatial anchors
Note that spatial anchors are not able to transfer between different device types , for example a HoloLens spatial anchor may not be locatable using an immersive headset . Transferred anchors are also not compatible with iOS or Android devices .
Declare this capability in the package.appxmanifest file for your app . Here &apos;s an example :
A helper function is included in the code sample to load previously exported data . This deserialization function provides a collection of key-value pairs , similar to what the SpatialAnchorStore provides - except that we got this data from another source , such as a network socket . You can process and reason about this data before storing it offline , using in-app memory , or ( if applicable ) your app &apos;s SpatialAnchorStore .
# # # Export of multiple SpatialAnchors
* * NOTE : * * If you run this sample code , ensure that you configure and launch the server before starting the client .
Again , we must be prepared to handle unknown network errors .
title : Spatial mapping in DirectX
# Spatial mapping in DirectX
When developing an application using these APIs , your basic program flow will look like this ( as demonstrated in the sample application described below ) :
- Instantiate a SpatialSurfaceObserver object .
- Each call to TryComputeLatestMeshAsync will aysnchronously return one SpatialSurfaceMesh object .
# # # Set up your app to use the spatialPerception capability
# # # Check for spatial mapping feature support
Note that when the UWP contract is less than level 4 , the app should proceed as though the device is capable of doing spatial mapping .
# # # Request access to spatial mapping data
Next , you need to configure the surface observer to observe a specific bounding volume . Here , we observe a box that is 20x20x5 meters , centered at the origin of the coordinate system .
Note that you can set multiple bounding volumes instead .
* This is pseudocode : *
It is also possible to use other bounding shapes - such as a view frustum , or a bounding box that is not axis aligned .
# # # Initialize and update the surface mesh collection
If the surface observer was successfully created , we can proceed to initialize our surface mesh collection . Here , we use the pull model API to get the current set of observed surfaces right away :
There is also a push model available to get surface mesh data . You are free to design your app to use only the pull model if you choose , in which case you &apos;ll poll for data every so often - say , once per frame - or during a specific time period , such as during game setup . If so , the above code is what you need .
* * NOTE : * * This might not be the most efficient way for your app to handle mesh data . This code is written for clarity and is not optimized .
The implementation of mesh pruning in RealtimeSurfaceMeshRenderer.cpp :
# # # Acquire and use surface mesh data buffers
From RealtimeSurfaceMeshRenderer.cpp :
From SurfaceMesh.cpp :
First , we acquire the raw data buffers :
Then , we create Direct3D device buffers with the mesh data provided by the HoloLens :
# # # Update and render surface meshes
Once this is done , we loop on our meshes and tell each one to draw itself . * * NOTE : * * This sample code is not optimized to use any sort of frustum culling , but you should include this feature in your app .
# # # Rendering choices with Surface Mapping
The Surface Mapping code sample offers code for occlusion-only rendering of surface mesh data , and for on-screen rendering of surface mesh data . Which path you choose - or both - depends on your application . We &apos;ll walk through both configurations in this document .
* * Rendering occlusion buffers for holographic effect * *
From AppMain.cpp :
Based on code from SpecialEffectPixelShader.hlsl :

title : Spatial audio tutorials - 1 . Adding spatial audio to your project
# Adding spatial audio to your Unity project
Welcome to the spatial audio tutioral for Unity on HoloLens2 . This tutorial sequence shows :
* How to use HRTF offload on HoloLens 2 in Unity
* How to enable reverb when using HRTF offload
In this first chapter , you &apos;ll :
* Create a Unity project and import MRTK
* Import the Microsoft spatializer plugin
Start with an empty Unity project , then add and configure NuGet for Unity :
# # Add the Windows Mixed Reality package
# # Install MRTK and Microsoft Spatializer
# # Set up MRTK in your project
For additional guidance , including how to build your app and deploy to a HoloLens 2 , see &#91; Chapter 1 of the MR Learning Base Module &#93; ( mrlearning-base-ch1.md ) .
# # Enable spatial audio on your workstation
Continue on to &#91; Unity spatial audio chapter 2 &#93; ( unity-spatial-audio-ch2.md ) to spatialize button interaction sounds .
On HoloLens 2 , there are a number of ways to submit composition data through `xrEndFrame` which will result in post-processing that will have a noticeable performance penalty .
* Set the `XrCompositionLayerDepthInfoKHR` `minDepth` to 0.0f and `maxDepth` to 1.0f
title : MR Sharing 250 - HoloLens and immersive headsets
# MR Sharing 250 : HoloLens and immersive headsets
* * In this tutorial , we will : * *
* Setup a network using UNET .
* Share holograms across mixed reality devices .
* Create a shared experience where HoloLens users guide immersive headsets users through some simple puzzles .
* An Xbox controller that works with your PC .
* At least one HoloLens device and one immersive headset .
* A network which allows UDP Broadcast for discovery .
# # # What we will build
An application that shows a hologram on either HoloLens or a Windows Mixed Reality immersive headset .
* Open Unity .
* Check that Mixed Reality is enabled in Unity .
* Select * * Edit &gt; Player Settings * * .
* Check the * * Virtual Reality Supported * * box .
* Create a scene .
* Click * * Add Open Scenes . * *
* In the file explorer window that appears , create a New Folder named * * App * * .
* Press * * Select Folder . * *
* In the file explorer window that appears , navigate into the * * App * * folder .
# # # Digging into the code
# # # Enjoy your progress
Show how to handle input for a Windows Mixed Reality application .
* Add Virtual Playspace
* Type * * World Anchor Manager * * .
* Select * * World Anchor Manager * * to add it .
* Add TapToPlace to the Island
* Type * * Tap To Place * * and select it .
Note that both scripts have a common base class , BaseInputSource .
This time you can select the island to move it . On HoloLens you can move the island to a real surface . In the immersive headset you can move the island to the virtual table we added .
# # Chapter 3 - Sharing
* Remove Island and VRRoom
When a user creates a session , NetworkDiscoveryWithAnchors will call UNETAnchorManagers CreateAnchor function . Let &apos;s follow CreateAnchor flow .
In some cases the anchor won &apos;t export or will create so little data that we will try again . Here we just call CreateAnchor again .
A final function in the export path is AnchorFoundRemotely . When another device finds the anchor , that device will tell the host , and the host will use that as a signal that the anchor is a &quot; good anchor &quot; and can be cached .
When a HoloLens joins a session , it needs to import an anchor . In UNETAnchorManager &apos;s Update function , the AnchorName is polled . When the anchor name changes , the import process begins . First , we try to load the anchor with the specified name from the local anchor store . If we already have it , we can use it without downloading the data again . If we don &apos;t have it , then we call WaitForAnchor which will initiate the download .
* * Updated Input for the Immersive device : * *
* Type * * Mixed Reality Teleport * * and select it .
1 . You can see faces in the clouds , which helps an immersed user see which direction a HoloLens user is looking .
2 . The avatars on the island have necks that rotate . They won &apos;t follow what the user is doing is real reality ( we don &apos;t have that information ) but it makes for a nice experience .
3 . If the HoloLens user is looking at the Island , the immersed users can see their cursor .
4 . The clouds that represent the HoloLens users cast shadows .
# # Chapter 5 - Finale
Now let us look at LevelControl.cs. This script is the core of the game logic and maintains the game state . Since this is a multiplayer game using UNET we need to understand how data flows , at least well enough to modify this tutorial . For a more complete overview of UNET , please refer to Unity &apos;s documentation .
CheckGoal does some math to see if we are more or less standing on the pad . When we are , we Debug.Log &quot; Arrived at goal &quot; and then we call &apos; SendAtGoalMessage ( ) &apos; . In SendAtGoalMessage we call playerController.SendAtGoal. To save you some time , here &apos;s the code :
# Case study - Scaling Datascape across devices with different performance
# # Transparency and overdraw
Our main rendering struggles dealt with transparency , since transparency can be expensive on a GPU .
For HoloLens and mainstream PCs , the screen can only be filled a handful of times , making transparent rendering problematic .
* * Shader for creating the vertices : * *
# # Solid particle clouds
We now had a backup solution that produced a decent representation of our cloud data , but was a bit lackluster in the “ wow ” factor and did not convey the volumetric feel that we wanted for our high-end machines .
We used * DrawProcedural * to render a quad per particle allowing the particle data to stay on the GPU at all times .
* * Shader code showing the distribution : * *
Since we sort the particles front-to-back and we still used a solid style shader to clip ( not blend ) transparent pixels , this technique handles a surprising amount of particles , avoiding costly over-draw even on the lower-powered machines .
# # Transparent particle clouds
# # Render off-screen with lower resolution
* * Code for rendering off-screen : * *
# # Sharpening the edges
* * Code demonstrating an append buffer : * *
* Compute shader : *
Targeting a variety of hardware is challenging and requires some planning .
# Release notes - October 2018
* * * New apps and ways to launch content in the mixed reality home * *
* New * WebVR Showcase * app for discovering a regularly-curated selection of WebVR experiences .

* * * PIN sign-in on profile switch from sign-in screen * * - PIN sign-in is now available for &quot; Other User &quot; at the sign-in screen .
# # # For international customers
You may notice the following issues when using the Windows 10 October 2018 Update on your HoloLens :
Your app also needs to respond to * * CameraRemoved * * events by releasing resources that were created for that camera .
Your app &apos;s content must be positioned in a &#91; spatial coordinate system &#93; ( coordinate-systems-in-directx.md ) to be rendered in the HolographicSpace . The system provides two primary frames of reference which you can use to establish a coordinate system for your holograms .
The spatial locator represents the Windows Mixed Reality device , and tracks the motion of the device and provides coordinate systems that can be understood relative to its location .
All reference frames are gravity aligned , meaning that the y axis points &quot; up &quot; with respect to the user &apos;s environment . Since Windows uses &quot; right-handed &quot; coordinate systems , the direction of the – z axis coincides with the &quot; forward &quot; direction the device is facing when the reference frame is created .
# # Respond to locatability changed events
1 . Configure the Unity UWP build settings :
- Wait for Managed Debugger ( optional )
1 . Debug - &gt; Attach Unity Debugger .
1 . Select your device in the list and click &quot; OK &quot; to attach .

title : Adaptive Cards Template Service
# Adaptive Cards Template Service
&gt; Please read this for an &#91; overview of Adaptive Card Templating &#93; ( index.md )
# # How does the service help me ?
Let &apos;s say I just got a piece of data , maybe it &apos;s financial data , Microsoft Graph data , schema.org data , or custom data from within my organization .
Now I want to display the data to a user .
But what if there were a world where my app could &quot; learn &quot; new UI templates based on the type of data ? A world where anyone could contribute , enhance , and share common UI templates , within their own projects , within an organization , or for the entire internet .
# # What is the card template service ?
The card template service is a simple REST endpoint that helps :
* * * Find * * a template by analyzing the structure of your data
* * * Populate * * a template on the server , when client-side data binding isn &apos;t appropriate or possible
* A shared , open-source template repository backed by GitHub . * ( The repo is currently private but will be made public as soon as we tie up some loose ends ) *
* All the templates are flat JSON files in the repo , which makes editing , contributing , and sharing a natural part of a developer workflow .
# # Using the service
# # # Get all templates
# # # Find a template
First I want to see if a template exists for this type of data , so I make an HTTP request to the ` / find` endpoint with my data in the `POST body` .
# # # Get a template
A template retrieved from this endpoint can be populated with data at runtime &#91; using the templatng SDKs &#93; ( sdk.md ) .
You can also include &quot; sample data &quot; with the template , which makes editing in the designer more friendly :
Let &apos;s get the Microsoft Graph profile template that was returned from ` / find` above .
# # # Populate a template server-side
Let &apos;s populate the Microsoft Graph profile template that was returned from ` / find` using the data above .
Our hope is that by using GitHub as a backing store for the templates , we can &quot; democratize &quot; the process of authoring , enhancing , and sharing templates . Anyone can submit a Pull Request that includes an entirely new template , or make enhancements to existing ones ... all within the developer-friendly experience of GitHub .
# # Self-hosting the service
Not all types of data are appropriate for the &quot; central &quot; Adaptive Cards template service hosted at `https : / / templates.adaptivecards.io` .
We want to make sure anyone can host the template service within your organization , so the source code is available on GitHub and can be easily deployed to your own Azure Function .
title : Render a card - Xamarin.Android SDK
# Render a card - Xamarin.Android
Here &apos;s how to render a card using the Xamarin.Android SDK .
# # Create Adaptive Card Object Instance from JSON Text
# # Render a card
* context : Obtainable from the Activity the card is hosted in
* fragmentManager : can also be retrieved from the hosting activity
* cardActionHandler : instance of &#91; ```ICardActionHandler``` &#93; ( adaptivecards-renderin-xamarin-android-renderer-actionhandler-icardactionhandler.md ) to manage the action behaviour
The Android renderer can be extended to support multiple scenarios including :
# # Custom Parsing of Card Elements
Then the following lines demonstrate how to parse it into a CardElement that extends from the BaseCardElement :
# # Custom Rendering of Card Elements
&gt; * * List of Breaking Changes * *
# # # Breaking changes for v1.2
The ```render``` method was changed to include the ```RenderedAdaptiveCard``` parameter and ```ContainerStyle``` was changed for a RenderArgs where the ContainerStyle is now contained so a class that extends BaseCardElementRenderer should look like this
# # Custom Parsing of Card Actions
Next comes rendering the custom action
# # Custom Rendering of Actions
# # Custom rendering of actions
&gt; Changes to the custom rendering of actions are planned for v1.2 but are not completed yet
&gt; * * Only one IOnlineImageLoader can be registered and it takes precedence against the default way of retrieving images * *
Here &apos;s an example of an OnlineImageLoader which changes all images for a cat image
Finally , to register this image loader , you must only add this line to your code .
For v1.2 , the support for full ResourceResolvers was added to the android renderer . The implementation of a resource resolver is really similar to that of a IOnlineImageLoader but having ResourceResolvers allows a developer to add multiple ways to retrieve images from any kind of source in a single card , this is done by linking each ResourceResolver to a unique prefix which will be queried when trying to retrieve an image .
As mentioned previously , you can register multiple ResourceResolvers , to register a ResourceResolver you can do this
As you can see , the biggest changes are
# # Custom Media Loading
Once this class has been implemented , you can register your OnlineMediaLoader class by adding
By default , the actions will render as buttons on the card , but it &apos;s up to your app to make them behave as you expect . Each SDK has the equivalent of an `OnAction` event that you must handle .
An Adaptive Card is a JSON-serialized card object model .
* `AdaptiveCard` - The root object describes the AdaptiveCard itself , including its element makeup , its actions , how it should be spoken , and the schema version required to render it .
* `body` - The body of the card is made up of building-blocks known as `elements` . Elements can be composed in nearly infinite arrangements to create many types of cards .
Every element has a `type` property which identifies what kind of object it is . Looking at the above card , you can see we have two elements , a `TextBlock` and an `Image` .
Actions add buttons to the card . These can perform a variety of actions , like opening a URL or submitting some data .

# # Changing per element rendering
Developers can customize the look of renderred AdaptiveCards elements such as TextBlock .
Following example shows how one can change background color of NumberInput .
For example , in addition to &quot; spacing &quot; and &quot; id &quot; of json payload for BaseCardElement , one can add radius for corners of TextBlock to its json payload .
Developers can also have custom parsing and have new UI element added to adpative card such as progress bar . Please check CustomProgressBarRenderer.mm for detail .
Custom parser must implement ACOIBaseCardElementParser protocol. deserializeToCustomElement method should parses given json payload given as NSData and return a pointer to UIView object that will be added to AdaptiveCard rendered object .

title : Adaptive Cards Roadmap
While we have made excellent progress defining adaptive cards , there is still lots of work to do . Our hope is that through active developer communities like botness , and great partners like Slack and Kik , we can create a great ecosystem of cross-platform cards .
# # # Make cards responsive
* Hide content or collapse content to smaller size .
* Add a threshold that , when exceeded , changes `columnSet` to carousel of columns .

Imagine a world where a template and data can be combined * * directly on the client * * . This means if you use the same template multiple times , or want to update it with new data , you just need to send new data to the device and it can re-use the same template over and over .
# # # It helps you create a great looking card from just the data you provide
By separating data from content it opens a door for AI and other services to &quot; reason &quot; over the data in the cards we see and enhance user productivity or help us find things .

The following example shows how you could define a custom ` &quot; type &quot; : &quot; Rating &quot; ` element and render it .
title : Adaptive Cards Template Language
# Adaptive Cards Template Language
Writing a template is as simple as replacing the &quot; non-static &quot; content of your card with &quot; binding expressions &quot; .
# # # Static card payload
* Graceful null handling ensures you won &apos;t get exceptions if you access a null property in an object graph
# # Providing the data
# # # Option A : Inline data
# # # Option B : Separating the template from the data
Alternatively ( and more likely ) , you &apos;ll create a re-usable card template without including the data . This template could be stored as a file and added to source control .
Then load it up and provide the data at runtime using the &#91; Templating SDKs &#93; ( sdk.md ) .
# # # Assigning a data context to elements
To assign a &quot; data context &quot; to any element add a ` $ data` attribute to the element .
# # Repeating items in an array
* * This is just a small sampling of the built-in functions . * *
This is an Azure DevOps response where the `message` property is a JSON-serialized string . In order to access values within the string , we need to use the `json` function in our template .
Custom functions are supported via APIs in the &#91; Templating SDKs &#93; ( sdk.md ) .
# # Conditional layout with ` $ when`
Currently there is no support for composing template &quot; parts &quot; together . But we are exploring options and hope to share more soon . Any thoughts here welcome !
# Native styling - UWP
UWP makes this easy by allowing you to pass a ResourceDictionary for fine-grained styling , behavior , animations , etc .

An `AdaptiveCard` consists of a `body` and `actions` . The `body` is a collection of `CardElement`s that a renderer will enumerate and render in order .
# # # Spacing and Separators
# # # # Formatting functions
* TODO : What should the defaults be ? Should they all share it ? Should we embed a common hostConfig.json file in the binaries ?
* TODO : I think HostConfig needs to be versioned as well for parsing ?
&#91; `HostConfig` &#93; ( host-config.md ) is a shared configuration object that specifies how an Adaptive Card Renderer generates UI .
# # # Native platform styling
Action &#124; Behavior
* * Action.ShowCard * * &#124; Requests a sub-card to be shown to the user .
The Submit Action behaves like an HTML form submit , except that where HTML typically triggers an HTTP post , Adaptive Cards leaves it up to each host app to determine what &quot; submit &quot; means to them .
We do not make any promises of input validation in adaptive cards , so it &apos;s up to the receiving party to properly parse the response . E.g. , a Input.Number could return &quot; hello &quot; and they need to be prepared for that .
&#124; Actions &#124; The Actions to show in the card ’ s action bar . &#124;
&#124; BackgroundImage &#124; Specifies the background image of the card . &#124;
&#124; Body &#124; The card elements to show in the primary card region . &#124;
&#124; ElementType &#124; Must be &quot; AdaptiveCard &quot; . &#124;
&#124; FallbackText &#124; Text shown when the client doesn ’ t support the version specified ( may contain markdown ) . &#124;
&#124; Language &#124; The 2-letter ISO-639-1 language used in the card . Used to localize any date / time functions . &#124;
&#124; MinHeight &#124; Specifies the minimum height of the card . &#124;
&#124; SelectAction &#124; An Action that will be invoked when the card is tapped or selected . Action.ShowCard is not supported . &#124;
&#124; Speak &#124; Specifies what should be spoken for this entire card . This is simple text or SSML fragment . &#124;
&#124; Style &#124; &#124;
&#124; Version &#124; Schema version that this card requires . If a client is lower than this version , the fallbackText will be rendered . NOTE : Version is not required for cards within an Action.ShowCard. However , it is required for the top-level card . &#124;
&#124; VerticalContentAlignment &#124; Defines how the content should be aligned vertically within the container . Only relevant for fixed-height cards , or cards with a minHeight specified . &#124;
&#124; body &#124; ```AdaptiveCards.Rendering.Xamarin.Android.ObjectModel.BaseCardElementVector``` &#124;
&#124; actions &#124; ```AdaptiveCards.Rendering.Xamarin.Android.ObjectModel.BaseActionElementVector``` &#124;
Deserializes the given adaptive card as a json string for the specified renderer version using a &#91; ParseContext &#93; ( ) object to handle custom element parsing .
&#124; ```AdaptiveCards.Rendering.Xamarin.Android.ObjectModel.AdaptiveCard``` &#124; Adaptive card that contains the fallback text for an unrendereable card &#124;
Serializes the adaptive card into it &apos;s json string form .
&#124; ```string``` &#124; Adaptive card as a json string &#124;
Serializes the adaptive card into a json value object .

title : Dev lang completion - Docs Authoring Pack
Contributors need assistance determining the valid language identifiers ( dev langs ) that can follow triple-backticks ( code fence openings ) in a Markdown file . Unfortunately , build-time validation of dev langs doesn &apos;t exist . The result is disparate representations of a single language within the same conceptual docset .
* The code fence is closed .
# # # Display commonly used dev langs
1 . Select * * File * * &gt; * * Preferences * * &gt; * * Settings * * and filter by * Docs Markdown Extension * .
1 . Add the following `markdown.docsetLanguages` property to the * settings.json * file :
1 . Add dev lang names to the array until you &apos;re satisfied with the list . For example , the following list will display four dev lang names to the user after typing triple-ticks :
1 . Save your changes to the * settings.json * file .
&gt; An empty `markdown.docsetLanguages` array causes all known dev langs to display .
# # # Display all known dev langs

title : Set up Git repository locally
# Set up Git repository locally for documentation
&gt; * Determine the appropriate repository
&gt; * Fork the repository to your GitHub account
&gt; * Clone the repository to your local machine
&gt; * Configure the upstream remote value
For example , these popular repositories are available for public contributions :
# # Fork the repository
Using the appropriate repository , create a fork of the repository into your own GitHub account by using the GitHub website .
1 . Go to the main repository &apos;s GitHub page and click the * * Fork * * button on the upper right .
2 . If you are prompted , select your GitHub account tile as the destination where the fork should be created . This prompt creates a copy of the repository within your GitHub account , known as a fork .
# # Choose a local folder
Make a local folder to hold a copy of the repository locally . Some of the repositories can be large ; up to 5 GB for azure-docs for example . Choose a location with available disk space .
To determine the current directory , type `pwd` at the $ prompt .
# # Create a local clone
Using Git Bash , prepare to run the * * clone * * command to pull a copy of a repository ( your fork ) down to your device on the current directory .
# # # Authenticate by using Git Credential Manager
If you installed the latest version of Git for Windows and accepted the default installation , Git Credential Manager is enabled by default . Git Credential Manager makes authentication much easier because you don &apos;t need to recall your personal access token when re-establishing authenticated connections and remotes with GitHub .
1 . Run the * * clone * * command , by providing the repository name . Cloning downloads ( clone ) the forked repository on your local computer .
&gt; You can get your fork &apos;s GitHub URL for the clone command from the * * Clone or download * * button in the GitHub UI :
2 . When you &apos;re prompted , enter your GitHub credentials .
# # Configure remote upstream
Example remote output is shown . A fictitious git account named MyGitAccount is configured with a personal access token to access the repo azure-docs :

title : GitHub contribution workflow for major or long-running changes
# GitHub contribution workflow for major or long-running changes
This workflow is suitable for a contributor who needs to make a major change or will be a frequent contributor to a repository . Frequent contributors typically have ongoing ( long-running ) changes , which go through multiple build / validation / staging cycles or span multiple days before pull request sign-off and merge .
&#124; fork &#124; Normally used as a noun , when referring to a copy of a main GitHub repository . In practice , a fork is just another repository . But it &apos;s special in the sense that GitHub maintains a connection back to the main / parent repository . It &apos;s sometimes used as a verb , as in &quot; You must fork the repository first . &quot; &#124;
In this workflow , changes flow in a repetitive cycle . Starting from your device &apos;s local repository , they flow back up to your GitHub fork , into the main GitHub repository , and back down locally again as you incorporate changes from other contributors .
# # # Use GitHub flow
# # Making your changes
# # Saving changes to your repository
Before sending your changes to the author , you must first save them to your Github repository . Again , while all tools are different , if you &apos;re using the Git Bash command line , this can be done in just a few easy steps .
Next , you need to commit your saved changes to your local repository . This can be done in Git Bash by running :
Finally , since you created this branch on your local computer , you need to let the fork in your GitHub.com account know about it . If you &apos;re using Git Bash , this can be done by running :
You &apos;ve done it ! Your code is now up in your GitHub repository and ready for you to create a pull request .
That &apos;s it ! You &apos;ve made a contribution to docs.microsoft.com content !

title : Metadata Updates - Docs Authoring Pack
# # Update `ms.date` metadata value
Selecting the * * Update `ms.date` Metadata Value * * option will set the current Markdown files `ms.date` value to today &apos;s date . If the document does not have an `ms.date` metadata field , no action is taken .
In this case , all Markdown files would implicitly take on the `ms.author : dapine` metadata value . The feature acts on these implicit settings found in the * docfx.json * file . If a Markdown file contains metadata with values that are explicitly set to something other than the implicit values , they are overridden .
If the * * Update implicit metadata values * * option was executed on this file , with the assumed * docfx.json * content from above the metadata value would be updated to `ms.author : dapine` .
title : Contribute to the .NET docs repositories
# Learn how to contribute to the .NET docs repositories
Thank you for your interest in contributing to the .NET documentation !
# # Guidelines for contributions
- * * DON &apos;T * * surprise us with large pull requests . Instead , file an issue and start a discussion so we can agree on a direction before you invest a large amount of time .
- * * DO * * create a separate branch on your fork before working on the articles .
- * * DO * * blog and tweet ( or whatever ) about your contributions , frequently !
# # Make a contribution to .NET docs
The content inside the * * docs * * folder is organized into sections that are reflected in the Table of Contents ( TOC ) . Define where the topic will be located in the TOC . Get feedback on your proposal .
- * * Content updates * * . Given the enormity of the doc set , content easily becomes outdated and requires revision . In addition , for a variety of reason , some content has been duplicated or even triplicated . Updating content involves making sure that individual topics are current or revising content in a feature area to eliminate duplication and ensure that all unique content is preserved in the smaller documentation set .
* * Step 3 : * * Make the changes on this new branch .
If it &apos;s a new topic , you can use this &#91; template file &#93; ( dotnet-style-guide.md ) as your starting point . It contains the writing guidelines and also explains the metadata required for each article , such as author information .
For images and other static resources , create a subfolder called * * media * * inside the folder that contains your article , if it doesn &apos;t already exist . Inside the * * media * * folder , create a subfolder with the article name ( except for the index file ) .
Be sure to follow the proper Markdown syntax . For examples of common , see the &#91; template and markdown cheatsheet &#93; ( dotnet-style-guide.md ) .
For historical reasons , many of the included snippets are stored under the * / samples * folder in the * dotnet / docs * repository . If you are making major changes to an article , those snippets should be moved to the new structure . Do not move snippets for small changes .
The .NET team will review your PR and let you know if there are any other updates / changes necessary in order to approve it .
* * Step 5 : * * Make any necessary updates to your branch as discussed with the team .
# # Contributing to samples
Your topic will also contain links to the sample . Link directly to the sample &apos;s folder on GitHub .
# # # Writing a new sample
- Additionally , we prefer the use of `static` methods rather than instance methods when demonstrating something that doesn &apos;t require instantiating a new object .
We will have a CI system in place to build these projects shortly .
3 . Write your sample ( example : `WhereClause-Sample1.cs` ) .
1 . Go to the sample folder and build to check for errors :
3 . Add a readme.md to the root directory of your sample .

title : Docs Style guide - Quick start
# Docs style and voice quick start
- Check the spelling and grammar in your articles , even if you have to copy and paste into Microsoft Word to check .
- * * Focus on the intent * * : Customers have a specific purpose in mind when they consult our documentation . Before you begin writing , clearly determine who the customer is and what task he or she is trying to do . Then , write your article to help that specific customer do that specific task .
- * * Use everyday words * * : Try to use natural language , the words your customers use . Be less formal but not less technical . Provide examples that explain new concepts .
- * * Write concisely * * : Don &apos;t waste words . Be affirmative and don &apos;t use extra words or lots of qualifiers . Keep sentences short and concise . Keep your article focused . If a task has a qualifier , put it at the beginning of the sentence or paragraph . Also , keep the number of notes to a minimum . Use a screenshot when it can save words .
# # Consider localization and machine translation
- * * Use simple and consistent sentence construction * * : Consistency is better for translation . Avoid parentheticals and asides , and have the subject as near the beginning of the sentence as possible . Check out a few published articles . If an article has a friendly , easy-to-read style , use it as a model .
- * * Use consistent wording and capitalization * * : Again , consistency is key . Do not capitalize a word if it isn &apos;t at the start of a sentence or it isn &apos;t a proper noun .
# # Other style and voice issues to watch for
- Use &quot; sign in &quot; and not &quot; log in . &quot;
title : Sort Redirects - Docs Authoring Pack
With the evolution of a docs.microsoft.com docset , some Markdown files eventually will be deleted . When a Markdown file is deleted , we &apos;re required to provide a redirect so that any reference to the deleted article is properly resolved via the redirect . Redirections are specified in the * .openpublishing.redirection.json * file .
1 . Type : * * Docs : Sort master redirection file * *
1 . Select the command to execute it
# Docs Authoring Pack for VS Code
Some syntax supported by the extension , such as alerts and snippets , are custom Markdown for OPS . Custom Markdown will not render correctly unless published via OPS .
# # How to generate a master redirect file
2 . Start typing &quot; Docs : Generate ... &quot;
5 . Review the results . If they are as expected , submit a pull request to update the repo .
# # How to assign keyboard shortcuts
1 . Click the plus that appears near the command name when you mouse over the line .
1 . It &apos;s a good idea to insert a `when` clause into your key binding , so it won &apos;t be available in files other than Markdown . To do this , open * keybindings.json * and insert the following line below the command name ( be sure to add a comma between lines ) :
Your completed custom key binding should look like this in * keybindings.json * :
1 . Select * * User Settings * * to change the settings for all VS Code workspaces or * * Workspace Settings * * to change them for just the current workspace .
1 . Select * * Extensions * * &gt; * * Docs Markdown Extension Configuration * * , and then select * * Show the legacy toolbar in the bottom status bar * * .
Once you &apos;ve made your selection , VS Code updates the * settings.json * file . You will then be prompted to reload the window for the changes to take effect .
# # How to use Docs templates
1 . Ensure the Docs Article Templates extension is installed and enabled .
1 . Select the desired template from the list that appears .
The Templates extension supports three dynamic metadata fields : author , ms.author , and ms.date. That means that if a template creator uses these fields in the metadata header of a Markdown template , they will be auto-populated in your file when you apply the template , as follows :
&#124; Metadata field &#124; Value &#124;
&#124; `author` &#124; Your GitHub alias , if specified in your VS Code settings file . &#124;
&#124; `ms.author` &#124; Your Microsoft alias , if specified in your VS Code settings file . If you are not a Microsoft employee , leave unspecified . &#124;
&#124; `ms.date` &#124; The current date in the Docs-supported format , `MM / DD / YYYY` . The date is not automatically updated if you subsequently update the file - you must update it manually . This field is used to indicate the &quot; article freshness &quot; . &#124;
1 . In the Default Settings pane on the left , find * * Docs Article Templates Extension Configuration * * , click the pencil icon next to the desired setting , then click Replace in Settings .
1 . The * * User * * settings pane will open side by side , with a new entry at the bottom .
1 . You might need to close and restart VS Code for the changes to take effect .
1 . Draft your template as a Markdown file .
The docs.microsoft.com team will review your template and merge the PR if it meets docs.microsoft.com style guidelines . Once merged , the template will be available to all users of the Docs Article Templates extension .
Here &apos;s a short video that demonstrates the following features of the Docs Authoring Pack :
* Support for &quot; Docs : Link to file in repo &quot;
* Update &quot; ms.date &quot; Metadata Value context menu option
* Unrecognized code-fence language identifier warnings / auto correction support
* Sort selection descending ( Z to A )
Explore the various features available in the Docs Authoring Pack , Visual Studio Code extension .
# # Pull request processing
- * * Labeling * * : Labels are automatically applied to your pull request , to indicate the state of your pull request as it passes through the validation workflow . For instance , new pull requests might automatically receive the &quot; do-not-merge &quot; label , indicating that the pull request has not yet completed the validation , review , and sign-off steps .
- * * Auto-merge * * : The pull request might be automatically merged , if it passes validation testing and certain criteria . In this case , you don &apos;t need to take any further action .
# # # Review and sign-off
Several of the Microsoft documentation sets are open source and hosted on GitHub . Not all document sets are completely open source but many have public-facing repos where you can make suggested changes via pull requests . This open source approach streamlines and improves communication between product engineers , content teams , and customers , and has other advantages :
# # Quick edits to existing documents
1 . Some docs pages allow you to edit content directly in the browser . If so , you &apos;ll see an * * Edit * * button like the one shown below . Clicking the * * Edit * * ( or equivalently localized ) button takes you to the source file on GitHub . If the * * Edit * * button is missing , that means the documentation page is not available to be changed .
2 . Next , click the pencil icon , to edit the article as shown . If the pencil icon is grayed out , you need to either log in to your GitHub account or create a new account .
3 . Make your changes in the web editor . Click the * * Preview changes * * tab to check the formatting of your change .
6 . That &apos;s it ! Content team members will review and merge your PR . You may get some feedback requesting changes if you made larger changes .
We use pull requests for all changes , even for contributors that have write-access . Most repositories have the `master` branch protected so that updates must be submitted as pull requests .
The in-browser editing experience is best for minor or infrequent changes . If you make large contributions or use advanced Git features ( such as branch management or advanced merge conflict resolution ) , you need to &#91; fork the repo and work locally &#93; ( how-to-write-workflows-major.md ) .
# # Review open PRs
# # Create quality issues
Many of Microsoft &apos;s documentation pages have a * * Feedback * * section at the bottom of the page where you can click to leave * * Product feedback * * or * * Content feedback * * to track issues that are specific to that article .
Issues start the conversation about what &apos;s needed . The content team will respond to these issues with ideas for what we can add , and ask for your opinions . When we create a draft , we &apos;ll ask you to &#91; review the PR &#93; ( # review-open-prs ) .
# # Get more involved
# Labels and projects roadmap
You can combine a label from each set ( guide , release , priority ) to create a narrow focus to find issues you want to work on .
# # # Find a single .NET guide

title : Computer Vision
Cognitive Services is comprised of 5 categories : Vision , Speech , Languages , Knowledge , and Search .
The Vision category , the most valuable category for computer vision applications , contains four APIs : Computer Vision , Emotion , Face , and Video . These APIs provide the following functionality :
Cognitive Services is great for working with large amount of data , accessing Microsoft Azure , and greatly reducing you application &apos;s time-to-market , as the Vision APIs often prove to be time-consuming to develop independently . The model used for these APIs is well-trained and extensive thanks to the efforts of Microsoft Research . On the other hand , its cloud connectivity requirement reduces system performance and creates the requirement for an internet connection .
To employ Cognitive Services , users must sign up at the Congitive Services website to receive API keys . After providing an API key to Cognitive Services , users can call the APIs within the limitations mentioned in the &quot; Pricing &quot; section .
All Cognitive Services APIs can be implemented on any hardware platform using C # .
OpenCV features :
- Real time object identification , matching , and tracking
- Image editing ( such as composition and color change )
This is currently a work in progress , so keep checking WindowsOnDevices.com for updates !

An understanding of the boot order on a Windows 10 IoT Core device is needed before we can delve into the individual components that provide a secure platform for the IoT device .
* Unified Extensible Firmware Interface ( UEFI ) Secure Boot
* Windows Code Integrity
In order to lockdown a Windows IoT device , the following considerations must be made .
# # # UEFI Secure Boot
UEFI Secure Boot is the first policy enforcement point , and is located in UEFI . It restricts the system to only allow execution of binaries signed by a specified authority , such as firmware drivers , option ROMs , UEFI drivers or applications , and UEFI boot loaders . This feature prevents unknown code from being executed on the platform and potentially weakening the security posture of it . Secure Boot reduces the risk of pre-boot malware attacks to the device , such as rootkits .
Here are the steps taken by UEFI Secure Boot :
2 . If the firmware isn &apos;t trusted , UEFI firmware initiates OEM-specific recovery to restore trusted firmware .
# # # Windows Code Integrity
Windows Code Integrity ( WCI ) improves the security of the operating system by validating the integrity of a driver or application each time it is loaded into memory . CI contains two main components - Kernel Mode Code Integrity ( KMCI ) and User Mode Code Integrity ( UMCI ) .
Configurable Code Integrity ( CCI ) is a feature in Windows 10 that allows device builders to lockdown a device and only allow it to run and execute code that is signed and trusted . To do so , device builders can create a code integrity policy on a &apos; golden &apos; device ( final release version of hardware and software ) and then secure and apply this policy on all devices on the factory floor .
Here are the steps taken by Windows Code Integrity :
1 . Windows Kernel will verify all other components against the signature database before loading . This includes drivers , startup files and ELAM ( Early Launch Anti-Malware ) .
# # # BitLocker Device Encryption
* Setup and configuration of device encryption using BitLocker
# # # Development IoT Devices
&gt; Raspberry Pi 2 nor 3 do not support TPM and so we cannot configure Lockdown scenarios .
# # # Generate Lockdown Packages
3 . Mount your reference hardware platform ( running the unlocked image ) to your PC via network share using
4 . Generate keys for your device using
* * * Secure your generated keys * * as the device will trust binaries signed with these keys only after lockdown .
* General section : Specify the package directories
* Tools section : Set the path for the tools
* SIPolicy section : Specify certs that should be trusted
* Update : Signer of the SIPolicy ( PAUTH keys )
* User : User mode certificates ( UMCI keys )
* Kernel : Kernel mode certificates ( KMCI keys )
* Packaging : Specify the settings for the package generation
6.Execute the following commands to generate required packages :
# # # Test Lockdown packages
1 . Flash the device with the unlocked image ( image used for scanning in earlier step ) .
4 . Initiate staging of the generated packages by issueing the following commands
6 . The device will reboot into update OS ( showing gears ) to install the packages and will reboot again to main OS . Once the device reboots back into MainOS , Secure Boot will be enabled and SIPolicy should be engaged .
7 . Reboot the device again to activate the Bitlocker encryption .
8 . Test the security features
* SecureBoot : try `bcdedit / debug on` , you will get an error stating that the value is protected by secure boot policy
* DeviceGuard : Run any unsigned binary or a binary signed with certificate not in the SIPolicy list and confirm that it fails to run .
# # # Generate Lockdown image
2 . Add RetailOEMInput.xml and TestOEMInput.xml under the ProductName directory with lockdown package feature ID
3 . Re-generate Image
4 . Flash the device with this new Flash.ffu and validate the security features .

title : Background Applications
Background applications are applications that have no direct UI . Once deployed and configured , these applications launch at machine startup and run continuously without any process lifetime management resource use limitations . If they crash or exit the system will automatically restart them .
These Background Applications have a very simple execution model . The templates create a class that implements the &quot; IBackgroundTask &quot; interface and generates the empty &quot; Run &quot; method . This &quot; Run &quot; method is the entry point to your application .
# # What languages are available ?
When the Run method ends , unless a deferral object is created , the background application ends . The common practice , for asynchronous programming is to take a deferral like this :
# # How do background applications start ?
To deploy a background application , you can either :
To invoke a background application , you can either :
* As mentioned above , Visual Studio &apos;s F5 functionality will deploy and immediately start your Background Application .

In 1994 , Peter Shor showed that a scalable quantum computer could break widely used encryption techniques such as the RSA algorithm . Classical cryptography relies on the intractability of problems such as integer factorization or discrete logarithms , many of which can be solved more efficiently using quantum computers .
In 1996 , Lov Grover developed a quantum algorithm that dramatically sped up the solution to unstructured data searches , running the search in fewer steps than any classical algorithm could .

# File Permissions for WSL
When accessing Windows files from WSL the file permissions are either calculated from Windows permissions , or are read from metadata that has been added to the file by WSL . This metadata is not enabled by default .
# # WSL metadata on Windows files
When metadata is enabled as a mount option in WSL , extended attributes on Windows NT files can be added and interpreted to supply Linux file system permissions .
WSL can add four NTFS extended attributes :
&#124; Attribute Name &#124; Description &#124;
&#124; $ LXUID &#124; User Owner ID &#124;
&#124; $ LXGID &#124; Group Owner ID &#124;
&#124; $ LXMOD &#124; File mode ( File systems permission octals and type , e.g : 0777 ) &#124;
&#124; $ LXDEV &#124; Device , if it is a device file &#124;
Below is a description of how permissions are determined when accessing files in different ways using the Windows Subsystem for Linux .
# # # # Reading file permissions from an existing Windows file
# # # # # The file has metadata
If the file has metadata present , we simply use those metadata values instead of translating effective permissions of the Windows user .
# # # # # Metadata is not enabled ( default )
# # # # # Metadata is enabled
# # # # # User file does not have metadata ( default )
# # # # # User file has metadata
The default umask is applied when creating a new file inside of a WSL distribution from Windows . The default umask is `022` , or in other words it allows all permissions except write permissions to groups and others .
# # Configuring file permissions
You can configure your file permissions inside of your Windows drives using the mount options in wsl.conf. The mount options allow you to set `umask` , `dmask` and `fmask` permissions masks . The `umask` is applied to all files , the `dmask` is applied just to directories and the `fmask` is applied just to files . These permission masks are then put through a logical OR operation when being applied to files , e.g : If you have a `umask` value of `023` and an `fmask` value of `022` then the resulting permissions mask for files will be `023` .

# # Use the Linux file system for faster performance
In order to optimize for the fastest performance speed , be sure to store your project files in the Linux file system ( not the Windows file system ) .
For example , when storing your WSL project files :
Project files that you are working with using a WSL distribution ( like Ubuntu ) must be in the Linux root file system to take advantage of faster file system access .
* Your project files must be stored in the Windows file system .
* A project which requires cross-compilation using both Windows and Linux tools on the same files .
A traditional VM experience can be slow to boot up , is isolated , consumes lots of resources , and requires your time to manage it . WSL 2 does not have these attributes .
# # # Full Linux kernel
# # # Full system call compatibility
* Any updates to the Linux kernel are immediately ready for use . ( You don &apos;t have to wait for the WSL team to implement updates and add the changes ) .
# # Accessing network applications
To find the IP address of the virtual machine powering your Linux distribution :
* From your WSL distribution ( ie Ubuntu ) , run the command : `ip addr`
* Find and copy the address under the `inet` value of the `eth0` interface .
* If you have the grep tool installed , find this more easily by filtering the output with the command : `ip addr &#124; grep eth0`
* Connect to your Linux server using this IP address .
- Copy the IP address following the term : `nameserver` .
The picture below shows an example of this by connecting to a Node.js server running in Windows via curl .
# # # Additional networking considerations
# # # # Connecting via remote IP addresses
When using remote IP addresses to connect to your applications , they will be treated as connections from the Local Area Network ( LAN ) . This means that you will need to make sure your application can accept LAN connections .
When using a WSL 1 distribution , if your computer was set up to be accessed by your LAN , then applications run in WSL could be accessed on your LAN as well .
This isn &apos;t the default case in WSL 2 . WSL 2 has a virtualized ethernet adapter with its own unique IP address . Currently , to enable this workflow you will need to go through the same steps as you would for a regular virtual machine . ( We are looking into ways to improve this experience . )
# # # # IPv6 access
WSL 2 distributions currently cannot reach IPv6-only addresses . We are working on adding this feature .
# # Expanding the size of your WSL 2 Virtual Hardware Disk
To expand your maximum VHD size beyond 256GB :
1 . Terminate all WSL instances using the command : `wsl --shutdown`
2 . Find your distribution installation package name ( &apos; PackageFamilyName &apos; )
* Using PowerShell ( where &apos; distro &apos; is your distribution name ) enter the command :
3 . Locate the VHD file `fullpath` used by your WSL 2 installation , this will be your `pathToVHD` :
4 . Resize your WSL 2 VHD by completing the following commands :
* Open Windows Command Prompt with admin privileges and enter :
5 . Launch your WSL distribution ( Ubuntu , for example ) .
6 . Make WSL aware that it can expand its file system &apos;s size by running these commands from your Linux distribution command line :
* Use the value you copied earlier . You may also need to install resize2fs : `apt install resize2fs`
&gt; In general do not modify , move , or access the WSL related files located inside of your AppData folder using Windows tools or editors . Doing so could cause your Linux distribution to become corrupted .
# Install Windows Subsystem for Linux
# # Enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux optional feature

Git comes already installed with most of the Windows Subsystem for Linux distributions , however , you may want to update to the latest version . You also will need to set up your git config file .
For the latest stable GIt version in Ubuntu / Debian , enter the command :
To set up your Git config file , open a command line for the distribution you &apos;re working in and set your name with this command ( replacing &quot; Your Name &quot; with your Git username ) :
Set your email with this command ( replacing &quot; youremail @ domain.com &quot; with the email you use on your Git account ) :
# # Git Credential Manager setup
To set up Git Credential Manager for use with a WSL distribution , open your distribution and enter this command :
Now any git operation you perform within your WSL distribution will use the credential manager . If you already have credentials cached for a host , it will access them from the credential manager . If not , you &apos;ll receive a dialog response requesting your credentials , even if you &apos;re in a Linux console .

# # Install VS Code and the Remote WSL extension
Some WSL Linux distributions are lacking libraries that are required by the VS Code server to start up . You can add additional libraries into your Linux distribution by using its package manager .
For example , to update Debian or Ubuntu , use :
To add wget ( to retrieve content from web servers ) and ca-certificates ( to allow SSL-based applications to check for the authenticity of SSL connections ) , enter :
To open a project from your WSL distribution , open the distribution &apos;s command line and enter : `code .`
# # Extensions inside of VS Code Remote
The Remote-WSL extension splits VS Code into a “ client-server ” architecture , with the client ( the user interface ) running on your Windows machine and the server ( your code , Git , plugins , etc ) running remotely .
When running VS Code Remote , selecting the &apos; Extensions &apos; tab will display a list of extensions split between your local machine and your WSL distribution .
For further information , see the VS Code docs :
# # Install Git ( optional )

# Frequently Asked Questions about Windows Subsystem for Linux
# # Who is WSL for ?
# # What can I do with WSL ?
# # What is Bash ?
# # How does this work ?
# # Why would I use , for example , Ruby on Linux instead of on Windows ?
Some cross-platform tools were built assuming that the environment in which they run behaves like Linux . For example , some tools assume that they are able to access very long file paths or that specific files / folders exist . This often causes problems on Windows which often behaves differently from Linux .
# # What does this mean for PowerShell ?
No ! WSL is a tool aimed at enabling users who need them to run Bash and core Linux command-line tools on Windows .
Windows Subsystem for Linux is available on the desktop version of Windows for Windows 10 Anniversary and Creators update or later .
Beginning in the Fall Creators update WSL will be available on both the desktop and server SKUs of Windows .
# # What processors does WSL support ?
WSL supports x64 and ARM CPUs .
# # Are files in the Linux drive different from the mounted Windows drive ?
* Files which contain invalid Windows filename characters
* Changing file attributes through chmod and chown
* File / folder case sensitivity
2 . Files in mounted drives are controlled by Windows and have the following behaviors :
* All permissions are set to best reflect the Windows permissions
# # Why are there so many errors when I run apt-get upgrade ?
Some packages use features that we haven &apos;t implemented yet . `udev` , for example , isn &apos;t supported yet and causes several `apt-get upgrade` errors .
To fix issues related to `udev` , follow the following steps :
3 . Run the following commands
# # How do I uninstall a WSL Distribution ?
On builds prior to 1709 ( 16299 ) open a command prompt and run :
# # Why does ping generate permission denied errors ?
In WSL builds &lt; 14926 , ping required WSL to run via an elevated Console . This issue was fixed in Build 14926 and later .
# # Why do I get &quot; Error : 0x80040306 &quot; when I try to install ?
1 . Right click title bar - &gt; Properties - &gt; Uncheck &quot; Use legacy console &quot;
1 . Click OK
WSL install will try to automatically change the Ubuntu locale to match the locale of your Windows install . If you do not want this behavior you can run this command to change the Ubuntu locale after install completes . You will have to relaunch bash.exe for this change to take effect .
The below example changes to locale to en-US :
# # Why do I not have internet access from WSL ?
Some users have reported issues with specific firewall applications blocking internet access in WSL . The firewalls reported are :
In some cases turning off the firewall allows for access . In some cases simply having the firewall installed looks to block access .
# # How can I back up my WSL distros , or move them from one drive to another ?
Please note that traditional backup services that backup files in your Appdata folders ( like Windows Backup ) will not corrupt your Linux files .

Visio 2013 provides a powerful single platform for your custom drawing solutions . New objects , collections , properties , methods , enumerations , and events , along with new ShapeSheet cells and functions , give you more options for defining the behavior of the elements in your solutions .
The new file format includes the following file types ( by extension ) :
- .vsdx ( Visio drawing )
- .vsdm ( Visio macro-enabled drawing )
- .vssx ( Visio stencil )
- .vssm ( Visio macro-enabled stencil )
- .vstx ( Visio template )
- .vstm ( Visio macro-enabled template )
New shape effects such as bevel , 3-D rotation , glow , reflection , and sketching have been added to Visio 2013 . The ShapeSheet includes new cells for working with these affects .
&gt; Comments are no longer accessible through the ShapeSheet .
# # Customizable image clipping

title : &quot; Testing deployment &quot;
This topic describes some scenarios that you should test for regarding installing and uninstalling an Outlook Social Connector ( OSC ) provider .
Factors the affect installing an OSC provider includes the bitness of the operating system , the presence and bitness of Outlook , and the OSC being enabled in Outlook .
Before installing an OSC provider , the Outlook user should ensure that the OSC add-in is enabled in Outlook .
The recommended method of deploying an OSC provider is to use a Windows Installer ( .msi ) package . Test each of the following scenarios to verify deployment works appropriately for the provider .
# # Installed location and registry keys
# # # File location for OSC provider DLLs
Test for the scenarios as listed in the following table . Note that the table lists the default installation paths for OSC provider DLLs . Users can customize where they install these DLLs .
# # # Windows registry locations
# # Removing the installation
The following are some tests to verify that the uninstall process works properly for your OSC provider .
&#124; User chooses to uninstall the provider . &lt; br / &gt; &#124; The provider uninstalls the DLLs and clears the registry . &lt; br / &gt; &#124;
&#124; User chooses to cancel the uninstall process of the provider . &lt; br / &gt; &#124; The provider cancels the uninstall process and brings the user back to the state before the uninstall process started . &lt; br / &gt; &#124;

Success , warning , and error values are returned using a 32-bit number known as a result handle , or HRESULT . An HRESULT is really not a handle to anything ; it is merely a 32-bit value with several fields encoded in the value . A zero result indicates success and a nonzero result indicates failure .
MAPI on 32-bit platforms works solely with HRESULT values .
The following illustration shows the HRESULT format for 32-bit platforms .
The R , C , N , and r bits are reserved in the HRESULT .

When the OSC configures an account , you should verify whether the social network icon and name are displayed , and that the create-account and forgot-password hyperlinks appear in the account configuration dialog box as specified by the provider .
# # # Social network icon and name
# # # Showing hyperlinks in configuration dialog
# # # Support for forgotten password
Test for the following scenarios regardless of whether your OSC provider supports basic authentication or forms-based authentication .
&#124; Logging on for the first time . &lt; br / &gt; &#124; The user can successfully log on to the social network . &lt; br / &gt; &#124;

The user can trigger recalculation in Microsoft Excel in several ways , for example :
- Entering new data ( if Excel is in Automatic recalculation mode , described later in this topic ) .
- Explicitly instructing Excel to recalculate all or part of a workbook .
- Deleting or inserting a row or column .
- Saving a workbook while the * * Recalculate before save * * option is set .
- Performing certain Autofilter actions .
- Double-clicking a row or column divider ( in Automatic calculation mode ) .
- Adding , editing , or deleting a defined name .
- Renaming a worksheet .
- Hiding or unhiding rows , but not columns .
# # Dependence , Dirty Cells , and Recalculated Cells
1 . Construction of a dependency tree
2 . Construction of a calculation chain
3 . Recalculation of cells
After marking cells as dirty , when a recalculation is next done , Excel reevaluates the contents of each dirty cell in the order dictated by the calculation chain . In the example given earlier , this means B1 is first , and then C1 . This recalculation occurs immediately after Excel finishes marking cells as dirty if the recalculation mode is automatic ; otherwise , it occurs later .
# # Asynchronous User Defined Functions ( UDFs )
The following Excel functions are volatile :
# # Calculation Modes , Commands , Selective Recalculation , and Data Tables

# # Interacting with the Autocomplete Stream
The means of storing the autocomplete data differs between Outlook 2007 and Outlook 2010 or Outlook 2013 as follows :
For autocomplete operations , Outlook interacts exclusively with this in-memory structure for the duration of the outlook.exe process lifetime . Outlook only saves the structure on shutdown . See the following section &quot; Saving the Autocomplete Stream &quot; for more information on this process .
- A new nickname entry is added through resolving a name , picking a recipient from the address book dialog , or sending mail to a recipient that was not already in the list .
- An entry is removed by the user through the UI .
- Do not interact with the autocomplete stream while Outlook is running . If Outlook is running while you modify the stream , it will likely overwrite your changes when it shuts down .
- Only modify the properties of types that are from the row-set of the autocomplete stream . For more information about the autocomplete stream properties and property types , see &#91; Autocomplete Stream &#93; ( autocomplete-stream.md ) .

The CREATE INDEX statement has these parts :
In the optional WITH clause , you can enforce data validation rules . You can :
- Prohibit Null entries in the indexed field or fields of new records by using the DISALLOW NULL option .
- Designate the indexed field or fields as the primary key by using the PRIMARY reserved word . This implies that the key is unique , so you can omit the UNIQUE reserved word .
This example creates an index consisting of the fields Home Phone and Extension in the Employees table .
This example creates an index on the Customers table using the CustomerID field . No two records can have the same data in the CustomerID field , and no Null values are allowed .

# # Usage scenarios for the PSI
- * * Maintenance projects * * Create placeholder projects to use with resource plans . Reserve or book time against resources for maintenance work or base business . Maintenance projects generally do not have tasks .
# # What the PSI does not do
Although there are many things the PSI can do , there are some things the PSI does not do . Following are two things the PSI cannot do , but the CSOM can do .
# # # Project Online and remote event receivers
# # # Workflows and claims authentication
The following list are things that neither the PSI nor the CSOM can do .
# # # # Local data
- Manipulating data in local projects ( .mpp files ) . For example , defining cost rate tables or availability contours for local resources .
- Defining or editing local base calendars or resource calendars , including calendar exceptions .
- Defining local custom fields . ( The PSI does support editing local custom field values on tasks , resources , and assignments . )
# # # # Enterprise data
# # # # Master projects and cross-project links
- Creating master projects and inserting subprojects .
- Creating cross-project links .
- Requesting or performing resource leveling .
- Changing the resource on an assignment . ( You can use the PSI to delete the assignment and create a new one . )
- Deleting or replacing a resource that has actual work accepted ( actuals ) .
- Changing a resource type between work , material , and cost .
# # # # Work contours
- Editing timephased data .
- Setting or changing the assignment contour type ( such as flat , back-loaded , or front-loaded ) .
# # # # Baselines and earned value
- Saving a baseline or editing baseline data .
- Setting a progress date .
- Calculating variance and earned value .
# # # # Interactive scheduling
- Supporting interactive scheduling . ( Because Project Server handles interactions asynchronously , interactive scheduling should be done with Project Professional . )
- Defining a work breakdown structure ( WBS ) code mask .
- Changing the task type ( fixed work , duration , or units ) .
- Changing whether a task is effort-driven .
- Changing task fixed-cost accrual .
- Creating or editing recurring tasks .
# # # # Summary tasks
- Creating or changing assignments on summary tasks .
For the project summary task , the PSI limitations are the same as for Project Professional . The PSI can edit budget assignments — including cost budgets .

There are three methods of linking : implicit linking , explicit linking , and a new hybrid model using the MAPI Stub Library .
* * Comparison of implicit and explicit linking . * *
For more information about explicit linking , see Linking Explicitly .
1 . Load mapi32.dll from the appropriate system directory .
3 . Load the DLL by calling the LoadLibrary function .
4 . Initialize the MAPI function pointer array by calling the GetProcAddress function .
&gt; You must uninitialize the MAPI subsystem before closing your application .
An alternate method of incorporating the MAPI Stub Library is to copy the source files , MapiStubLibrary.cpp and StubUtils.cpp , directly into your project and remove any linkage to Mapi32.lib and any code that explicitly links to MAPI .

The LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN operations have these parts :
Use a LEFT JOIN operation to create a left outer join . Left outer joins include all of the records from the first ( left ) of two tables , even if there are no matching values for records in the second ( right ) table .
Use a RIGHT JOIN operation to create a right outer join . Right outer joins include all of the records from the second ( right ) of two tables , even if there are no matching values for records in the first ( left ) table .
For example , you could use LEFT JOIN with the Departments ( left ) and Employees ( right ) tables to select all departments , including those that have no employees assigned to them . To select all employees , including those who are not assigned to a department , you would use RIGHT JOIN .
The following example shows how you could join the Categories and Products tables on the CategoryID field . The query produces a list of all categories , including those that contain no products :
&gt; - You can link multiple ON clauses . See the discussion of clause linking in the INNER JOIN topic to see how this is done .
&gt; - If you try to join fields containing Memo or OLE Object data , an error occurs .
- Selects all departments , including those without employees .
- Calls the EnumFields procedure , which you can find in the SELECT statement example .

InfoPath forms with managed code can be published to the SharePoint sandboxed solution infrastructure from the InfoPath Designer . This topic provides two examples that show the kind of code that you can write in an InfoPath sandboxed solution , and how to publish the form template .
Perform the following steps to create a form template that sorts the data in a * * Repeating Table * * control on the form .
# # # To create a form template that programmatically sorts data in the form
5 . Publish your form by using the following steps :
# # # Designing the form and developing the code
4 . Populate the values in the combo box from the list by using the following steps :
1 . Select the combo box that you created in step 1 .
5 . Set the value and display name to Title .
If your form is not saved yet , you are prompted to save it . And then , the code editor window opens with the cursor in the `myCombo _ Changed` event handler .
7 . Paste the following code into the `myCombo _ Changed` event handler .
8 . The preceding code example depends on the `GetDomValue` helper function . Paste the following code for the `GetDomValue` helper function below the `myCombo _ Changed` event handler function .
9 . Publish your form by using the following steps :
7 . After the form is successfully published , open the form from the form library and add a new value into the combo box to test the code . When you exit the myCombo field , the new value will be written to the SharePoint list .
Reserved XML characters in text data must be replaced with appropriate character entities . For example , in the company name &quot; Joe &apos;s Garage , &quot; the single quote character must be replaced by an entity . The actual row would look like :
Binary data is bin.hex encoded ( that is , one byte maps to two characters , one character per nibble ) .

# # # Managing projects with full control
&gt; After Project Server imports a project , the user chooses whether to delete the project from the site or break the connection before editing the project . You can make the choice in Project Professional .
Figure 2 shows the following processes when Project Server maintains enterprise projects with full control :

The following general comments apply to Figure 3 :
&gt; The SOAP-based ASMX interface for web services in the PSI is still available in Project Server 2013 , but is deprecated .
- Optimizes calls to the PSI from remote clients .
- Identifies PSI calls that invoke registered local event handlers .
- Identifies PSI calls that require the Project Calculation Service .
- Uses a server-based cache that works with the client-side Active Cache in Project Professional to reduce roundtrip calls to Project Server .
Business objects are not exposed to third-party developers . The PSI handles mapping of the API to business objects , and the CSOM maps its API to the PSI . The logical entities of business objects can be classified into three types :
- * * Core entities * * are objects such as projects , tasks , assignments , resources , and calendars . The core entities include basic business logic such as permissions and naming rules .
- * * Support entities * * are objects such as security and validation .
# # # Project Server database
&gt; Direct access is not supported for the draft ( `draft` prefix ) , published ( `pub` prefix ) , and archive ( `ver` prefix ) tables and views . Reports should use only the reporting tables and views , which have the `dbo` prefix .
Project Server data is partitioned in the Project database as follows :
- The archive data saves backup versions of projects , resources , custom fields , and other data .
# # # Publishing and server-side scheduling
1 . Project Server applies updates and reschedules the published version .
2 . Project Server saves the update to apply to the draft version when either of the following events occur :
- Project Professional opens the project .
- Project Professional tries to publish the project .
3 . If there is a conflict , the project manager is notified and must resolve the conflict before the draft version can be published .

This topic addresses issues of XLL compatibility in different versions of Microsoft Excel .
# # Useful constant definitions
# # Getting the running version
# # Creating add-ins that export dual interfaces
Consider an XLL function that takes a string and returns a value that can be any of the worksheet data types . You could export a function registered as type &quot; PD &quot; and prototyped as follows where the string is passed as a length-counted byte string .
Although this works perfectly well , there are several reasons why this is not the ideal interface to your code starting in Excel 2007 :

# Chapter 12 : Remote Data Service ( RDS ) tutorial
This tutorial is coded in different languages for two reasons :
This tutorial is based on the RDS programming model . It discusses each step of the programming model individually . In addition , it illustrates each step with a fragment of Visual Basic code .
# # # RDS programming model with objects
This tutorial does not use the * * RDS.DataControl * * , but this is how it would look if it did :
Nor does the tutorial invoke RDS with ADO objects , but this is how it would look if it did :
# # Step 4 : Server returns the Recordset
On the client side , a * * Recordset * * object is returned and assigned to a local variable .
In this tutorial , set the * * SourceRecordset * * property :
If the * * Recordset * * object is edited , any changes ( that is , rows that are added , changed , or deleted ) can be sent back to the server .
For example , the * * RDS.DataControl * * object could be created like this :
However , for this tutorial , use the imaginary server , &quot; yourServer . &quot;

# Excel Commands , Functions , and States
Microsoft Excel recognizes two very different types of added functionality : commands and functions .
In Excel , commands have the following characteristics :
- They can do anything a user can do ( subject to the limits of the interface used ) , such as altering Excel settings , opening , closing , and editing documents , initiating recalculations , and so on .
- They can be linked to control objects so that they are called when some action is taken on that object , such as left-clicking .
- They are never called by Excel during a recalculation .
Functions in Excel do the following :
- They can be called by commands .
- They cannot call commands .
The following is true of Excel worksheet functions :
- They cannot access macro sheet information functions .
- They can be written and registered as thread-safe starting in Excel 2007 .
The following is true of Excel macro-sheet functions :
- They can access macro sheet information functions .
- They are not considered thread safe starting in Excel 2007 .
- * * Point mode : * * The user is editing a formula and is selecting cells whose addresses are added to the formula being edited .
- The user opens a built-in dialog box .
- The user initiates a recalculation .
- The user runs a command .
- A timer event is trapped .

# # # Set up the Visual Studio project
Visual Studio creates the project and accesses the Project Online site .
# # # Enable sideloading on the Project Online site
Sideloading is the mechanism for testing and debugging Project Online add-ins . You need two scripts for sideloading : one to enable sideloading on your Project Online site and another to disable sideloading once you finish testing and debugging the add-in .
# # Add content to the add-in project
- Linking the JSOM library
- Adding UI Elements to the add-in
- Initializing and connecting to the Project Online service
- Retrieving projects and details / properties
- App.css - optional ; contains style definitions developed for the add-in
# # # Set application scope
The add-in needs scope or permission levels defined before the service returns information in query results . For this add-in , use the following scope to the Visual Studio project . This change is made to the AppManifest.xml file in the Permissions tab :
&#124; Scope &#124; Permission &#124;
# # # Link the JSOM library
# # # Add UI elements to the add-in
- Table that lists the project ID and name , and the task information .
- Tasks Button ( cloned once for each project ) that imports task data into the table .
# # # Initialize and connect to the host system
If the query succeeds , the add-in continues by calling displayProjects .
&gt; The while loop accesses the ID and name properties . This is slightly different than the source code project that calls a function that , in turn , accesses the same properties .

If the input does not start with any of these things , Excel checks against known patterns of input such as dates , times , currency amounts , percentages , or numbers , and interprets accordingly . This is done in a locale-specific way . If none of these interpretations makes sense , Excel reverts to considering the input as a string and places it in the cell unchanged .
All worksheet numbers in Excel are represented internally as 8-byte double-precision floating point , including all integers . However , the implementation of these numbers in Excel is not fully IEEE compliant , as shown in the following table .
IEEE subnormal numbers ( that is , numbers in the range 2.2250738585072009E-308 to 4.9406564584124654E-324 ) are not supported in Excel worksheets but are supported by VBA Doubles .
&gt; Byte strings are still fully supported in the C API for backward compatibility ; however they still have the same 255-character limit .

title : &quot; Accessing XLL code in Excel &quot;
# Accessing XLL code in Excel
To be accessible in Microsoft Excel , the functions and commands that an XLL contains :
- Must be exported by the XLL .
- Must be registered with Excel .
# # Registering functions and commands with Excel
Registration tells Excel the following about a DLL entry point :
- Whether it is hidden or , if a function , whether it is visible in the Function Wizard .
- Whether it is callable only from an XLM macro sheet , or also from a worksheet .
- What its XLL / DLL export name is , and what name you want Excel to use .
- If it is a function :
- Whether it is volatile .
- Whether it is thread safe ( supported starting in Excel 2007 ) .
- What text the Paste Function Wizard and AutoComplete editor should display to help with calling the function .
- The definition of a defined name .
# # Calling XLL commands directly from Excel
Once they are registered , XLL commands can be called in all the ways that other user-defined macros can be called :
- From the Run Macro dialog box .
- From a customized menu item or toolbar .
&gt; XLL commands are hidden in that they do not appear on the list of available macros in Excel dialog boxes . But they can be entered manually into the macro name field . Excel expects the registered-as name in these dialog boxes , not the DLL export name .
All XLL commands registered with Excel are assumed by Excel to be of the following form :
- &#91; Creating XLLs &#93; ( creating-xlls.md )
- &#91; Call XLL Functions from the Function Wizard or Replace Dialog Boxes &#93; ( how-to-call-xll-functions-from-the-function-wizard-or-replace-dialog-boxes.md )

title : &quot; Developing DLLs &quot;
The main benefits of DLLs are as follows :
- Applications &apos; executable files are kept smaller .
- They enable large development projects to be broken down . Application and DLL developers only need agree an interface between their respective parts . This interface is exported by the DLL .
- DLL developers can update DLLs — perhaps to make them more efficient or to fix a bug — without having to update all the applications that use it , provided that the exported interface of the DLL does not change .
You can use DLLs to add worksheet functions and commands in Microsoft Excel .
# # Resources for creating DLLs
To create a DLL , you need the following :
- A source code editor .
- A linker to add code from static libraries , where used , and to create the executable DLL file .
Modern integrated development environments ( IDEs ) , such as Microsoft Visual Studio , provide all of these things . They also provide a great deal more : smart editors , tools to debug your code , tools to manage multiple projects , new project wizards , and many other important tools .
The general syntax of a line that follows an * * EXPORTS * * statement is as follows .
&gt; All pointers are four bytes wide in Win32 . The return type has no impact on name decoration .
When you are placing C function prototypes in header files that could be included in C or C + + source files , you should include the following pre-processor directive .
For example , when you are using Microsoft Visual Studio , these lines can be incorporated into a common header file as follows .

# Integrating manageability applications with Office 365 click-to-run installer
Learn how to integrate the Office 365 Click-to-Run installer with a software management solution .
The Office 365 Click-to-Run installer provides a COM interface that allows IT Professionals and software management solutions programmatic control over update management . This interface provides additional management capabilities beyond what is provided by the Office Deployment Tool .
&gt; This article applies to Office 2016 and later , Office 365 .
# # Integrating with the Click-to-Run
To use this interface , a manageability application invokes the COM interface and calls exposed APIs that communicate directly with the Click-to-Run installation service .
* * Following is a conceptual diagram of the COM interface * *
A forth method , * * Status * * , can be used to get information about the status of the last executed command or the status of the currently executing command ( i.e. success , failure , detailed error codes ) .
* * Following is the COM Interface State Machine diagram * *
* * Idle : * * When the Click-to-Run installer is in the idle state , you can call :
- * * Apply * * : Install previously downloaded content .
- * * Cancel * * : Returns `0x800000e` , &quot; A method was called at an unexpected time . &quot;
- * * Download * * : Downloads new content to the client for later installation .

- Your C2R version is newer than the above build ( \ &gt; = June fork build ) .
The minimum requirement for a customized BITS interface to work with Office C2R service is :
- For the `Addfile` and `AddFileWithRanges` functions , the remote URL is in the following format :
- cmbits is hard coded , and stands for customized BITS .
- _ \ &lt; relative path to target file \ &gt; _ provides the location and file name of the file to download .
# # Automating content staging
* * The following image is an overview of downloading a custom image * *
# # # Overview of downloading a custom image
An enterprise configures their WSUS to sync the Office 365 Client Updates . These updates do not contain the actual image payload but does allow the manageability software to recognize when new content is available . The manageability software can then read the Client Update metadata to understand what version of Office the update applies to .
# # # Format of the XML file list
There are two parameters that need to be combined with the XML to make a custom image :
- Define * baseURL * by using the URL value associated with the branch the image is being created for . This is derived from the Client Update metadata , explained in the following section .
1 . Open the XML file list .
3 . Read the URL attribute for the target branch .
&gt; Nodes with language = &apos; 0&apos; are language neutral and must be included in the image .
# # # Hash verification of .dat files
To validate the integrity of the stream.x64.bg-bg.dat file , open the stream.x64.bg-bg.hash and read the HASH value which is the first line of text in the hash file . Compare this to the computed hash value ( using the specified hashing algorithm ) to verify the integrity of the downloaded .dat file .
The following example shows the C # code to read the hash .
# # # Office 365 Client Updates
Each Office 365 Client Update that is published includes metadata about the update . This metadata includes a parameter called * MoreInfoUrl * which can be used to derive the following information :
- * Ver * : Identifies the Office version associated with this update .
- * Branch * : Identifies the Update Channel for this update . Values include InsiderFast , Insiders , Monthly , Targeted , Broad . Additional values may be added in the future .
- * Arch * : Identifies the processor architecture associated with this update .
- * xmlVer * : The version of the XML file lists that should be used to construct the base image for this update .
- * xmlPath * : Path to the OFL.CAB file which contains the XML file lists .
# # # Additional metadata for automating content staging
- The * Default * attribute , if set to True , identifies the recommended SKU .
- The * Name * attribute is the displayed application name .
&gt; This attribute has been deprecated and is used for backward compatibility only . Use the ID attribute in place of the Name attribute .
# Recordset2.Edit method ( DAO )
* expression * .Edit
The current record remains current after you use * * Edit * * .
Using * * Edit * * produces an error if :
- There is no current record .
- Another user has locked the page containing your record ( Microsoft Access workspace ) .

The minimum value of this weight is 0x1 and the maximum value is LONG _ MAX . Any other values for the weight are considered invalid .
When Outlook 2007 sends a mail to or resolves a recipient , it will increase that recipient &apos;s weight by 0x2000 .

# About the Security Model for Form Templates with Code
&gt; The security level &quot; 1 &quot; is not used by the current InfoPath COM server and is reserved for future use .
&gt; Even though object model levels 0 and 2 do not demand any permission set , because they contain managed code , they behave as defined for the Domain domain access security level that is described in the following section .
# # InfoPath Domain Access Security Levels
4 . Select the desired security level .
# # Common Language Runtime Code Access Security Features
- Within the CLR hosted by InfoPath , each managed code form template runs in a separate application domain , which is an environment that provides isolation , unloading , and security boundaries for executing managed code .
- By default , a managed code form template running on the local computer ( the My Computer Zone code group ) gets a lower level of permissions than Full Trust ( Local Intranet Zone permissions ) . To have Full Trust permissions , the form must be registered or digitally signed with a trusted certificate .
&gt; - The InfoPath Form Templates code group applies only to the managed code form code assembly itself . As a result , if you grant the Full Trust permission set to InfoPath managed code form code , but you have not installed and registered ( or digitally signed ) the form template itself ( which makes the entire form template fully trusted ) , calls in the form code to security level 3 object model members will still fail .
For information on how to create and configure the InfoPath Form Templates code group , see &#91; Configure Security Settings for Form Templates with Code &#93; ( how-to-configure-security-settings-for-form-templates-with-code.md ) .
&#124; The form template is downloaded or copied from an Internet location . &lt; br / &gt; &#124; By default , none . The managed code assembly for the form template is not loaded and does not run . &lt; br / &gt; &#124; &#124;

title : &quot; Access DLLs in Excel &quot;
You can access a DLL function or command in Microsoft Excel in several ways :
- Directly from the worksheet or from a customized item in the user interface ( UI ) .
# # Calling DLL functions and commands from VBA
&gt; VBA cannot check that the argument list and return stated in the Visual Basic module are the same as coded in the DLL . You should check this yourself very carefully , because a mistake could cause Excel to crash .
# # # Variant and string arguments
# # Calling DLL functions directly from the worksheet
You cannot access Win32 DLL functions from the worksheet without , for example , using VBA or XLM as interfaces , or without letting Excel know about the function , its arguments , and its return type in advance . The process of doing this is called registration .
- Declare the function in VBA as described previously and access it via a VBA user-defined function .
- Call the DLL function using CALL on an XLM macro sheet , and access it via an XLM user-defined function .
# # Calling DLL commands directly from Excel
Win32 DLL commands are not accessible directly from Excel dialog boxes and menus without there being an interface , such as VBA , or without the commands being registered in advance .
- Declare the command in VBA as described previously and access it via a VBA macro .
All XLL commands that are registered with Excel are assumed by Excel to be of the following form .

title : Absolute and relative URLs
A URL specifies the location of a target stored on a local or networked computer , such as a file , directory , HTML page , image , program , and so on . In this discussion , an * absolute URL * is of the form :
An * absolute URL * contains all the information necessary to locate a resource .
One function of an open connection , represented by a &#91; Connection &#93; ( connection-object-ado.md ) object , is to restrict subsequent operations to the data source represented by that connection . That is , the connection defines the context for subsequent operations .
# # Relative URLs as command text
The relative URL in the command text uses the absolute URL as a starting point and specifies the remainder of the path ( system32 ) and the file to open ( Readme25.txt ) .
The options field indicates that the command type is a relative URL .
As another example , the following code will open a * * Recordset * * on the contents of the directory :
# # OLE DB provider-supplied URL schemes

# # Differences Between VBScript and Visual Basic
Using ADO with VBScript is similar to using ADO with Visual Basic in many ways , including how syntax is used . However , some significant differences exist :
- VBScript supports only the Variant data type , which can hold different types of data . You can store the data you need in a Variant data type , and the data will function appropriately due to casting performed by VBScript . It recognizes the type required by ADO , and converts the value in the Variant accordingly .
Locks or unlocks a message . This method is called only by the MAPI spooler .

# # # Using the PSI
# # # Using the CSOM
&gt; Because PDS applications must be completely redesigned for Project Server 2013 , we recommend that you use the CSOM .
- Use the CSOM for applications that are adapted for use with Project Online .
- Applications that rely on or modify specific Project Server security settings .
# # # Migration and compatibility of custom solutions
&gt; We strongly recommend that you thoroughly test solutions on a non-production installation of Project Server 2013 before deploying them to a production server .
When you migrate a solution to Project Server 2013 , or if a solution does not work as expected , you should at a minimum do the following :
- Change the target to .NET Framework 4 .
- Make a list of the ASMX web references or the WCF service references and namespace names , and then delete the Project Server references .
- Compile and test the solution .
# # Project scheduling on the server
&gt; To use the updated scheduling engine in Project Server 2013 , applications can use the CSOM .
Project Server deletes actuals on a summary task assignment if the subtask duration shortens or the finish date is changed .
&gt; Although Project Professional can do it , we recommend that you do not make assignments on summary tasks .
Following are issues and limitations of PSI programming with the older Project Server scheduling engine :
- If the CSOM has the methods the application requires , use the CSOM instead of the PSI .
- Open projects in Project Professional and save them back to Project Server .
- In reports , do not include fields that the PSI does not update .

title : &quot; Handle high DPI and DPI scaling in your Office solution &quot;
# Handle high DPI and DPI scaling in your Office solution
# # DPI scaling symptoms in your solution
Windows applies DPI scaling when an application is moved from one display to another display with a different DPI . This happens in scenarios such as dragging an application to a different monitor or docking your laptop . If your Office solution is adversely affected by DPI scaling , you will see one or more of the following symptoms :
The following types of Office solutions can be affected by DPI scaling :
- Office web add-ins
&#124; Mode &#124; Description &#124; When DPI changes &#124;
&#124; Per Monitor DPI aware &#124; Application is capable of redrawing itself correctly when the DPI changes . &#124; Windows will send DPI notifications to top-level windows in the application so that it can redraw when the DPI changes . &#124;
&#124; Per Monitor v2 &#124; Application is capable of redrawing itself correctly when the DPI changes . &#124; Windows will send DPI notifications to both top-level and child windows so that the application can redraw when the DPI changes . &#124;
# # How Office supports DPI scaling
- The COM / VSTO top-level window is Per Monitor DPI aware .
- The ActiveX control child window is System DPI aware .
- The Office top-level window is Per Monitor DPI aware .
- The custom task pane child window is System DPI aware .
# # Managing thread DPI context
When the host Office app starts , its main thread runs in Per Monitor DPI aware context . When your solution code creates threads , or receives calls from Office , you need to manage the thread DPI context .
&gt; Your context block should restore the original DPI thread context before calling other components outside of your solution code .
# # # # Managed code context block
# # # # Native code context block
# # Child window management
You will see two different DPI modes applied to your child window , depending on which version of Windows 10 Office is running on .
Office has a setting to optimize for compatibility when moving to different DPI scales on different screens . The compatibility mode disables DPI scaling so that everything in Office is bitmap stretched when moved to a display using different DPI scaling .

How to support DPI scaling in ActiveX controls depends on whether the control is windowed or windowless .
# # # # Windowed ActiveX controls
# # # # Windowless ActiveX controls
Office Add-ins built using the Office JavaScript API run inside a browser control . You can handle DPI scaling using the same techniques used in any web app design . Many online resources are available to help design a web page for high resolution screens .
# # Verify that your solution supports DPI scaling

# Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC
The provider supports transactions , although different DBMS engines offer different types of transaction support . For example , Microsoft Access supports nested transactions up to five levels deep .
This is the default provider for ADO , and all provider-dependent ADO properties and methods are supported .
The provider does not support any specific connection parameters in addition to those defined by ADO . However , the provider will pass any non-ADO connection parameters to the ODBC driver manager .

# Security levels , email deployment , and remote form templates
- HTML Task Panes
- XML File Query
- Web Service Query
The Full Trust security level can only be set for installed or signed form templates ; otherwise , the maximum trust level is Domain . InfoPath will not set a security level to Full Trust automatically .
&#124; Highest Level of Trust Granted &#124; Full Trust &#124; Client Computer ( Sandboxed ) &#124; Intranet ( Sandboxed ) &#124; Internet ( Sandboxed ) &#124; Restricted &#124;
# # Form open behavior
# # Specifying a security level
The InfoPath form designer automatically selects the appropriate security level ( either Restricted or Domain ) based on the features that you are using in the form . The security setting is always as restrictive as possible , starting at Restricted , to help ensure a greater level of protection for you and your data . Users can manually override this automated setting to select a level of security that is more appropriate for the form by following these steps :
# # Mail deployment and browser-enabled form templates
# # Understanding form identity
All forms in the InfoPath designer are created with an identity . This identity information helps InfoPath associate forms with form templates in the cache and to retrieve updates to forms when they are posted to a shared location . By default , InfoPath creates two identities for form templates : a Form ID and an Access Path .
1 . Look for a fully trusted form template with a matching Form ID .
3 . Look for a form template in the cache with a matching Form ID .
# # Designing a form to send as an attachment to an email message
# # Email deployment : restricted , domain , and Full Trust form templates
# # Sharing forms by email message or from a common shared location
# # Benefits of using signed form templates
- It allows the form template to open with Full Trust security .
Additionally , if a form template is signed , you get the added benefit of the automatic update functionality . For more information , see &#91; Deploying Signed InfoPath Form Templates &#93; ( deploying-signed-infopath-form-templates.md ) .
# # # Example : Updating domain or restricted templates
1 . &quot; A &quot; sends a signed form template to &quot; B &quot; .
2 . &quot; B &quot; opens the form template .
3 . &quot; A &quot; updates the form template ( for example , adds more fields ) .
4 . &quot; A &quot; sends the updated form template to &quot; B &quot; .
5 . &quot; B &quot; opens the updated form template .
# # # Example : Deploying restricted form templates on an extranet
2 . Change the form template security level to Restricted .
3 . Save the form template on your computer desktop .
4 . Remove the URL ( required only if users have access to the original publish location ) .
5 . Send the form to users on an extranet .
6 . Have the users install the form .
# # Signature verification failure
# # Infrastructure registry keys for form migration open behavior
The Name values correspond to the Internet Explorer domain settings . These values determine the form open behavior in these security zones , either blocking or allowing the opening of the form , or giving the user the option to open the form .
For example , when a form matches a form template based on Form ID but not on Access Path , and the form template is cached from an Internet location , InfoPath will show an error dialog with a Help button .

&gt; Project Online does not support OLAP cubes .
&gt; You can use the CSOM in SharePoint Server 2013 . Project sites are SharePoint sites .
The CSOM does not enable extensions such as the PSI can have . For example , if you create a PSI extension for local use , the CSOM cannot be modified to use the PSI extension . You can implement extension scenarios in other ways :
- Aggregate CSOM calls within a local component or a component that runs on Microsoft Azure .
- Use OData queries of the reporting data , instead of directly accessing reporting tables in the Project Server database .
- Integrate CSOM calls with third-party applications through OAuth authentication from Project Online or with server-side components for on-premises use .
- Applications that use the CSOM can also use custom databases either on-premises or with SQL Azure .

title : &quot; Cluster safe functions &quot;
The mechanics of declaring UDFs as cluster-safe resemble those of declaring UDFs as safe for multi-threaded recalculation . However , because the UDF is not necessarily running on the same computer as other UDFs from the same Excel session , there are different considerations when writing cluster-safe UDFs .
- A UDF should not rely on any memory state . For example , a UDF should not rely on an existing in-memory cache .
- A UDF should not perform Excel callbacks that the cluster connector provider does not support .
In addition to cluster-safe behavior , there are the following technical restrictions on cluster-safe UDFs :
&gt; You cannot declare a cluster-safe UDF as an asynchronous UDF .
A UDF can determine whether it is being run using a cluster connector by calling the &#91; xlRunningOnCluster &#93; ( xlrunningoncluster.md ) callback function .

Data providers represent diverse sources of data such as SQL databases , indexed-sequential files , spreadsheets , document stores , and mail files . Providers expose data uniformly using a common abstraction called the rowset .
ADO is powerful and flexible because it can connect to any of several different data providers and still expose the same programming model , regardless of the specific features of any given provider . However , because each data provider is unique , how your application interacts with ADO will vary by data provider .

title : &apos; Chapter 7 : Handling ADO events&apos;
The group of events that occur after an operation completes are especially important if you use ADO asynchronously . For example , an application that starts an asynchronous &#91; Recordset.Open &#93; ( open-method-ado-recordset.md ) operation is notified by an execution complete event when the operation concludes .
Using the ADO event model adds some overhead to your application but provides far more flexibility than other methods of dealing with asynchronous operations , such as monitoring the &#91; State &#93; ( state-property-ado.md ) property of an object with a loop .

# Deploying Signed InfoPath Form Templates
# # Digitally Signing a Form Template
# # # To digitally sign a form template
# # Establishing a Trusted Root Certificate and Publisher
&gt; If a signed form template requests Domain or Restricted access , InfoPath will use the signature to verify that the form template was not tampered with after it was signed . InfoPath also uses the signature to determine whether the form template can be updated automatically .
# # Deploying Signed Form Templates with Full Trust Access
However , depending on your organization &apos;s computing environment , you might prefer to use either signed form templates or fully trusted forms . For example , there are benefits to using a signed form template that requests full-trust access instead of a registered , fully trusted form . A signed form template requesting full-trust access has the following benefits :
A signed form template that has a Domain or Restricted security level also has the advantage of the automatic update functionality . For example , you could publish a signed form template to a document library on a server that is running Microsoft SharePoint Foundation or on a server that has a Domain security level . When you update your form template in the shared location , users will get the updated copy automatically .

# Memory Management in Excel
There are memory considerations for the following three data structure types :
- By Excel when preparing arguments to be passed to an XLL function
- By your DLL when creating arguments to be passed to a C API call
- By your DLL when creating an XLL function return value
- It can be dynamically allocated by Excel .

- The C-language declarations assume that your compiler uses 8-byte doubles , 2-byte short integers , and 4-byte long integers by default .
# # Additional data type information
# # # K and K % data types
# # # O and O % data types
# # # P and Q data types
# # # Volatile functions and recalculation
# # # Functions declared as void
There are two cases that call for declaring a function as returning void . In both cases , the function returns its result by other means .
# # # # Modifying in place
# # # # Asynchronous functions
# # # Registering worksheet functions as macro sheet equivalents ( handling uncalculated cells )
# # # Registering worksheet functions as thread-safe
# # # Registering worksheet functions as cluster-safe
If you have registered a function as cluster-safe , you must ensure that it behaves in a cluster-safe way . For more information , see &#91; Cluster Safe Functions &#93; ( cluster-safe-functions.md ) .

title : &quot; About Operators &quot;
You can use operators in formulas to perform arithmetic operations ( addition , subtraction , multiplication , and so on ) or logical comparisons ( greater than , less than , equal to , and so on ) . You also can control the order of evaluation in a formula by enclosing expressions in parentheses . Use the ampersand operator to combine ( concatenate ) character strings .
When you use comparison operators to compare text strings , the strings are first converted into numeric values . Text strings that cannot be converted return a value of 0 ; therefore , comparisons vary and might not produce the results you expect . To do a standard string comparison , use the function STRSAME or STRSAMEEX .
# # Order of evaluation
&#124; &#124; Division &lt; br / &gt; &#124; / &lt; br / &gt; &#124;
&#124; &#124; Subtraction &lt; br / &gt; &#124; - &lt; br / &gt; &#124;
The ampersand operator returns a new character string . You can create compound words and phrases using the ampersand operator . Use the following syntax :
&gt; &#91; in &#93; A string that names the message class of the form to be removed from the form container . Message class names are always ANSI strings , never Unicode .

# # 1.7 IMPLEMENTATION RESTRICTIONS ON COMMAND ARGUMENTS
The below restrictions are placed on command arguments in its current implementation in Office 2013 .
# # # Length limitations on URI command arguments
For URI command arguments , the maximum path length is 256 characters for all apps except Excel , where the limit is 216 . Path lengths greater than these may be supported on an app-by-app basis and testing is recommended before deploying any solutions that rely on this .
# # # Allowed characters in URI command arguments
&gt; document-uri = URI location of document to open
&gt; template-uri = URI location of template file upon which new file will be based
&gt; save-location = URI location of folder in which new document should be created
Note that the vertical bar used as a delimiter in this specification is not among those characters identified in section 2.2 of RFC 3986 as reserved for potential use as delimiters .. This is done intentionally to maximize the set of characters the URI command argument can support without a need to percent-encode those characters .

- The presence of additional sign-in UI that must be handled .
Additionally , Office uses many components ( such as Simple MAPI , WinInet , and MSDAIPP ) that can cache client authentication information to speed processing . When Office is being automated server-side and processing multiple files , if authentication information has been cached for that session , one client can use the cached credentials of another client . Therefore , the client can gain non-granted access permissions by impersonating other users .
# # # Resiliency and stability
Microsoft strongly recommends a few alternatives that do not require Office to be installed and run server-side , and that can perform common tasks more efficiently and more quickly than automation in this configuration . Before you involve Office as a server-side component in your project , consider alternatives .

# Content controls in Word
Learn how Microsoft Word 2013 content controls enable a larger range of structured document scenarios .
Here are some common scenarios for structured content in Microsoft Word :
# # # Using content controls to structure a document
Content controls are ideal for creating structured documents because content controls help you fix the position of content , specify the kind of content ( for example , a date , a picture , or text ) , restrict or enable editing , and add semantic meaning to content .
The following content controls are available in Word 2010 :
Word 2010 content controls enable various potential structured document solutions , but in Word 2013 content controls enable a greater range of scenarios .
# # Content control improvements in Word 2013
In Word 2013 , content controls provide three key improvements : improved visualization , support for XML Mapping for Rich Text content controls , and a new content control for repeating content .
- Start / End tags
- On mouse-over , the content control appears as a shaded rectangle
# # # Start / End tags
When the content control is set to show as * * None * * , the content control is not displayed .
# # # Content control colorization
# # # Supporting repeating content
# # # Repeating section content controls around XML-mapped controls
For XML mappings that are contained in a repeating section , Word 2013 maps them as follows .
- The remainder of the XPath is evaluated relative to the XPath of the repeating section content item
For example , the following mappings might occur :
The binding is therefore evaluated as . \ baz , where the base is the node of the repeating content item .
# # # Working with repeating section content controls that are mapped to XML data
If you want to bind a repeating section content control to a table , insert the table and * then * the insert repeating section content control , and not the other way around . ( Otherwise , you won &apos;t be able to select only the table ) .
# # # Nesting repeating section content controls within a table
# # # Open XML File Format schema additions
The following elements were added to the WordprocessingML Open XML File Format schema .
# # New Word 2013 content control object model members
The following table lists constants in the new * * WdContentControlAppearance * * enumeration .

# Working with multidimensional data
For example , if the Geography and Product dimensions from a cube containing sales data are oriented along the x-axis of a cellset , a position along this axis may contain the members &quot; USA &quot; and &quot; Computers . &quot; In this example , determining a position along the x-axis requires that members from each dimension are oriented along the axis .
For example , a cube has the following six dimensions ( note that this cube schema differs slightly from the example given in &#91; Overview of Multidimensional Schemas and Data &#93; ( overview-of-multidimensional-schemas-and-data.md ) ) :
&gt; The cell values in the example can be viewed as ordered pairs of axis position ordinals where the first digit represents the x-axis position and the second digit the y-axis position .
- Axis dimensions : Quarters , Salesperson , Geography
- Filter dimensions : Measures , Years , Products
- Two axes : COLUMN ( x , or Axis 0 ) and ROW ( y , or Axis 1 )
- x-axis : two nested dimensions , Salesperson and Geography
- y-axis : Quarters dimension
Each coordinate is represented as a position with two members — one from the Salesperson dimension and another from the Geography dimension :
The y-axis has only one dimension , containing the following eight positions :

The equivalent in Visual C + + to the first two forms above is :
In all the methods , indicate that the number of records affected should not be returned by setting * RecordsAffected * to the null pointer . In this case , the null pointer is not so much a missing parameter as an indication that the method should discard the number of records affected .
Thus , for these three methods , it is valid to code something such as :

title : &quot; Selecting an API or technology for developing solutions for Outlook &quot;
# Selecting an API or technology for developing solutions for Outlook
Microsoft supports various APIs and technologies that extend Outlook :
- The auxiliary APIs complement MAPI in a few scenarios .
- Why would you consider Office Add-ins , and when would you choose to create apps as opposed to add-ins ?
- If your solution has to run on earlier versions of Outlook , including Outlook 2003 , how does that affect your API choice ?
- If your solution has to iterate through Outlook folders that contain thousands of items , and you need to be able to modify those items , which API would work best ?
- If your solution relies heavily on Outlook business logic and interacts with other Office applications , is the Outlook object model the best choice ?
- What do the object model and MAPI allow you to extend in Outlook ?
- If you can use either the object model or MAPI to achieve your task , how should you decide which API to use ?
# # Objective evaluation criteria
- Security criteria — Describes the security and permissions issues related to the technology .
- Deployment criteria — Describes the recommended deployment and distribution methods for the technology .
# # # Objective evaluation criteria for the apps for Office platform
# # # # Functional criteria
&#124; Threading models &lt; br / &gt; &#124; Each mail app executes in its own process separate from the Outlook process . &lt; br / &gt; &#124;
# # # # Development criteria
&#124; Managed implementation &lt; br / &gt; &#124; Where appropriate in your scenario , you can use managed .aspx pages to implement server-side code for your mail apps . &lt; br / &gt; &#124;
&#124; Expert availability &lt; br / &gt; &#124; Programmers who have the required level of web development expertise for Office Add-ins are relatively easy to find . The platform is intended for both professional and non-professional developers . &lt; br / &gt; &#124;
# # # # Security criteria
&#124; Design-time permissions &lt; br / &gt; &#124; No special permissions are required to develop mail apps . &lt; br / &gt; &#124;
# # # # Deployment criteria
The following tables show evaluation criteria for the Outlook object model and PIA .
&#124; Scriptable &lt; br / &gt; &#124; The Outlook object model can be used in scripts . &lt; br / &gt; &#124;
# # # Objective evaluation criteria for MAPI
The following tables show evaluation criteria for MAPI .
&#124; Data-access model &lt; br / &gt; &#124; MAPI represents messages and users as a hierarchical set of objects . &lt; br / &gt; &#124;
&#124; Transactions &lt; br / &gt; &#124; MAPI does not support transactions . &lt; br / &gt; &#124;
&#124; Scriptable &lt; br / &gt; &#124; MAPI cannot be directly used in scripts . &lt; br / &gt; &#124;
&#124; Developer and deployment licensing &lt; br / &gt; &#124; No special licensing is required for developing applications that use MAPI . &lt; br / &gt; &#124;
&#124; Setup permissions &lt; br / &gt; &#124; Setting up MAPI-based applications typically requires the user to be a local administrator , or to have rights to install software . &lt; br / &gt; &#124;
&#124; Built-in security features &lt; br / &gt; &#124; MAPI profiles can be password protected on most platforms . &lt; br / &gt; &#124;
&#124; Deployment methods &lt; br / &gt; &#124; Applications that use MAPI can be deployed to client computers by using standard software distribution technologies . &lt; br / &gt; &#124;
&#124; Deployment notes &lt; br / &gt; &#124; The installer should verify that the correct version of MAPI is available . &lt; br / &gt; &#124;
- You can enjoy rapid turnaround of building and releasing apps via the Office Store .
- You can activate a mail app if the selected message contains some known entities , such as an address , contact , email address , meeting suggestion , or task suggestion .
- You can take advantage of authentication by identity tokens , and of Exchange Web Services .
- You can modify and add custom commands in the ribbon and Backstage view .
In general , use the object model or the PIA if your solution customizes the Outlook user interface or relies on Outlook &apos;s business logic . Following are the major baseline scenarios for which Outlook solutions use the object model or the PIA .
# # Decision factors for MAPI
In general , you use MAPI to access data on a MAPI-based server such as the Microsoft Exchange server , and to do tasks such as the following :
- Create a sink process .
- Create or manipulate a profile .
- Run an application as a Windows NT service .
In addition , if your solution runs on a version of Outlook earlier than Outlook 2007 , and scenarios such as the following apply to your solution , you should use MAPI to extend those scenarios .
- Manage accounts , attachments , Exchange distribution lists , Exchange users , or stores .
- Store private data for solutions .
- Manage a message store for an account .
# # Decision factors for the Auxiliary APIs
The Outlook auxiliary APIs can integrate with Outlook business logic or MAPI in some scenarios where the object model or MAPI does not provide a solution . Use the Outlook auxiliary APIs in the following scenarios :
- Account management : Manage account information , manipulate accounts , provide notification on account changes , and protect accounts from spam .
- Rebasing calendars and time zone support : Rebase Outlook calendars to support daylight saving time .

# # Automating Outlook by in-process vs. out-of-process Solutions
&gt; The discussion of automating Outlook in this section and the next is outside the scope of Office Add-ins , which are intended to extend the functionality of the Office client or web application but not to automate it .
# # Automating Outlook by managed vs. unmanaged solutions
# # # Weather Bar extensibility
By default , Outlook uses weather data provided by MSN Weather . The Weather Bar supports third-party weather data web services which follow a defined protocol to communicate with Outlook . As long as a third-party weather data service supports this protocol , users can choose that weather data service to provide weather data in the Weather Bar .
- The versions of Outlook you intend your solution to support .
If your scenarios include showing social network information or updates in Outlook , you should use the OSC provider extensibility to create a COM-visible DLL . You can do this in either a managed or unmanaged language .

# Multithreaded recalculation in Excel
* * Figure 1 . Calculating concurrently on different threads * *
After A1 is calculated , A2 and then A3 can be calculated on one thread , while B1 and then C1 can be calculated on another , assuming all the cells are thread safe .
- VBA user-defined functions
- Built-in thread-unsafe worksheet functions ( see the next section for a list )
- COM add-in commands and functions
Excel only considers the following as thread safe :
- All unary and binary operators in Excel .
- Almost all built-in worksheet functions starting in Excel 2007 ( see exceptions list )
- XLL add-in functions that have been explicitly registered as thread-safe .
To be explicit , the following are considered to be unsafe :
- COM add-in user-defined functions
- XLM macro-sheet user-defined functions
- XLL add-in functions not explicitly registered as thread safe
- Calls to the &#91; xlfEvaluate &#93; ( xlfevaluate.md ) function for expressions that contain thread-unsafe functions or that contain defined names whose definitions contain thread-unsafe functions .
- Calls to the &#91; xlAbort &#93; ( xlabort.md ) function to clear a break condition .
- Calls to the &#91; xlCoerce &#93; ( xlcoerce.md ) function to get the value of an uncalculated cell reference .
The C API-only call-back functions are all thread safe :
The one exception is the * * xlSet * * function , which is , in any case , a command-equivalent and so cannot be called from any worksheet function .
# # Registering XLL functions as thread safe
- Do not call resources in other DLLs that may not be thread safe .
- Do not make any thread-unsafe calls via the C API or COM .
Excel imposes an additional restriction : thread-safe functions cannot be registered as macro-sheet equivalents , and therefore cannot call XLM information functions or get the values of un-recalculated cells .
- How to create and access memory that is associated with , and so private to , the executing thread .
Excel Services supports the loading , calculating , and rendering of Excel spreadsheets on a server . Users can then access and interact with the spreadsheets by using standard browser tools .

# About InfoPath Support for XML Technologies
# # Limitations of Traditional Forms and Documents for Gathering Data
On the other hand , traditional documents created by using a word processor enable the user to freely add and remove content , but provide little guidance about how to enter complete , structured , and valid information ; any fields that are defined in the document have minimal or no validation of data values and data types . Data in the fields is not properly labeled to enable easy referencing and automatic reuse . The data is free-form rather than structured ; you cannot group information , such as applying an &quot; Address &quot; label to a group of &quot; Street &quot; , &quot; City &quot; , and &quot; State &quot; fields .
# # Providing Easy-to-Use Views of XML Data by Using XSLT Transformations
InfoPath is built from the ground up on XML standards that includes the following :
- Extensible Markup Language ( XML ) 1.0 Second Edition
- Namespaces in XML
- Extensible Hypertext Markup Language ( XHTML ) 1.0
- Universal Description , Discovery , and Integration ( UDDI ) 1.0
8 . The changed part of the view is refreshed , by applying only the required parts of the XSLT style sheet to the DOM tree .
You can also design a form by using an existing XML Web service to provide the XML schema . To do this :
1 . Use UDDI to locate relevant Web services .
3 . Open the XML schema to load it .
4 . Lay out the UI controls and associate them with XML schema elements and attributes .
3 . Lay out the UI controls as described earlier in this section .

- Verify whether a supported version of Outlook is present .
- Verify whether the OSC is installed .
* * Figure 1 . Provider installation logic * *
- If Outlook is not installed , proceed to step 2 .
- If Outlook 2003 or Outlook 2007 is installed , proceed to step 3 .
- If Outlook 2010 or Outlook 2013 is installed , proceed to step 4 .
1 . Verify whether the OSC is installed by writing an installer custom action to test for the existence of the following qualified component ID :
The `Bitness` key is &quot; x86 &quot; for 32-bit Outlook , or &quot; x64 &quot; for 64-bit Outlook .
4 . Proceed with step 6 to find the current Outlook user interface locale to prepare for installing an appropriate version of the OSC .
Chain a g-link into your installation package to ensure that the latest version of the OSC is installed on the client computer . The g-link format is as follows :

You can create an OSC provider by using managed languages such as Visual C # or Visual Basic , or unmanaged languages such as Visual C + + . You can use any tool that can create a COM-visible DLL component to develop an OSC provider . The decision to use a managed or unmanaged language to develop a provider should take into account the download size and dependencies of the provider installation package .
An OSC provider must be COM-visible as defined by the following :
- After installation , an OSC provider must be registered by using COM self-registration or regsvr32 .
- COM registration of an OSC provider DLL registers the provider under HKCU or HKLM .
- An OSC provider developed in a managed language is COM-visible .
The component that supports OSC provider extensibility is the OSC provider extensibility DLL . Third-party developers can build OSC provider DLLs by using these extensibility interfaces . The following list shows the details of the OSC provider extensibility DLL :
- Extensibility DLL file name : socialprovider.dll
- Extensibility DLL major version : 15.0
JavaScript Object Notation ( JSON ) is not supported in the OSC provider extensibility model .

title : &quot; Working with XML Schemas in InfoPath &quot;
# Working with XML Schemas in InfoPath
&gt; The information contained in this topic applies to form templates designed for use in the InfoPath editor . Browser-compatible form templates have stricter XSD Schema requirements . For more information , see the documentation about XML Schemas in browser-compatible form templates available on MSDN .
To load an XSD schema file that was authored outside of InfoPath , follow these steps .
# # # To create a form template based on an external schema
The following sections describe XSD constructs that InfoPath cannot handle at run time . Avoid these constructs when creating a form template in the InfoPath form designer .
# # ENTITY and ENTITIES Types
InfoPath design mode supports designing a form template against schemas that use abstract complex types . For example , if an element named `shippingAddress` has an abstract complex type named `address` that has two derivations , `USAddress` and `CanadianAddress` , InfoPath treats any instance of `shippingAddress` as a choice between `shippingAddress` with type `USAddress` and `shippingAddress` with type `CanadianAddress` . In this example , if the provided schemas contain no types that derive from address , then InfoPath requests an additional schema that fulfills this requirement .
# # XSD Constructs with Reduced Functionality
The following sections describe XSD constructs that have reduced functionality when used to create a form template in the InfoPath form designer .
# # Unbounded Choice Elements
# # Choice of Model Groups
The following schema fragment shows an optional sibling with same qualified name ( `QName` ) :
# # Storing XML Signatures in the Data Source
# # The XSD Namespace Declaration
# # Importing and Including Schemas
To illustrate why this XSD segment is nondeterministic , assume you have the following XML fragment that you want to validate with this schema :
1 . If the XML fragment is validated against the first part of the choice declaration , then the XML is valid against the schema .
Some XSD validation systems err toward validating against this schema because there is a valid path . MSXML is stricter and raises an error stating that the schema is nondeterministic .
To understand why this schema segment is nondeterministic , assume you have the following invalid XML fragment :
Now assume that you have the following XML instance to validate :
# # Illegal Enumeration Values
# # Empty Sequence or Choice Elements
And that , your XML instance document resembles the following example .
Local definitions do not require the target namespace because qualification is turned off by default . However , if you change your local definition to be global , then your reference must be qualified with the namespace prefix . For example , the following schema is invalid .
If your schema has the * * targetNamespace * * attribute specified , ensure that all global references are qualified with the correct namespace prefix .
However , this example is not valid .
The two examples in the following sections show how to edit or author a schema to produce specific results in InfoPath .

title : &quot; Prerequisites for WCF-based code samples in Project &quot;
# Prerequisites for WCF-based code samples in Project
Before running the code samples , you must set up the development environment , configure the application , add a service configuration file ( or configure the WCF services programmatically ) , and change generic constant values to match your environment .
Use a test Project Server system whenever you are developing or testing . Even when your code works perfectly , interproject dependencies , reporting , or other environmental factors can cause unintended consequences .
# # Creating the application and adding a service reference
Also add a reference to * * System.Runtime.Serialization * * .
There are three ways to add a WCF service reference :
Advantages to using the WCF-based proxy assembly include the following :
- You can develop most solutions with the proxy assembly on a different computer than the Project Server computer . Setting an individual service reference requires development on the Project Server computer .
- The proxy assembly includes all PSI service namespaces , so you do not have to add multiple proxy files .
# # # Adding a service reference
If you know the full name of the Project Server Service application , you can use it to get the GUID value , for example :
# # Setting other references
Local references for the code sample are listed in * * using * * statements at the top of the sample .
# # Adding a service configuration file
&gt; If you run an application and get an error that the server is too busy , or that the HTTP request is unauthorized , ensure that the endpoint addresses are correct in the app.config file .
# # Changing values of generic constants
# # Verifying the results
Following are some of the links on the Server Settings page to use for typical cleanup activities after running code samples :
- * * Enterprise Custom Fields and Lookup Tables * *

title : Types of Cursors ( Access desktop database reference )
As a general rule , your application should use the simplest cursor that provides the required data access . Each additional cursor characteristic beyond the basics ( forward-only , read-only , static , scrolling , unbuffered ) has a price — in client memory , network load , or performance . In many cases , the default cursor options generate a more complex cursor than your application actually needs .
- If you have a large result set and need to select just a few rows , use a &#91; keyset &#93; ( keyset-cursors.md ) cursor .
- If you want to synchronize a result set with recent adds , changes , and deletes by all concurrent users , use a &#91; dynamic &#93; ( dynamic-cursors.md ) cursor .

# Troubleshooting Office files and custom solutions with the telemetry log
Use the Telemetry Log for Office 2013 to determine compatibility issues with Office 2013 and solutions built for previous versions of Office .
The following article describes the Telemetry Log and how to use it . For more information about specific results displayed in the Telemetry Log , see &#91; Compatibility issues in Office &#93; ( compatibility-issues-in-office.md ) .
# # How the Telemetry Log works
When you install Office 2013 , the Telemetry Log is installed , the local data store is created on the same computer , and the run-time logging APIs are enabled in the Office 2013 applications previously listed . However , a solution or file must be loaded or opened in the application before the Telemetry Log can start to monitor it .
# # # To use the Telemetry Log
1 . To open the Telemetry Log , do one of the following :
&gt; - Full computer name .
&gt; - Architecture of the operating system ( x64 / 64-bit or x86 / 32-bit ) .
&gt; - Version of Windows that is installed on the computer .
&gt; - Time zone for the computer &apos;s internal clock .
&gt; - Version of the Telemetry Log .
&gt; - Version of Office that is installed on the computer .
&gt; This information can be useful when you are interpreting the issues and events listed on the * * Events * * worksheet .
- * * Warning * * The issue could cause data loss or result in reduced visual fidelity .
- * * Critical * * The issue could cause significant loss of functionality or lead the application to crash .
# # # Table 2 . Types of events displayed in the Telemetry Log
Use the following table ( Table 2 ) to interpret the records that are displayed in the Telemetry Log .
The Telemetry Log provides large enterprises , individual users , and developers with a simple tool for monitoring their critical Office solutions . By identifying problematic Office solutions before a large-scale upgrade , businesses can more reasonably predict the cost of adopting Office 2013 .

# Quick steps for learning to develop a provider
To develop an OSC provider , you need to complete the following general steps :
- In parallel with implementing interfaces , test and debug the OSC provider .
- Deploy the OSC provider .
- Do final testing before release .
# # Step A : Implementing interfaces
An OSC provider implements interfaces so that the OSC can use these interfaces to obtain necessary information about or from the social network , through the OSC provider . Such information includes the following :
- How to present the account logon dialog to a user .
- When to refresh friends or activities information on the Contact Card or People Pane .
The topic &#91; Debugging a Provider &#93; ( debugging-a-provider.md ) suggests debugging procedures you can use while developing an OSC provider .
See the following topics to learn about deployment requirements :
Depending on your social network and the OSC provider , there are usually provider-specific tests you should carry out before you release your provider . For a suggested list of tests , see &#91; Getting Ready to Release an OSC Provider &#93; ( getting-ready-to-release-an-osc-provider.md ) .

6 . Performs the following tasks if the NEEDS _ PREPROCESSING message flag is set :
- Notifies the MAPI spooler that the queue has changed .
- Returns control to the client , and message flow continues in the MAPI spooler .
- The MAPI spooler performs the following tasks :
- Locks the message by calling IMsgStore : : SetLockState .
- Performs the needed preprocessing by calling all of the preprocessing functions in the order of registration . Transport providers call IMAPISupport : : RegisterPreprocessor to register preprocessing functions .
- Calls IMessage : : SubmitMessage on the open message to indicate to the message store that preprocessing is complete .
* * The message store provider * * :
- Calls IMAPISupport : : CompleteMsg if the message was preprocessed or the message store provider wants the MAPI spooler to complete message processing which is recommended so that messaging hooks can be invoked . Message flow continues with the MAPI spooler as described in the following procedure .
- Unlocks the message if it is locked .
- Returns to the client . Message flow is complete .
2 . Performs the following tasks if the message store is not tightly coupled to a transport , not all of the recipients were known to the message store , or the NEEDS _ SPOOLER flag is set :

title : &quot; Developing a Project Online application using the client-side object model &quot;
Microsoft Project started as desktop application in the early 1990 &apos;s . Today , Project is much more , as its several varieties attest :
- Project Online is a Microsoft-hosted service that provides companies with a PMO-level solution to coordinate and manage projects , programs , and portfolios . A different offering than the desktop editions , Project Online can maintain and track project details throughout the life of a project .
This article focuses on an application that uses the .NET CSOM interface .
Start with a base system running Windows 10 , and add the following items :
In developing a desktop application for SharePoint , the preferred interface is the Project client side object model ( CSOM ) .
The application setup consists of creating a new project , linking the appropriate assemblies and declaring the needed namespaces . Visual Studio presents several types of development projects .
2 . For this application , specify the following items . Keywords encountered on the screen have a bold attribute :
4 . Add the PrjoctServer Client namespace to the .cs file .
Add the SharePoint 2013 SDK assemblies using the NuGet Package Manager Console .
2 . In the Package Manager Console , enter the following command and press \ &lt; ENTER \ &gt; :
3 . Add the namespaces to the .cs file :
The System.Security assembly is part of .NET Framework and was installed with the framework . The sample application needs one more namespace that provides an encrypted string to the hosting system for authentication . Once authenticated , the application can access projects on the hosting system . Add the System.Security namespace to the .cs file in this way :
4 . Add the System.Security namespace to the .cs file :
# # # Connect to the host system
Project Online is a SharePoint application , so using SharePoint authentication is the correct approach . The following code fragment prepares to access the hosted environment .
# # # List all published projects
1 . Establish a context for communication .
2 . Use the object model to specify an object , collection , or data to retrieve .
This step uses LINQ as a query or as a method . The specification controls what you receive . Often , this step is embedded as the body of the Load method ( step 3 ) .
# # # Make a request
1 . The ProjectContext is specified for the projects to list .
2 . Specify the item to retrieve .
# # # Retrieve high-level project information
The load statement specifies the projects collection context , and adds the StartDate , Phase , and Stage to the query result . The additional properties can be scalar , objects , or collections . Scalar items can be accessed directly . Objects and collections require additional processing , as in the following code fragment .
# # # Retrieve all tasks in a project
1 . Establish the context of the projects collection .
Note that the application is addressing published projects . The context for the current published project is pubProj .
3 . Establish the context for the Tasks collection .
4 . Load the specification to retrieve Task collection , including the appropriate non-default properties .
5 . Execute the query to retrieve the Task collection with the appropriate properties .
The information is now local . The following code fragment processes the published tasks collection by writing the information to the console .
# # # Access information at multiple levels
Each task can have one or more persons ( a.k.a. resource ) contributing toward its completion . The Assignments and Resources collections contain this information for each task .
1 . Obtaining a context for the project task .
3 . Execute the query for the assignments .
5 . Execute the query for the resource .
&gt; - The Assignments collection is explicitly requested in the information from the server because it is not a default property of the Tasks collection . As a collection , a subsequent query is made to pull the collection from the server .
&gt; - The Resource is an object . The query for an assignment includes the resource name associated with the assignment .
Output for tasks 52 , 75 , and 76 of a project :
# # # Access custom enterprise-level fields
1 . Tunnel to the custom field using its common name .
2 . Retrieve the internal name of the custom field .
# # # # Tunnel to the custom field , retrieve its internal name , and used it to query the system
1 . Begin by using the projects context , as described at the beginning of this article .
3 . Load the request .
4 . Execute the Query .
The internal name of the custom field is retrieved . High-level items 1 and 2 are now complete .

Following are the principles and features of the CSOM in Project Server 2013 :
- The CSOM is designed for ease of use . For example , methods and properties directly use or provide data by name , rather than requiring many GUIDs , _ changeXml _ parameters , or passing around datasets .
- The Project Server CSOM implements a subset of the PSI functionality , based on the most common requirements for third-party solutions .
- Microsoft .NET client library in the Microsoft.ProjectServer.Client.dll assembly
- Silverlight library in the Microsoft.ProjectServer.Client.Silverlight.dll assembly
- Windows Phone 8 library in the Microsoft.ProjectServer.Client.Phone.dll assembly
- JavaScript library for web applications in the PS.js file or PS.debug.js file
- Native support for LINQ queries with filtering , to limit the amount of data that is returned
&gt; The CSOM is the preferred interface for third-party Project Server developers . We recommend that you use the CSOM for developing new applications , if the CSOM includes the functionality that your application requires .

# Create a SharePoint-hosted Project Server add-in
Development of Project Server apps with Visual Studio requires the following :
&gt; For an on-premises installation , configure an isolated app domain * before * you create a corporate app catalog .
If you add commercial controls such as a jQuery-based grid or date picker , you can add references to additional JavaScript files in the Default.aspx file .
- In the top text box , type the name that you want the app to display in Project Web App . For example , type Quick Status Update .
- * * Multiple Projects * * : Read or write to more than one project , where the user has the permissions requested .
- * * Single Project * * : Read or write to a project where the user has the permissions requested .
The app shows the display name at the top , which is the value of the * * Title * * element in AppManifest.xml .
- A * * button * * element submits the status changes .
- A * * button * * element refreshes the page .
1 . In Visual Studio , open the Default.aspx file .
Procedure 3 adds the JavaScript functions to read the assignments and create the table rows , and to change and update the assignment percent complete . The actual steps are more iterative in developing an app , where you alternately create some of the HTML code , add and test related styles and JavaScript functions , modify or add more HTML code , and then repeat the process .
1 . In Visual Studio , open the App.js file , and then delete all the content in the file .

# # Deploying the QuickStatus app
&gt; Adding an app to a SharePoint catalog requires SharePoint administrator permissions .
* * Figure 12 . Verifying that you trust the Quick Status app * *
* * Figure 13 . Viewing the Quick Status app on the Site Contents page * *
On the Site Contents page , you can select the * * Quick Status Update * * icon to run the app .
Procedure 6 shows some tests to make with the QuickStatus app .
&gt; The app behavior should be changed so that the * * Update * * button is disabled when there are no assignments .
2 . Run the app where the user has multiple assignments in several different projects and some assignments are not complete . Notice the appearance of the app and perform actions as follows ( see Figure 15 ) :
* * Figure 16 . Refreshing the Quick Status Update page * *
* * Figure 17 . Testing the error message * *
Testing reveals several other changes that should be made in the * * QuickStatus * * app for improved usability . For example :
- To avoid a very large table , the table of assignments should be limited to tasks that are less than 100 % complete . Or , add an option to show all tasks . This problem could also be solved by using a jQuery-based grid instead of a table , where you can easily implement filtering and grid paging .

The drawing used in the code examples in this article contains a single page with two connected shapes on it , one of the shapes being a &quot; Start / End &quot; shape from the &quot; Basic Flowchart &quot; template .
Use the following procedure to create a new Visio 2013 file to use in the remaining procedures in this article .
# # # To create new file in Visio 2013
9 . Close the file and then close Visio 2013 .
# # Select and read package parts from a package
3 . Choose the F5 key to debug the solution . When the program has completed running , choose any key to exit .
The console application produces output similar to the following ( some of the output has been omitted for brevity ) :
# # # To select a specific package part in the package by relationship
# # # To select a specific package part through its relationship to another package part
The Start / End shape should now contain the text &quot; Start process &quot; .
# # Recalculate data in the file
Keep in mind that this is the most costly option from a performance standpoint .
# # # To recalculate values for a single shape
2 . Choose the F5 key to debug the solution . When the program has completed running , choose any key to exit .
&gt; This code relies on the `GetPackagePart` and `SaveXDocumentToPart` methods created previously .
# # # To recalculate the entire document when it is opened
# # Add a new package part to a package
# # # To create a new package part
The custom ribbon looks like Figure 2 when the file is opened in Visio 2013 .
The XML created by the `CreateCustomUI` method looks like the following .

# # Step 3 : Populate the Fields list box
- Insert the following code into the Click event handler of lstMain :
The row corresponding to the resource selected in lstMain is made the current row of `grs` . The * * Details * * list box is then cleared and `rec` is opened with the current row of `grs` as the source .
If the resource is a simple record , `recFields` is called . For more information about `recFields` , see the next step .
No code is implemented if the resource is a structured document .
- Create a new subroutine named `recFields` and insert the following code :
The following illustration shows the basic MAPI message store architecture .
Both the MAPI spooler and MAPI clients communicate with the message store provider to create new messages . Client applications do this when users compose a message . The MAPI spooler does this when it receives an incoming message . In either case , the new message is usually created in the Inbox folder of the message store , if there is one .

WinMLTools currently supports conversion from the following frameworks :
- TensorFlow ( experimental )
In this article , we demonstrate how to use WinMLTools to :
- Convert scikit-learn models into ONNX
- Convert TensorFlow models into ONNX
- Apply post-training weight quantization to ONNX models
- Convert floating point models to 16-bit floating point precision models
- Create custom ONNX operators
&gt; WinMLTools does not currently support Python 3.7 .
WinMLTools has the following dependencies :
To update the dependent packages , run the `pip` command with the `-U` argument .
For different converters , you will have to install different packages .
Because of the lack of image types in ONNX , converting Core ML image models ( that is , models using images as inputs or outputs ) requires some pre-processing and post-processing steps .
First , we load the Core ML model and examine its input and output formats .
In this case , both the input and output are 720x720 BGR-images . Our next step is to convert the Core ML model with WinMLTools .
As you can see , the produced format is identical to the original model input format . However , in this case , it &apos;s not an image because the pixel values are integers , not floating-point numbers . To convert back to an image , truncate values greater than 255 to 255 , change negative values to 0 , and round all decimals to integers .
The following code snippet trains a linear support vector machine in scikit-learn and converts the model into ONNX .
Next , we show how scikit-learn pipelines can be converted into ONNX .
Below is a full example if you want to convert directly from an ONNX binary file .
# # Post-training weight quantization
WinMLTools also supports the compression of models represented in floating point 32 into 8-bit integer representations . This could yield a disk footprint reduction of up to 75 % depending on the model . This reduction is done via a technique called post-training weight quantization , where the model is analyzed and the stored tensor weights are reduced from 32-bit floating point data into 8-bit data .
Here is some information about the input parameters to `quantize` :
- `nbits` : The number of bits to represent quantized values . Currently only 8 bits is supported .
# # Create custom ONNX operators
1 . Create the custom function for the ONNX sub-graph building .
2 . Call `winmltools.convert _ keras` or `winmltools.convert _ coreml` with the map of the custom layer name to the custom function .
3 . If applicable , implement the custom layer for the inference runtime .
The following example shows how it works in Keras .

Once converted , all weights and inputs are float16 . Here &apos;s how you can work with float16 inputs and outputs :
* Recommended usage .
* Converts colors and tensorizes into float16 .
* Supports bgr8 and 8-bit image formats , which can be converted safely into float16 without data loss .
* Advanced path .
* Float32 cast into float16 .
* For images , this is safe to cast , as bgr8 is small and fits .
* You need to convert to float16 and pass the inputs as float32 , which will be cast down into float16 .
&gt; Most of the time , the operator is still performing 32-bit math . There is less risk for overflow , and the result is truncated to float16 . However , if the hardware advertises float16 support , then the runtime will take advantage of it .
# # Pre-processing input data
WinML also leverages the entire hardware stack ( CPU , GPU , and so on ) to provide the most efficient conversions for a particular device and scenario .

# # # How do rules work ?
1 . If it meets all the conditions , evaluation continues with step 2 .
2 . If it does not meet any of the exceptions , evaluation continues with step 3 .
2 . If the &quot; stop processing more rules &quot; action is not specified , the rules engine loads the next rule in the rule list and starts over at step 1 .
* * Figure 1 : Rules engine overview * *
- These messages are sent to a distribution list called &quot; Internet Cat Video Enthusiasts &quot; .
- Your users want to read these messages eventually , they just don &apos;t want them cluttering their Inbox . They &apos;d rather file them in a folder called &quot; Cats &quot; .
- Your users want to read messages sent to this distribution list by their mother right away , because Mom sends the funniest videos .
This tells the rules engine the following : &quot; When a message arrives that is sent to the &apos; Internet Cat Video Enthusiasts &apos; distribution list , move it to the &apos; Cats &apos; folder , unless the message is from Mom . &quot;
&#124; Exceptions &lt; br / &gt; &#124; From &apos; Mom &apos; &lt; br / &gt; &#124;
Shortly after creating this rule , a new message comes in . A coworker Hope sends a message to the distribution list . If we mentally perform the work of the rules engine , the message meets all the conditions ( it is sent to &apos; Internet Cat Videos Enthusiasts &apos; ) , and it meets none of the exceptions ( it isn &apos;t from &apos; Mom &apos; ) , so the rule applies and the message gets moved to the &apos; Cats &apos; folder .

The * * User * * element provides user-specific information .
Autodiscover requests and responses must be UTF-8 encoded .
Affinity in Exchange is cookie based . The client triggers the creation of the cookie by including specific headers in the subscription request , and then the subscription response contains the cookie . The client then sends that cookie in subsequent requests to ensure that the request is routed to the right Mailbox server .
More specifically , affinity in Exchange is handled by the following :
- X-PreferServerAffinity — An HTTP header that is included in the initial subscription request with the X-AnchorMailbox header and is set to true to indicate that the client is requesting that affinity be maintained with the Mailbox server .
# # How do I maintain affinity by using the EWS Managed API or EWS ?
- Include the X-AnchorMailbox header with a value set to the SMTP address of the anchor mailbox user .
- Include the X-PreferServerAffinity header with a value set to true .
5 . In the subscription response , get the X-BackEndOverrideCookie value . Include this value in each of the subsequent subscription requests for users in this group .
Note that the server uses the X-PreferServerAffinity and X-BackendOverrideCookie values together to perform the routing to the mailbox server . The X-AnchorMailbox header is also required , but is ignored by the server if the other two values are valid . If X-AnchorMailbox and X-PreferServerAffinity are in a request and X-BackendOverrideCookie is not included , the X-AnchorMailbox value is used to route the requests .
# # What throttling values do I need to take into consideration ?
* * Table 1 . Default throttling values * *
- Sa1 can open the connection in the following ways :
1 . Without impersonation , so the connection is charged against sa1 .
- If the connection limit is hit , the following workarounds are available :
- If option 2 is used , the code can impersonate another user — m2 for example .
# # Example : Maintaining affinity between a group of subscriptions and the Mailbox server
* * Figure 1 . Autodiscover settings used to group mailboxes * *
* * Figure 2 . Creating mailbox groups * *
For the purpose of this example , we &apos;ll focus on Group A. We would use the same steps for group B , but use a different X-AnchorMailbox value for that group .
So Alfred &apos;s subscription request looks like this .
Using the X-BackEndOverrideCookie from Alfred &apos;s response and the X-AnchorMailbox header , the subscription request is created for Sadie , the other member of Group A. Sadie &apos;s subscription request looks like this .

# Exporting and importing items by using EWS in Exchange
Learn about exporting and importing appointments , emails , contacts , tasks , and other mailbox items by using the EWS Managed API or EWS in Exchange .
- Exchange item types . We recommend this approach for importing and exporting items to and from other systems and files .
- Item-level capability ( EWS only ) . We recommend this option for exporting or copying from one Exchange server or mailbox and importing to another .
- MIME streams in the form of common standard file formats such as iCalendar and vCard . Because the property set is limited and MIME conversion is costly , we recommend the approach only for importing or exporting a small amount of data .

Find information about the Exchange writer in Exchange 2013 for backup and restore operations .
The Exchange writer coordinates with the Exchange services ( operating on behalf of the requester ) to prepare the database files for backups , freeze the IO activity resulting from Exchange transactions before backing up the database , and then unfreeze and truncate log files after the backup is complete .
During a restore , your backup and restore application instructs the Exchange writer to coordinate with the Exchange store ( operating on behalf of the requester ) to verify the restore targets , rename the database file if necessary , and then replay the transaction logs as needed . The Exchange writer supports both backups and restores .
# # Interactions between the Exchange writer , VSS , and VSS requesters

Learn about calendars , calendar folders and items , appointments , and meetings in Exchange .
You &apos;re probably familiar with many of the calendar features in email clients like Outlook , which enable you to track appointments , schedule meetings , check people &apos;s availability , invite attendees , and change or cancel meetings .
Calendar-related features in Exchange are a little different than what you see in a client like Outlook . Instead of displaying information , EWS in Exchange enables you to do things like create , store , send , or change information . To use EWS to work with calendars , you &apos;ll need to be familiar with concepts such as information storage , time , recurrence , and message flow . More specifically , you &apos;ll need to be familiar with the following :
- Meeting requests , responses , scheduling , attendees , resources , rooms , and availability
- Recurring series , recurrence patterns , exceptions , and single instance appointments and meetings
Fortunately , EWS and the EWS Managed API provide a rich set of operations and methods that enable you to perform a wide range of calendar-related tasks . For example , using the EWS Managed API , you can create a meeting and send invitations to attendees with just a few lines of code , as shown in the following example .
# # Calendar folders and calendar items
# # Meetings and appointments
Both appointments and meetings can be single instances or part of a &#91; recurring series &#93; ( recurrence-patterns-and-ews.md ) , but because appointments don &apos;t include attendees , rooms , or resources , they do not require a message to be sent .
2 . A list of prospective attendees , resources , and rooms is created .
3 . The availability status of attendees is checked .
4 . A meeting request is sent to attendees .
# # Calendars and time

title : &quot; Setting up your Exchange application development environment &quot;
# Setting up your Exchange application development environment
To create an EWS Managed API application , you &apos;ll need access to the following :
# # Development environment for EWS
You can use EWS to develop your application in a couple of different ways . The simplest way to use EWS is to create text files that contain your XML requests , and transmit them to Exchange . To do this , here is what you need :
- A simple text editor , like Notepad , to edit your XML request . Any text editor will do , although you might want one that will help with your XML syntax validation like XMetal .
- A tool or application that can send and receive SOAP XML requests and responses , in order to communicate with Exchange .
When you work with raw XML , it &apos;s also helpful to have a basic understanding of XML formatting .
The second way to use EWS is to create an autogenerated proxy that enables you to work with the operations by using a .NET language like C # . Here is what you need to work with an autogenerated proxy :
If you use an autogenerated proxy , you &apos;ll want to have some familiarity with C # programming .
The * * AddDelegate * * operation adds one or more delegates to a principal &apos;s mailbox and sets specific access permissions .
The following example shows a &#91; FindItem &#93; ( finditem.md ) request . The request returns items from the search results that start after the second third of all the items in the result set .

Learn about the throttling policies that affect EWS when you are using Exchange .
&gt; Do not set throttling polices to * * null * * . This will set the policy to equal unlimited , which indicates that a throttling policy isn &apos;t set .
Exchange on-premises provides Exchange Management Shell cmdlets that you can use to set and get throttling policy . Exchange Online does not provide access to the throttling policy cmdlets .
You can use the following cmdlets to display throttling polices for an on-premises Exchange Server deployment :
Use the following command to show the default throttling policy for Exchange 2010 .
Use the following command to show the global throttling policy ( which equates to the default throttling policy in Exchange 2010 ) in Exchange 2013 .
&gt; When the * * ThrottlingPolicyId * * property is blank , the default policy is applied to the mailbox .

# # Throttling policy parameters that affect EWS search operations
You can search an Exchange mailbox folder in two ways :
- By using the Exchange Search service ( content indexing ) .
If you can &apos;t use an AQS search , avoid using overly complex search filters . Also try to avoid creating search filters based on computed values if the query involves extended MAPI properties . AQS search was introduced in Exchange 2010 .

# # # Using a query string
If you compare the results of this search to the results of the * * SearchFilter.ContainsSubstring * * search example earlier , this search will contain more results . The search filter search will return only items that have &quot; meeting notes &quot; in the subject , while this search will return items that have &quot; meeting notes &quot; in the subject , body , and other fields .
This is closer , but the results are still not quite the same . When you use a query string with multiple words , you will get matches even if the words are not in the order you specify , or even if they &apos;re not adjacent to each other . With the query string &quot; subject : meeting notes &quot; , you will get matches for &quot; meeting notes &quot; , &quot; notes from the meeting &quot; , and so on . To further refine , you can wrap the search terms in double quotes to indicate that you want that phrase only .

# # SendItem ( E-mail Message ) request example
The following example shows a successful SendItem response .
A delegate who tries to send an e-mail message that is located in the principal &apos;s Drafts folder with the SendAndSaveCopy option set to save a copy in the Sent Items distinguished folder will silently fail to move a copy of the sent item to the Sent Items distinguished folder . The item will remain in the principal &apos;s Drafts folder . The workaround for this issue is to specify the principal &apos;s mailbox in the &#91; DistinguishedFolderId &#93; ( distinguishedfolderid.md ) element .
An additional scenario to consider is when a delegate creates an e-mail message and saves it to the Drafts folder of the delegate &apos;s mailbox . If the delegate tries to send the item and save a copy to the principal &apos;s Sent Items distinguished folder , the message is sent correctly , the draft message remains in the delegate &apos;s Drafts folder , the sent message does not appear in either the delegate &apos;s or principal &apos;s Sent Items folder , and the response is a success .

# Improving performance when using Autodiscover for Exchange
- Trying each candidate — This requires an HTTP request / response to each candidate endpoint .
- Trying other alternatives — When the candidates in your Autodiscover endpoint candidate pool don &apos;t produce results , you can do an unauthenticated GET request ( HTTP request / response ) and a DNS lookup .
# # Consider the need for SCP lookup
When SCP objects are present and configured well , they can speed up the Autodiscover process . In other situations , however , they can slow it down . If SCP isn &apos;t used in your environment , skip the entire SCP lookup portion of the Autodiscover process to save time .
Even if you are already caching , evaluate how long you cache configuration information . The standard is to &#91; refresh Autodiscover information every 24 hours &#93; ( how-to-refresh-configuration-information-by-using-autodiscover.md ) , but you might be able to extend that time . You should test with your target environments and come up with a &quot; time-to-live &quot; for your configuration that works for you .

title : &quot; Folders and items in EWS in Exchange &quot;
# Folders and items in EWS in Exchange
Learn about folders and mailbox items and how your EWS Managed API or EWS client represents them .
Folders are the organizing element of an Exchange mailbox . Folders can contain mailbox items , such as email messages , contacts , appointments , meetings , and tasks , or they can contain other folders . Exchange includes different types of folders , but the folder types are similar to each other . The main difference between them is the type of item they contain .
* * Figure 2 . Item and system folders in a mailbox * *
Of the folders in a mailbox , some are special folders . These equate to well-known folders in the EWS Managed API , or distinguished folders in EWS . Some of these folders have restrictions on the folder name , where they are located in the folder structure , and whether they can be deleted . Other &quot; generic &quot; ( non-special ) folders do not have the same restrictions . It is important for you to be familiar with the following well-known or distinguished folders because they are the root system , user , and search folders , and are applicable to most implementations .
* * Table 2 . Primary well-known and distinguished folders * *
Public folders are designed for shared access and provide an easy and effective way to collect , organize , and share information with other people in your workgroup or organization . You can also use public folders to archive distribution group content .

title : &quot; Delegate access and EWS in Exchange &quot;
# Delegate access and EWS in Exchange
Find out how to use the EWS Managed API and EWS in Exchange to provide delegate access to users &apos; mailboxes .
# # How does delegate access work ?
Delegate access enables users to access some or all of the mailbox owner &apos;s folders and act on behalf of the mailbox owner . The mailbox owner can be a user , or a resource , like a conference room . For example , a receptionist can be granted delegate permissions to a conference room &apos;s calendar folder , to handle booking requests . You can use the EWS Managed API or EWS to enable the mailbox owner or an administrator to add a delegate , specify what folders the delegate can access , and then specify permissions for that folder . Delegates can be granted access to the following folders :
* * Table 2 . Delegate permission levels * *
&#124; None &lt; br / &gt; &#124; This is the default value for all folders . &lt; br / &gt; &#124;
&#124; Author &lt; br / &gt; &#124; A delegate can read and create items , and modify and delete items they create . For example , a delegate can create task requests and meeting requests directly in the mailbox owner &apos;s Task or Calendar folder , and then send either item on the mailbox owner &apos;s behalf . &lt; br / &gt; &#124;
&#124; Editor &lt; br / &gt; &#124; A delegate can do everything an Author can do , and also modify and delete the items the mailbox owner created . &lt; br / &gt; &#124;
&#124; Custom &lt; br / &gt; &#124; The mailbox owner has granted a custom set of permissions to the delegate . &lt; br / &gt; &#124;
* * Figure 2 . Requesting explicit and implicit access to an item or folder * *
You can set explicit access in many different scenarios . Essentially , any time you &apos;re sending a folder ID in a method or operation , you can set explicit access . This can include finding folders , finding appointments , getting items , finding conversations , and so on .
# # # Explicit access and the EWS Managed API
- And more !
You can use the * * FolderId * * parameter in each of these methods to identify the mailbox owner &apos;s target folder , as follows .
In this case the item ID is returned , and then the delegate can then use implicit access to make changes to the item by using the item ID .

title : &quot; Get attachments by using EWS in Exchange &quot;
# Get attachments by using EWS in Exchange
Learn how to get attachments from EWS items by using the EWS Managed API or EWS in Exchange .
You can get attachments from an item by using the EWS Managed API or EWS . Because the initial call to get an item only includes metadata about the attachment collection on the item , retrieving attachments is always a two-step process . First , retrieve the item . Next , retrieve the attachment .
# # Get attachments from an email by using the EWS Managed API
Note that you cannot move or copy the item attachment to another folder because the item attachment is not a strongly-typed item , so if you &apos;re trying to move an attachment to a different folder , use the following code example and then &#91; import the file &#93; ( how-to-import-items-by-using-ews-in-exchange.md ) into a different folder .
title : &quot; Perform an AQS search by using EWS in Exchange &quot;
# Perform an AQS search by using EWS in Exchange
Find out how to search with query strings and AQS in your EWS Managed API or EWS application .
- * * Custom properties aren &apos;t searched . * * Query string searches are performed against an index , and custom properties are not included in that index . If you need to search custom properties , use a search filter instead .
- * * Limited control for string searches . * * Query string searches always ignore case , and are always substring searches . If you want to do case-sensitive , prefix , or exact match searches , use a search filter .
# # Creating a query string
# # # Using a string value type
- Do you have the project plans ?
You can change the search to require the whole word rather than matching prefixes by enclosing the string in quotation marks . Searching for subject : &quot; project &quot; would eliminate the &quot; December sales projections &quot; value from the list of matches . Note that the value is still not case-sensitive .
If you enclose multiple words in quotation marks , they are treated as a single phrase . Searching for subject : &quot; project plan &quot; would only match the &quot; Project plan &quot; subject from the previous list .
# # # Using an item type value type
You can use the following item type values with the * * kind * * keyword to limit your search results to only a specific type of item , such as email or meeting requests :
- im ( corresponds to instant messages )
- meetings ( corresponds to appointments and meeting requests )
# # # Using a date value type
# # # Using a Boolean value type
# # # Using a number value type
# # # Using logical operators
* * Table 2 . Supported logical operators * *
Notice that you can use these operators to join multiple criteria together or to join multiple values within a single keyword / value pair together . However , when joining multiple values in a single keyword / value pair , you should use parentheses to enclose the multiple values . To understand why , consider searching with from : &quot; Sadie Daniels &quot; OR &quot; Hope Gross &quot; . This search actually is interpreted as the following criteria :
- The item is from Sadie Daniels , OR
- The item has the phrase &quot; Hope Gross &quot; in any of its indexed properties .
In contrast , from : ( &quot; Sadie Daniels &quot; OR &quot; Hope Gross &quot; ) is interpreted as :
The * * MarkAllItemsAsRead * * element contains the request to mark all the items in a folder as read .

title : &quot; Handling Autodiscover error messages &quot;
# Handling Autodiscover error messages
The first type of error you might encounter when sending Autodiscover requests is the HTTP status . If the HTTP status in your response is anything other than 200 ( OK ) , the response payload doesn &apos;t contain the Autodiscover response you were looking for . For simplicity , we can group non-200 status codes into three categories .
# # # SOAP Autodiscover errors
# # # POX Autodiscover errors
# # Handling redirect errors
- By resending your request to a new URL .
When you get a new URL in an Autodiscover redirect response , you should first validate the URL as follows :
- Verify that the URL is an HTTPS URL .
If the URL passes validation , resend the request to this new URL .

* * Figure 1 . Initial synchronization design pattern * *
* * Figure 2 . Ongoing synchronization design pattern * *
However , there are also some drawbacks to using notification-based synchronization :
- Notifications to determine * when * the data changed .
# # Synchronization best practices
- Avoid getting throttled , by doing the following :
- When synchronizing calendar data , proceed as follows :
- When synchronizing search folders :
- Use an approach similar to notification-based synchronization .
- Use notifications to determine when data changes .
You might wonder , can I filter my notifications ( and therefore only trigger synchronization ) if specific properties change ? Although that does seem reasonable , because notification subscriptions are based on the type of change ( create , update , delete ) , and not the property being updated , you cannot filter notifications in this way . Instead , you can do the following :
- Use the notification-based subscription design pattern .
- Discard the response ( don &apos;t parse it or do any property comparisons ) .

title : &quot; Autodiscover for Exchange &quot;
# # Overview of the Autodiscover process
The Autodiscover process essentially has three phases . In phase one , you generate a list of potential Autodiscover servers , and in phase two , you try each server in your list until you ( hopefully ) get a successful response . If none of your candidates worked out , you move on to phase three , which represents a &quot; last ditch &quot; attempt to find an Autodiscover endpoint .
# # # Phase 1 : Defining the candidate pool
* * Table 1 : Autodiscover endpoint candidate sources * *
# # # Phase 2 : Trying each candidate
After you generate an ordered list of potential candidates , the next step is try each one in the list by &#91; sending a request to the URL &#93; ( how-to-get-user-settings-from-exchange-by-using-autodiscover.md ) and validating the results , as shown in Figure 3 . When you get a successful response , you &apos;re done !
- That the endpoint is an HTTPS endpoint . Client applications should not authenticate or send data to a non-SSL endpoint .
&gt; These are just basic security suggestions . Whenever you are working with authentication , make sure that your code meets the security requirements of your organization .
# # # Phase 3 : Trying other alternatives
In some cases you might try all the endpoints in your list , only to find that all of them return an error . Before throwing in the towel , you can try a couple more things : you can send an unauthenticated GET request , or query DNS for an SRV record . If these attempts also don &apos;t yield results , you cannot contact the Autodiscover service .

title : &quot; EWS client design overview for Exchange &quot;
Learn about the design considerations for developing with EWS for Exchange .
- The XML structure has been tokenized to make Exchange ActiveSync a more compact protocol .
# # Options for EWS client development
- The EWS autogenerated proxies
- A custom EWS client API
# # # EWS Managed API
The following are some of the benefits of using the EWS Managed API :
- It provides an intuitive object model .
- It abstracts the complexities of the service description in the WSDL and schema files .
- It includes client-side business logic .
- It handles the web requests and responses and object serialization and deserialization .
- It is Microsoft-supported .
- You can use the .NET Framework for development .
- It implements Autodiscover in addition to most parts of the EWS object model .
You might choose to use the EWS web service API instead of the EWS Managed API for any of the following reasons :
- Your application does not use the .NET Framework .
- You don &apos;t want to distribute the EWS Managed API assembly .
- Your application uses features that aren &apos;t implemented in the EWS Managed API .
To learn more , see &#91; Get started with EWS Managed API client applications &#93; ( get-started-with-ews-managed-api-client-applications.md ) .
# # # EWS autogenerated proxies
Autogenerated client APIs are generated from the EWS WSDL and XML schema definitions . Client object model generators are available for many languages . In general , the autogenerated object models manage object serialization and deserialization . They do not include business logic and the autogeneration process often creates artifacts that make the object model less intuitive to use . Exchange support covers the XML that is sent and received by the client but not the object model .
# # # Custom EWS client API
For some applications that use a small set of EWS functionality , you might create a custom client API to communicate with Exchange . This enables you to consume fewer system resources . This is useful for clients that run on memory-constrained devices , such as clients running the .NET Micro Framework .
The schema versions are maintained in the * * ExchangeVersionType * * simple type .
The * * GetClientExtensionResponse * * element contains the response to get configuration information about an app .

title : &quot; Get started with EWS client applications &quot;
# Get started with EWS client applications
Create your first application by using Exchange Web Services ( EWS ) in Exchange .
If you already have an Exchange mailbox account , you can skip this step . Otherwise , you have the following options for setting up an Exchange mailbox for your first EWS application :
# # Create your first EWS application
The EWS application that you will create shows two typical scenarios for using EWS :
1 . Get information from an Exchange mailbox and display that information to the user .
2 . Perform an action , such as sending an email , and check the response to see if the action succeeded .
# # # Set up the solution
First , create a new console application solution using Visual Studio . When the solution is ready , create a new object called Tracing.cs. Use this object to write information to both the console and a log file so that you can review the results after you run your code . Paste the following code into the Tracing.cs file .
Next , open the Program.cs file . You will put the rest of the code for the example in this file .
First , set up the shell of the program . The program will :
1 . Create a log file so that the request and response can be written to disk for later study .
3 . Call the sample methods .
Replace the `Main` method in the Program.cs with the following code .
- Making an EWS request to the Exchange server .
- Parsing the returned XML response for the requested information .
- Handling common exceptions and error messages .
# # # Send an email message
- Creating and sending an email .
- Parsing the returned XML response to determine if the email was correctly sent .
Add the following code to the SendTestEmail method that was stubbed out after the main method . After you run the application , you can open the GetStartedWithEWS.log file to see the XML request that was sent to the Exchange server and the response that the server returned .
Now that you &apos;ve written your first EWS application , you &apos;re ready to discover other ways to use EWS . Here are some ideas to get you started :
The * * GetReminders * * element specifies a request to get reminders .
The * * CanRenameOrMove * * element indicates whether a managed folder can be renamed or moved by the customer .
The * * MeetingDurationInMinutes * * element specifies the duration of the meeting to be suggested .

# # Working with identifiers
The Exchange server handles identifiers in a lot of different ways . Consider the following when you develop your EWS Managed API or EWS application :
- Identifiers in Exchange are opaque . For example , the EwsId is created from several pieces of information that are not important to you as the developer , but are important to Exchange .
* * Table 2 . Identifier-related errors * *
For example , an EntryID is a unique identifier generated by the MAPI message store that is assigned by the store when the item is saved . To use an EntryID in your application , you first need to convert it to an EwsId .
You can use the * * ConvertId * * operation or method to convert several different identifier formats .

- Managing data retention .
# # Running more in less time , in Azure
- Gather : As the tasks complete , collect their outputs .
# # Reporting on the Results
If you need to do more analysis , you can use Apache data science tools like Spark , Hadoop , and others via either HDInsight or Databricks . Use these more for when the analysis needs to be done regularly and you want to automate the workflow . This is also useful for live analysis of large datasets .
Much of the data you bring into the system needs to be preserved for future audits . Data retention requirements typically range from 7 to 10 years , but requirements vary . Minimal retention involves :
- Snapshot of the original inputs to the model . This includes assets , liabilities , assumptions , ESGs , and other inputs .

Bing will also provide :
- Bounding boxes for regions of interest in the image ( e.g. clothing , furniture items ) .
# # Implement Your Own
- Featurization , encoding or &quot; hashing &quot;
* Figure 1 : Example of Visual Search Pipeline *
* Figure 2 : An Example from The Deep Fashion Dataset *
# # # Filtering the Images
Most benchmark datasets - such as those mentioned before - have already been pre-processed .
- Any metadata about the images ( size , tags , product SKUs , description )
- Data generated by the machine learning model ( for instance a 4096-element numerical vector per image )
You may also want to require a minimum number of useful data points ( e.g. an image identifier or key , a product sku , a description , a tag field ) .
* Figure 3 : CosmosDB Hierarchical Resource Model *
Other applicable technologies are a combination of Azure SQL Database ( if fixed schema is acceptable ) and blobs , or even Azure Tables and blobs for inexpensive and fast storage and retrieval .
The encoding process extracts salient features from pictures in the database and maps each of them to a sparse &quot; feature &quot; vector ( a vector with many zeros ) that can have thousands of components . This vector is a numerical representation of the features ( e.g. edges , shapes ) that characterize the picture – akin to a code .

title : SKU optimization for consumer brands using Azure ML and analytics
# SKU optimization for consumer brands solution guide
- Which SKUs are performing best in a given market or store ?
- Which SKUs are low performing and should be replaced by higher performing SKUs ?
- What other insights can we derive about our consumer and market segments ?
# # Automate decision making
- Understand SKU portfolio performance and manage low performers .
- Optimize distribution of SKUs to reduce out-of-stocks .
- Understand how new SKUs support short-term and long-term strategies .
- Create repeatable , scalable , and actionable insights from existing data .
# # # An in-depth look at the problem : choice models
- the number of SKUs
- SKU and quantity purchased
- time stamps of events ( for example , purchase )
- stock level of every SKU at any point in time
In this document , for simplicity we will only consider transaction data and SKU data , not external factors .
Even so note that , given a set of n products , there are 2n possible assortments . This makes the optimization problem a computationally intensive process . Evaluating all possible combinations is impractical with a large number of products . So typically , assortments are segmented by category ( for example , cereals ) , location and other criteria to reduce the number of variables . Optimization models try to “ prune ” the number of permutations to a workable subset .
We often use MNL as a benchmark for other models because of its tractability in estimation of parameters and evaluation of results . In other words , if you do worse than MNL , your algorithm is of no use .
Most recently , implementation of MNL models on GPUs have been proposed to compute complex models with a number of parameters that would make them intractable otherwise .
- K is the number of rankings
- n is the number of products
- there can be exactly 1 choice for each ranking
- under a ranking k , a product i can be chosen only if it is part of the assortment
- if a product i is included in the assortment , none of the less preferable options in ranking k can be chosen
# # # The importance of data
- Second , the results are easily consumable by planners via a dashboard .
Azure Data Factory is a managed service with components called “ activities ” that consume and / or produce datasets .
- data movement ( for example , copying from source to destination )
- data transformation ( for example , aggregating with a SQL query , or running a stored procedure )
In the capture phase , we can leverage the copy activity ( built-in to Data Factory ) to transfer data from a variety of sources ( both on-premises and in the cloud ) into Azure SQL Data Warehouse . Examples of how to do that are provided in the documentation :
- Sales history data for each combination of store and SKU
- SKU codes and description
- SKU attributes that capture features of the products ( for example , size , material ) . These are typically used in parametric models to differentiate between product variants .
# # Training the ML algorithm
However , the data size it can handle is limited to 10 GB ( for now ) and the number of cores available to each component is also limited to 2 ( for now ) .
- Scale independently , to limit costs when you are not training the models .
- Distribute the computation across multiple cores .
- Run the computation “ close ” to the storage to limit data movement .
# # Running the model ( operationalize )
The figure below shows a typical Power BI dashboard . It includes two graphs that show SKU stock information .
- In particular , you may want to develop a custom activity to anonymize the data to be transferred to Azure ( and run it on premises ) .
- All the services mentioned , with the exception of ML studio , support integration with Azure Active Directory for authentication and authorization . If you write your own code , you must build that integration into your application .

# Risk Grid Computing in Banking Overview
Azure provides an elegant solution for risk grid computing using Azure Batch . Customers can use Azure Batch to extend their existing risk computing grid , or to replace on-premises resources with a completely cloud-based solution .
# # # Hybrid network solution
# # # Azure Data Factory
# # Matching processing needs with demand
- Augments existing investments in various on-premises systems .
- Allows existing infrastructure to serve risk analysis needs when demand is low , deallocating Azure-based worker nodes .
- Provides extra capacity to the risk compute grid when demand is high .
Along with efficient use of resources , this arrangement provides other benefits . For independent tasks , adding more workers allows the load to scale linearly . Azure also provides the flexibility to try out a very large VM instance or a machine with several GPU cards . This flexibility enables experimentation and innovation .
For times when more compute capacity is needed , such as quarterly valuations , the extra capacity can also come from Azure Batch auto-scaling . Auto-scaling provides elasticity to your Batch solution . By scaling resources to match needed load , Azure provides significantly greater capacity at a lower cost than owning the hardware .
# # # Migrating additional resources to the cloud
As workloads grow or on-premises datacenter infrastructure ages , organizations can move their entire Batch processing for risk grid computing into Azure .
# # # Growing into Azure
As on-premises machines reach end of life , you can further distribute worker nodes into the cloud . The same can be true for the Batch head node . This inverts the relationship between the on-premises network and Azure . This may be an opportunity to decrease costs by decommissioning any network-to-network products such as Azure ExpressRoute , and any remaining on-premises worker nodes .
# # # Data security considerations for risk grid computing
To mitigate any security , speed , and connection reliability concerns , consider connecting your on-premises network to Azure using Azure ExpressRoute or a VPN Gateway . From there , you may have your on-premises head node provision a cluster of Azure-based worker nodes , spinning them up and down as needed .
Uploading files to Azure Storage before the Batch job begins is another way to take advantage of Batch without the need for a hybrid network . This could be done incrementally , or as a starting process to the Batch run .
title : Overview of E-commerce solution migration to Azure
# Migrating your e-commerce solution to Azure overview
E-commerce , which is primarily focused on the customer journey , has many different attributes . These attributes can be grouped into four main areas : discovery , evaluation , purchase and post-purchase .
To rehost in Azure , there are three phases :
- * * Analysis * * : Identify and inventory on-premises resources like applications , workloads , networking , and security . At the end of this phase , you have complete documentation of the existing system .
- * * Migration * * : Move each subsystem from on-premises to Azure . During this stage , you will use Azure as an extension of your data center with the applications continuing to communicate .
1 . No modifications
1 . Basic modifications such as naming changes
1 . Minor modifications , such as a slight code changes
1 . Incompatible workloads which require extra effort to move
1 . Build out the network .
3 . Provision storage pieces in Azure .
Once a subsystem has been moved to Azure , test to make sure that everything works as expected . Once all issues are closed , move the workloads over to Azure .
# # # Microservices + APIs
When bringing data into Azure , consider the 3Ps of data sources and their applicability to the scenarios the retailer wants to enable . The 3Ps of data sources are Purchased , Public , and Proprietary .
Initially , data is loaded into Azure in its native format , and is stored accordingly . Receiving and managing disparate data sources can be daunting , but Microsoft Azure offers services to load data into the cloud quickly and easily , making it available for processing in the data management pipeline .
Before analysis begins , the data must be prepared . This shaping of data is important to ensure quality of predictive models , reporting KPIs and relevancy of data .
Data stored in Azure has great performance backed up by a solid service-level agreement ( SLA ) . Data services provide easier to manage solutions , high availability , replication across multiple geographic locations and — above all — Azure offers the data stores and services needed to drive Machine Learning .
- CRM data and other line of business applications
- POS transaction data
First , the data is cleaned and formed appropriately . It is then processed by a machine learning system such as HDInsight or Apache Spark . To do this , existing data is used to train a model , which in turn is used in analysis of data . The trained model is updated periodically with new known good data to increase its accuracy during analysis . Machine learning services use the model to perform an analysis of the data being processed .
- Increase the average eCommerce or POS transaction by bundling products
- Purchase history in CRM to support customer call center inquiries
